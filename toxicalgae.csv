People seeking relief from the heat should avoid swimming, power boating and waterskiing in Ross Island Lagoon where toxic algae has been detected. The algae is harmful to all, but especially dangerous for children and pets. On Sept. 25 the Oregon Health Authority continued to lift a recreation use advisory for the Willamette River due to an algae bloom to now cover only the Ross Island Lagoon in Southeast Portland. Children and pets are at increased risk for exposure. OHA issued the initial advisory on Aug. 15. Water monitoring confirms that the level of cyanotoxins in the Willamette River channel are now below recreational guideline values for people. Check the Oregon Health Authority's current advisories here . A photo looking east from the Hawthorne Bridge showing blue/green algae. People should avoid swimming and high-speed water activities, such as water skiing or power boating, in those areas of the river as the major route of exposure is ingestion of water. Toxins are not absorbed through the skin. However, those with skin sensitivities may get a puffy red rash. Activities such as catch-and-release fishing, hiking, biking, picnicking, bird watching, canoeing, and kayaking are safe, and boating is safe as long as speeds do not create excessive water spray. Sprays could lead to the risk of inhaling the toxins. Children and pets should stay out of the water anywhere near where toxic algae has been identified . Dogs can get extremely ill and even die within minutes to hours from exposure to the toxins by drinking the water, licking their fur, or eating the toxins from floating mats or dried crust along the shore. Outreach teams from the Joint Office of Homeless Services are spreading the word to those living outside that drinking water directly from areas of the river affected by a bloom is especially dangerous. Toxins cannot be removed by boiling, filtering or treating water with camping-style filters.

In recent years, this estuary has experienced numerous phytoplankton bloom events due to increased seasonal temperatures coupled with environmental impacts. Algal blooms produce a myriad of small organic molecules, many of which can be toxic to humans and animals. Among these phycotoxin producers is Microcystis aeruginosa , a freshwater cyanobacterium, which can be found in the Southern IRL. Measurable amounts of microcystins have been found in nasal swabs of people who live and work near the area, although finding microcystins in mucosal membranes may be evidence that the body is doing its job to eliminate them. To help uncover potential human health hazards associated with harmful algae blooms in the IRL, researchers from Florida Atlantic University ’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute collected water samples from 20 sites within the lagoon during wet and dry seasons over a three-year period. The samples were extracted to concentrate organic molecules and these extracts were used in testing. To identify the presence of known or emerging toxins, researchers used a panel of immortalized human cell lines corresponding to the liver, kidney and brain to measure cytotoxicity. Human cell lines engineered to express ion transporters, red blood cells, and the activity against a protein phosphatase enzyme, also were used in the study. These cells and biological activities were selected as they are known to be affected by algal toxins and show unique patterns of activity for known toxins. Samples were tested at high concentrations to detect as many metabolites as possible, and those that presented more than 50 percent cytotoxicity were considered active. Samples that exhibited high toxicity were further subjected to liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis to assess the metabolites present in the sample. Results of the study, published in the journal Toxins , show that each control toxin induced a consistent pattern of cytotoxicity in the panel of human cell lines assayed. During blooms, cytotoxicity due to a single type of toxin was obvious from this pattern. In the absence of blooms, the observed cytotoxicity reflected either a mixture of toxins or it was caused by an unidentified toxin. “The most interesting observation from our study is that with the cell lines used, we could follow the patterns of known toxins,” said Esther Guzmán , Ph.D., corresponding author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. “Known toxins were seen only during blooms. Because cell toxicity was seen in the absence of blooms, it suggests that there might be either emergent toxins or a combination of toxins present at those times. Our findings suggest that other toxins with the potential to be harmful to human health may be present in the lagoon.” Among the study findings, the most northern sites of the lagoon exhibited less toxicity than sites to the south. Cytotoxic blooms were seen both in the south ( Microcystis ) and the north ( Pyrodinium ) of the lagoon. In the absence of blooms, South Fork, South Fork 2, North Fork and Middle Estuary (sites one to four) in the Southern IRL and Banana River, and North Banana River (NASA) (sites 14 and 15) in the Northern IRL appeared to have the most cytotoxicity during the time of the assessment. In contrast, Jensen, Fort Pierce Inlet, Harbor Branch Link Port Canal, Vero Beach Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory, and Vero Beach Barber Bridge (sites six to 10) appeared healthier as there were few samples with cytotoxicity above 50 percent in these sites, although there was statistically significant variation in these sites. “A major question we sought to answer in this study was whether there are unrecognized toxins or other signaling molecules associated with harmful algal blooms in the lagoon,” said Amy Wright , Ph.D., co-author and a research professor, FAU Harbor Branch. “The data collected to date suggest that this is indeed the case. Importantly, using an assay panel to assess the presence of toxic materials could allow for better monitoring of human health impacts, especially from emerging toxins within the system.” The researchers note that microcystins are primarily a threat to human health in the lagoon during blooms, and because of the necessity of active transport, the toxin would need to be ingested or inhaled to present a threat to humans. “Ingestion can be avoided by filtering water through activated charcoal,” said Guzmán. “Similarly, effects due to inhalation are effectively blocked by the mucus membrane, which traps toxins that are subsequently eliminated through coughing. However, pet and wildlife exposures can still occur.” Study co-authors Tara A.

Dead sea lions and dolphins are washing up by the hundreds on the Pacific Coast. By Max Gorden , Emilee Speck Source FOX Weather Facebook Twitter Email Copy Link 03:36 Mammals getting sick due to toxic algae along California coast Hundreds of dead sea lions and dolphins are washing up on California beaches and a toxic algae bloom is being blamed. FOX Weather's Max Gorden with more about what’s going on. REDONDO BEACH, California – Sea mammal rescue organizations in Southern California are declaring an emergency due to deadly toxic algae bloom making marine mammals sick. Hundreds of dead sea lions and dolphins are washing up from the Pacific Ocean , and sick sea lions are filling up every available space at marine mammal rescues. Marine scientists say the toxic algae bloom produces the neurotoxin ""domoic acid,"" which makes its way through the food chain to small fish and squid, which dolphins and sea lions eat. When consumed, the neurotoxin can kill sea mammals or they wash on shore very sick with seizures. Marine Mammal Care Center CEO John Warner said the toxic algae problem is twofold. ""In Los Angeles County, everyone knows it’s summertime, and many people are out on the beaches, which causes a real human safety issue,"" Warner said. ""But it’s also very stressful on the animals, so the timing is not perfect at all. And we currently have so many animals showing up on the beaches that our hospital is full."" Dr. Alissa Deming, left, and veterinarian assistant Malena Berndt, give anti-seizure medicine to a California Sea Lion named Patsy in a recovery room at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach after it was found in Huntington Beach having seizures from toxic algae blooms Tuesday, June 20, 2023.  (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) (Getty Images) Unfortunately, the dolphins don’t usually make it after washing up, but marine biologists can care for sea lions by giving them an IV if they can get them to a care center. If they make it in time, sea lions can recover after a few days. Scientists say that this bloom is a significant event, and it’s overwhelming some organizations that rescue sick marine mammals. The Marine Mammal Care Center in San Pedro is building more pens because of the influx of sick sea lions. KILLER WHALES SPOTTED SWIMMING OFF NANTUCKET IN ‘UNUSUAL’ SIGHT IN NEW ENGLAND WATERS Toxic algae blooms regularly occur, but scientists say this latest bloom is caused by a seasonal upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich ocean water triggered by wind patterns. Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System Executive Director Dr. Clarissa Anderson said scientists don't know how bad the bloom is or where it originated. ""It appears to be an offshore event, not a nearshore event,"" Anderson said. ""In my career, this is about the worst I’ve seen in terms of the impact on the marine mammal community in a small localized area in Central California to Southern California."" Anyone who sees a sick animal at the beach should not approach it and instead alert a lifeguard or local authorities.

While there have been no human deaths, animals have died from the toxic effects, the report shows. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) seem to be becoming worse nationwide, especially during the summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new report that analyzes data from 2021, 16 states reported a total of 117 human illnesses and at least 2,715 animal illnesses as a result of HAB events. HAB events peak in August, the report found, with 90% of blooms occurring in lakes, reservoirs and other fresh waters. HABs emerge from the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria — also known as blue-green algae, according to the CDC. ""HAB events of public health concern are primarily caused by microalgae (e.g., diatoms and dinoflagellates), cyanobacteria, and the toxins they can produce,"" the CDC said in its report. ""HAB events, which can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature, can have public health, environmental, and economic impacts."" The CDC's report is based on voluntary reporting by public health agencies and their designated environmental health or animal health partners. In 2021, the CDC said 368 HAB events were reported by 16 state jurisdictions, which is a significant increase compared to previous years where less than 250 HAB events were reported in 2020 and 2019. Exposure to high levels of blue-green algae and their toxins can cause illness and death, the CDC said. Several states have reported wildlife, domestic pet and livestock illnesses and deaths in recent years. What did CDC find? Human illnesses from toxic blue-green algae happened predominately in June, the CDC said. The most commonly reported symptoms were gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and generalized, such as headaches and fevers. Of the 117 cases, the CDC said 46% of illnesses were among people younger than 18 years old, suggesting children and teens may be at higher risk of illness than adults. No deaths were reported. Nearly all of the cases of human illness reported water as a source of exposure to HABs, according to the CDC. People were exposed to HABs predominately at public outdoor areas and beaches. Animal illnesses occurred primarily in August and mostly involved wildlife, according to the CDC. Among the cases, the animals most affected were dogs, cattle and bats. At least 2,715 animal cases of illness were reported in 2021 with 76% of wildlife cases classified as confirmed, 67% of domestic cases as probable and 60% of livestock cases as suspect, the CDC said. And 92% of the animals reported ill died. Rotting seaweed, dead fish, no sand: Climate change threatens to ruin US beaches What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. How is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals. Public health officials have said exposure to high levels of blue-green algae and their toxins can cause illnesses, including diarrhea, nausea or vomiting; skin, eye or throat irritation; and allergic reactions or breathing difficulties. Pets and livestock can also get sick or die if they consume large amounts of water containing blooms, scums or benthic mats. Southern California algae bloom: Toxic algae bloom suspected in deaths of sea lions and dolphins on Southern California coast Reported cases nationwide Blue-green algae blooms have been observed across the United States. Some cases have triggered health officials to warn visitors and residents to not swim, wade, boat, eat fish, or let pets sip water from different bodies of water. In its report, the CDC said a large wildlife mortality event occurred in Washington from a single harmful algae bloom and involved at least 2,000 bats. This was the largest bat die-off linked to a harmful algae bloom ever reported to the CDC. Last week, Kansas health officials reported that nine state lakes were impacted by blue-green algae and issued several types of advisories for those areas. The toxic algae has also plagued Florida waterways for years, thriving on excess nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, septic tanks and sewage spills. Several Florida dogs have gotten sick or died from drinking water laden with toxic blue-green algae in recent years. In 2021, Bella, an 8-year-old boxer died after she ate toxin-laced detritus from a canal, marking her as possibly the first reported canine death in Palm Beach County from blue-green algae poisoning. In 2018, six dogs got sick from blue-green algae in the St. Lucie River, one fatally.

strandings. Feature Story | West Coast Deceased dolphin as a result of domoic acid poisoning. Credit: Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute The rapid growth of harmful algae along parts of the Southern California Coast is believed to have killed hundreds of California sea lions and close to 60 dolphins in the first weeks of June. The Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute has fielded more than 1,000 reports of sick and dead marine mammals from June 8 through June 14, said Ruth Dover, co-founder and Managing Director. The Institute is part of the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network , which is coordinated by NOAA Fisheries and responds to live marine mammal strandings in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. “We are managing more than 200 reports of marine mammals in distress each day,” Dover said. “We are doing the best we can to keep up with the intense pace. Please continue to report all sick and injured marine mammals as we are getting to as many animals as we can, as quickly as we can, each day.” The rapid growth of the algae Pseudo-nitzschia causes the production of a neurotoxin called domoic acid. This leads to animal strandings, as the toxin is transferred into the marine food web. Seabirds and marine mammals, such as sea lions and dolphins, ingest the toxin when they eat affected prey. Stranding responders believe domoic acid is behind the deaths given the neurological symptoms exhibited by the animals. They have collected tissue samples for testing to confirm. 3-day forecast of domoic acid concentrations along the California Coast provided by the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System. The darker red reflects the areas most likely to exceed the threshold for a Harmful Algal Bloom. Steer Clear of Stranded Animals Forecasts provided by NOAA CoastWatch and the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System show high concentrations of domoic acid from Orange County north to San Luis Obispo County. Concentrations are especially high around Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The toxin can cause seizures, brain damage, and death. Domoic acid does not affect humans unless they consume it in contaminated food items. “I have never seen anything this intense in terms of the numbers of animals in my 20 years of responding to strandings in this area,” said Michelle Berman Kowalewski, founder and Director of the Channel Islands Cetacean Research Unit . Also part of the Marine Mammal Stranding Network, its team examines and collects samples from dead dolphins and whales in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties. Many of the dolphins have stranded alive and then died, she said. Several of the dolphins and many of the sea lions were pregnant females. Beachgoers should stay clear of stranded animals and keep their pets away from marine mammals. These animals can carry the toxin as well as other diseases that may be harmful to pets. “We are fortunate to have very dedicated responders who are doing their best to respond to these cases, but we also need help from the public to keep a safe distance and let the trained teams do their work,” said Justin Viezbicke, California Stranding Coordinator in NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Region. Deceased dolphin and California sea lions nearby showing symptoms of domoic acid poisoning. Credit: Staci Kaye-Carr, Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute Concentrations Increasing Offshore Seasonal outbreaks of domoic acid poisoning are common along the California coast. Ocean conditions favoring the algae sometimes lead to more widespread outbreaks involving hundreds of animals. Domoic acid does not affect humans unless they consume it in contaminated food items (many of which are prey of marine mammals). Finfish, shellfish, and crustaceans are regularly tested for domoic acid, which in humans can cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning. The spread of domoic acid this year appears to include more offshore areas unlike an episode last year , when the neurotoxin was closer to the shoreline and primarily affected sea lions. The dolphins may reflect an even further offshore distribution of the toxin this year, Viezbicke said, particularly since the nearshore sampling sites are not indicating blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia according to the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Alert Program. Tests of tissue samples collected from the affected animals may help understand how the toxin is spreading and whether any other factors such as illness may be involved, but these analyses take time. “We are trying to learn as much as we can as fast as we can,” Kowalewski said. “As difficult as it is to see these animals die, we want to gather information to help understand how and why this is happening the way it is.” Stranded sea lions, dolphins, and other marine mammals can  be reported to the West Coast Region Stranding Hotline: (866) 767-6114. For stranded live animals in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, residents should call Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute’s Rescue Hotline at (805) 567-1505. For dead whales and dolphins in those counties, people should call Channel Island Cetacean Research Unit at (805) 500-6220.

More than 1,000 marine animals have become sick or died in June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Experts say algal blooms pose a seasonal issue, but climate change may be worsening the problem. Rescue groups are getting more than 200 reports of marine mammals in distress each day. ""I've heard of a number of people walking the beaches who have seen [sick] animal after [sick] animal,"" said David Caron, a biological sciences professor at the University of Southern California. ""Animal rescue groups are scrambling to try to get boots on the ground to get the animals protected."" Sea birds, dolphins and sea lions in particular are becoming ill from the rapid growth of certain species of algae, which produce a toxin called domoic acid. Harmful algal blooms work by disrupting food webs, Dr Caron said. Creatures such as shellfish, anchovies and sardines consume the toxins before then being eaten by larger marine mammals. ""They eat a meal of those highly toxic fish and then they become toxified themselves, and if they get enough of that material, it of course can kill them, which is happening now,"" he said. Santa Barbara and Ventura counties in Southern California have been hit especially hard, according to the NOAA. The Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute, which helps rescue and treat sick animals, said it was receiving more than 200 reports of marine mammals in distress each day. ""We are doing the best we can to keep up with the intense pace,"" institute co-founder Ruth Dover said in a statement. When domoic acid affects marine mammals, they can become disoriented or even convulse and die under water. Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute Sick dolphins and sea lions pictured on a California beach The blooms can pose a danger to humans as well. People can become sick if they consume fish packed with the toxins, though the California Department of Public Health monitors for these levels and closes shellfish beaches when necessary, Dr Caron said. Humans may also attempt to approach larger mammals like sea lions and dolphins if they see them stranded on the beach, but the animals may become aggressive because of the toxins. People should avoid the marine creatures and call rescue organisations, which have been able to save some animals by capturing them, feeding them, and giving them liquids until they can flush the toxins out of their system, Dr Caron said. Algae usually blooms between March and June in California, but the blooms may be peaking later this year because of its long and rainy winter. Red tide is back and killing fish in Florida Experts say that not all species of algae produce harmful toxins, but the ones that do may be expanding to new areas because of climate change. This is because as water temperatures rise, more areas become habitable for harmful algae blooms, which tend to form in warmer water. Scientists are still working to untangle the effects of climate change on organisms living in coastal waters, Dr Caron said. ""But we have a fair amount of evidence, especially in inland waters, that climate change is exacerbating some of the problems that we're seeing with harmful algae,"" he said.

By Kevin Vu , The Texas Tribune Oct. 27, 2023 Updated: 9 AM Central Share Copy URL Republish Twitter Facebook Reddit LinkedIn Email Republish Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Author Dan Egan spoke with The Texas Tribune to discuss his new book, “The Devil’s Element: Phosphorus and a World Out of Balance.” The book takes readers on a deep dive into how phosphorus, a key component in fertilizer that helps support worldwide food production, also causes  toxic algae blooms that have contaminated lakes, rivers and other waterways across the United States. Discovered in the 1600s by a German alchemist in Hamburg, phosphorus’ full potential to fertilize crops wouldn’t be fully realized until the 1800s. Egan’s book details how people have built businesses around extracting phosphorus from materials like the bones of soldiers slain in wars, bird poop off the Guano Islands in South America and phosphate rock found largely in Florida. “This is what the story is about. It’s our constant chase for the next fertilizing substance,” Egan told Tribune environmental reporter Alejandra Martinez. “People thought at the time that this was going to be an endless supply, we would never run out.” Egan said humans have become overly dependent on phosphorus and are burning through the world’s supply at an “unsustainable pace.” “There is no substitute for phosphorus, it is life’s bottleneck,” Egan said. Egan’s book says overuse of phosphorus has led to toxic algae blooms in the Mississippi River basin, Lake Erie and both the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. For the first time since 2018, Texas saw toxic algae blooms this year, near Galveston Bay and the Rio Grande Valley. The algae that blooms when fed by phosphorus — known as cyanobacteria or blue-green algae — causes water to turn into a thick, green poisonous gloop that can “kill dogs and make a swimmer vomit in a matter of seconds after an accidental gulp,” Egan wrote in his book. Climate change is an additional factor in algae growth, with intense spring rains washing chemical fertilizers from farmland into nearby rivers and lakes, Egan wrote. “Right now what we’re doing is we’re putting too much chemical fertilizer and manure on the crop lands,” Egan said in the conversation. “The philosophy was that a little is good, a lot is better, just in case. And so, more would go on the landscape than was needed.” He said that has caused a lot of phosphorus to build up in soils that’s going to leach out over time. “We can’t just flip a switch and it’s going to be problem solved,” Egan said. Farmers can help prevent future algae blooms from contaminating water by consolidating manure into a small area and then processing it using anaerobic digesters to strip out the phosphorus, something he said is “every bit as pure as what’s coming out of a chemical fertilizer factory,” allowing farmers to control the movement and amount of phosphorus used. “It's here and it's not going anywhere until we better control what's coming off the land,” Egan said. “Too many people too often just kind of throw up their hands and think, ‘Well, this is just natural.’ It’s not.” Texans need truth.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a report finding hundreds of harmful algal blooms across the U.S. sickened people and killed animals — a problem that is likely to get worse. Harmful algal blooms , otherwise identified as HABs, stem from the ""rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria"" in water. Some of the algae in these blooms produce toxins that can cause illnesses in both humans and animals, impacting health primarily through water exposure, but also through the air. Here's what to know. Where are the harmful algal blooms? Analyzing data from 2021, the CDC found 368 of these blooms across 16 states that year – Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Michigan and Pennsylvania had the most algal blooms – 77 each – while Utah had the most human illnesses. Washington had the most animal illnesses, as the toxic algae was linked to the deaths of more than 2,000 bats. California had the second-most animal cases, with 444 animals affected. The problem became worse during the summer months with the blooms peaking in August. In 2021, 248 of the blooms had no associated illnesses, while 48 were known to cause human illness, 79 caused animal illness and seven caused illnesses for both groups. More than half of the blooms, however, were filled with toxins. Most were in freshwater sources, such as lakes and reservoirs. In those, a ""green water color"" was frequently reported, the CDC said, although there were reports of illness when the water was clear. Unlike red tide events , which have long plagued Florida's waters, these blooms involve algae or cyanobacteria, which is also referred to as blue-green algae. Red tide, on the other hand, is formed by the bacteria Karenia brevis, which can make the water appear red or brown. How do harmful algal blooms affect humans? The CDC found that 117 people became ill after coming into contact with harmful blooms in 2021, about half of them children and teens. Just under three-quarters of those who became ill sought medical care, but there were no deaths. Most of the human illnesses related to the blooms occurred in June, the CDC found, and primarily in public outdoor areas and beaches. The most common symptoms people reported were gastrointestinal issues – mostly diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain – headaches, fatigue, fever, rashes, itchy and irritated skin, sore throat and coughing. How do harmful algal blooms affect animals? Animals were far more impacted by the harmful blooms in 2021 than humans, according to the CDC. At least 2,715 animals became sick from the blooms, with at least 92% dying from their exposure. Wildlife was overwhelmingly affected, although dogs and cattle were also among those affected. Most of the deaths occurred in Washington, where at least 2,000 bats died. The problem for animals was at its worst in August, when the blooms were at their peak. For pets, the most common symptoms of HAB-related illness were loss of appetite, lethargy, muscle tremors, weakness, vomiting and imbalance, although several other symptoms were reported. Among wildlife, the most common symptom of illness was dark urine. Toxic algal blooms could get worse The CDC said in its report that harmful algal bloom events ""can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature"" – both of which are expected to increase with climate change. As regional and global temperatures warm, so will the temperatures in freshwater systems, Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute says. ""Warmer water temperatures in deep lakes slows down processes that add oxygen to the water, creating dead zones, or areas with less oxygen that are unable to support life,"" according to the institute. ""These dead zones can produce large-scale fish mortality and toxic algal blooms."" Nutrient pollution is also expected to increase, as climate change spurs more extreme weather that can lead to more stormwater runoff. That runoff ""can result in conditions favorable for algal blooms,"" the university says. ""Consequently, with a changing climate, harmful algal blooms can occur more often, in more fresh or marine waterbodies and can be more intense,"" they said, adding that it could also end up affecting drinking water, as freshwater sources will need more treatment than usual.

These effects, along with nutrient pollution, might cause algal blooms to become more severe and to occur more often in more waterbodies. Blooms with the potential to harm human health, pets, livestock, or aquatic ecosystems are referred to as harmful algal blooms, or HABs, and they can also have wide ranging economic impacts. In freshwaters, cyanobacteria (microscopic photosynthetic bacteria previously known as blue-green algae due to their color) are the most common HAB producers. Some cyanobacterial HABs, or cyanoHABs, produce toxins that cause illness in humans and other animals. Climate Factors That Affect HABs: Warming water temperature Toxic cyanobacterial bloom HAB forming cyanobacteria thrive in warm, slow-moving water, and typically occur when water temperatures are warmer. As a result, increases in water temperature with climate change are expected to increase the magnitude and duration of cyanoHABs. Warmer water temperatures favor cyanoHABs in several ways, including: CyanoHAB species grow faster than other algae at warmer temperatures CyanoHABs migrate up and down the water column better than other algae. They get nutrients from the cooler, dark, bottom layers and use them to grow in the warmer, upper layers where there is more light. Other algae cannot do this and are shaded by the CyanoHAB species. CyanoHABs absorb sunlight and release heat, making surface waters even warmer, further increasing their advantages. Changes in salinity In some regions, climate change is predicted to reduce freshwater runoff due to drought and increased evaporation. These effects will combine to increase salinity in inland waters. This can impact irrigation, harm crops, contaminate drinking water, and allow the invasion of salt-tolerant and marine algae to inland lakes. In the southwestern and south-central United States, more salt-tolerant algal HABs known as “golden algae” have regularly recurred, expanded into lagoons, and killed fish in freshwater lakes since 2000. In other regions, increased runoff from more intense rainfalls may increase freshwater flows to coastal areas. This freshwater sits on top of saltwater because it is lighter. This can prevent mixing of oxygen rich surface water with deeper layers where the oxygen has been removed by the decomposition of HABs after they die and sink to the bottom layer. These low oxygen (or hypoxic) zones harm or kill animals that require oxygen to live, including many commercially important species. Higher carbon dioxide levels Algae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially cyanoHABs that can float to the surface of the water and use the increased carbon dioxide. Increased levels of carbon dioxide also increase the acidity of the water, which affects competition among algal species and impacts the organisms that graze on algae. These effects can combine to increase the competitive advantage of HAB species. Changes in rainfall and resulting increases in nutrient loadings A satellite image of a cyanoHAB -taken on October 8, 2022-  in the western basin of Lake Erie. (Image credit: European Space Agency) Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns, increasing both rainfall intensity and the duration of drought. Increased rainfall causes higher nutrient runoff from land into waterbodies fueling HABs like those observed in Lake Erie in 2011 and 2015. If followed by extended drought, waterbodies can retain those nutrients for longer, favoring HAB species that compete better under higher nutrient conditions. Moreover, increases in extreme rainfall and subsequent increases in freshwater flows may flush large loads of nutrients, freshwater HABs and their associated toxins into estuaries and marine areas. As a result, estuarine and marine waters may be at greater risk of developing HABs or seeing an exacerbation of existing HABs. Sea level rise Scientists predict that sea level could rise one meter by the year 2100. This would increase the area of shallow, stable coastal waters that provide more favorable conditions for HABs. Coastal upwelling Coastal upwelling occurs when wind pushes warm, surface water offshore and deep, nutrient rich waters rise to replace it. Climate change is expected to alter the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling. Along the west coast of the United States, excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms, including HABs, especially when combined with increased runoff of nutrient pollution from the land.

(Photo/iStock.) Share Source Alert Q&A: Toxic algae, warming waters imperil marine life on U.S. coasts In Southern California, toxic algae blooms are killing hundreds of dolphins and sea lions while record-high ocean temperatures threaten Floridas coral reefs. USC experts weigh in. August 02, 2023 Nina Raffio The images are heart-rending: hundreds of dolphins and sea lions washing up along the shores of Southern California, sick and dying from toxic algae poisoning . Photographed earlier this summer, they are the latest reminders that the climate crisis is becoming impossible to ignore. Toxic algae blooms, a recurring natural phenomenon, have long been observed in water off the coast of Southern California. But scientists are increasingly concerned over the frequency and severity of these deadly algal outbreaks. As climate change continues to warm ocean temperatures, these favorable conditions allow harmful algae to proliferate. USC News spoke with David Caron , an expert in biological oceanography who is closely examining the ecological crisis and its potential impact on local marine ecosystems, and Carly Kenkel , at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, who focuses on coral reefs. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin emitted by a type of algae called Pseudo-nitzschia australis , is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of marine animals from Santa Barbara to San Diego. How do toxic algae blooms affect other marine species like fish, shellfish and seabirds? Caron: Beyond marine mammals, sea birds that feed on small fish such as anchovies and sardines are at risk for significant intake of toxins if the planktivorous fish they prey on are consuming toxic algae. Most fish and shellfish appear to possess a reasonable tolerance for domoic acid (although some may be affected), but contaminated fish, particularly filter-feeding shellfish, pose a significant health risk to marine animals  and humans  that might consume them. But not all algal blooms are harmful. Many are beneficial and support aquatic food webs. When those blooms are dominated by algal species that are noxious or toxic, however, they can result in very harmful effects on biota. With rising ocean temperatures attributed to climate change, what changes have you observed in the timing and geographic distribution of toxic algae blooms? Caron: There is growing evidence for shifts in the latitudinal distributions of toxic algae along the U.S. West Coast that appear to be driven by changes in temperature (i.e., a warming ocean). However, overall, temperature plays a secondary role to nutrients in explaining the occurrence of algal blooms in general and toxic blooms in particular. The availability of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and some trace nutrients such as iron is key to understanding the location, frequency and severity of coastal algal blooms, and that extends to toxic blooms in freshwater ecosystems as well. Usually, when one talks about bloom-forming nutrients, the elements nitrogen and phosphorus are most discussed. Those two elements are needed in significant quantities for producing biomass, but generally, they are in the shortest supply for algae in many ecosystems. Thus, nitrogen and phosphorus tend to have a controlling influence on the magnitude of algal blooms. There are natural sources of nutrients, generally arising from the decomposition of dead organic material, but also man-made sources. Sewage, agricultural and domestic animal facilities, and urban runoffs tend to have very high concentrations of these elements. In waters where man-made sources are significant relative to natural sources, they can lead to or augment algal blooms. The Florida Keys reef tract, pictured here, has not experienced temperatures this extreme in at least 40 years. (Photo/iStock.) Why are coral reefs crucial for ecosystems worldwide? Kenkel: Corals are the foundation of tropical reef ecosystems. Reefs are incredibly biodiverse  like rainforests of the sea. They are home to 25% of all marine species. But they also play several other roles. They act as a natural breakwater and can prevent erosion and waves and are a major source of income from tourism and livelihoods around the world through subsistence fishing. Through your research, have you noticed any recent changes or patterns in coral reefs, or any other notable developments that can give us insights into the current state of these delicate ecosystems? Kenkel: Right now, the Caribbean is experiencing an unprecedented heat wave. Were seeing signs of major coral stress everywhere from Florida to Belize to the eastern tropical Pacific. The Florida Keys reef tract  the third largest barrier reef in the world  has not experienced temperatures this extreme in at least 40 years. The effects are particularly bad in the lower Florida Keys, where we do most of our research. Just this week, we had to mobilize to sample a long-term field transplant experiment early. The experiment was originally planned to run until next October, but the corals are unlikely to survive until then. Its fascinating how coral, an almost universally beloved symbol, resonates with people and inspires action. What is it about coral that makes it so effective in conveying the urgency of climate change? Kenkel: I think its really the reef ecosystems that inspire. While the coral itself is beautiful, my sense is that its the diverse array of fish and other animals that inhabit the reefs that truly bring the system to life. I think its all that diversity, together, that brings joy and inspires action . Climate change is a global problem, and were seeing these extreme heat events because of how much carbon dioxide is currently in our atmosphere. Every bit helps  taking public transit, buying locally, turning up your air conditioning just a few degrees, and, for those who can afford it, opting for clean-air or all-electric vehicles and installing solar panels and battery storage systems that will reduce your carbon footprint.

A team of Environmental Protection Agency scientists are splashing around in wader suits. Some wear elbow-length gloves. They are studying something sinister — toxic algae. It lurks near the bottom of lakes, streams and even big rivers. “Do you think we got everything?” asked Lil Herger, with the EPA. “I have the pitcher. We’re going to blend up here though right?” responded EPA scientist Rochelle Labiosa. Toxic blooms of blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) are developing in many American lakes, rivers and streams. The toxins can poison dogs and cattle — and sicken people. Now, the EPA is working to develop better tools and methods to sample hard-to-track toxins — and they’re starting their work on the Columbia River in Richland. Recently, the Benton-Franklin health district said at least two dogs died after being at the Columbia River. EPA scientist Jason Pappani scrapes a measured area inside a loop with a toothbrush and then rinses the loose algae into a container for analysis back at a lab.

She was in eastern Washington, leading an EPA team grappling with how toxic algae is increasing on river bottoms — creating toxins that flow downstream; toxins that sometimes eddy and kill. “The benthic harmful cyanobacteria are an emerging issue across the nation,” Labiosa said. “It started coming up more and more. So, when we have a complicated issue like this, that’s when we conduct these research projects.” Across the nation Toxic algae was found this summer in major rivers like the Columbia near Richland, the Snake River and in Oregon's Willamette in Portland. Some of Labiosa's EPA colleagues are tracking toxic algae across the nation: at Escalante National Monument in Utah, the Shenandoah River in Virginia and the American River in California. At the Columbia’s edge, the scientists carried white tiles and a long, rolled-up tape measure. The team created a grid, dropping the tiles about every six feet. “Then, we’re going to take a view of each point with a bathyscope and see how much cover there is,” Labiosa said. “How much algae is adhering to the rocks or to the bottom.” A bathyscope is a sort of awkward, hand-held periscope to see to the bottom of the river. The EPA is sorting out which method can best predict toxic algae growing on the bottom. With a warming climate, even more potentially-deadly algae is expected. “Our goal is to really compare these methods and see if they hold for different types of stream reaches and see what might be an optimal set of methods to apply,” Labiosa said. In a nearby park picnic shed, Jason Pappani, another EPA scientist, had his head bent down, intensely focusing. “Normally I’d be making a lot of cuss words right now,” Pappani says, awkwardly juggling a rock in hand, along with a ring and toothbrush. “So this is just scraping the algae off the rock, we’ve got a known area with this plastic ring. It’s just a toothbrush then rinsing it into the bottle with some river water,” said Pappani. After collection, the samples in vials are flown in big coolers to Cincinnati, Ohio, and other EPA labs across the country, for testing. Jason Pappani stretches a tape measure out into the Columbia River at Leslie Groves Park to grid the shoreline and shallow river for scientific algae measurements.

Two other federal agencies, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Geological Survey, are also getting more intense about studying the Columbia River. The Army Corps has launched a study above Chief Joseph Dam, at Rufus Woods Lake on the river. The Corps took samples bi-weekly from June through September to study cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins, the toxins made by algae. So far, the Corps has determined the toxic algae is benthic, or bottom dwelling. It's regularly producing anatoxin-a in quantities that exceed state guidelines . “Rufus Woods Lake has experienced recurring harmful algal blooms since 2010,” the Corps said in an email statement. “[Rufus Woods Lake] is one of three lakes in Washington State known to have recurring concentrations of the cyanotoxin, anatoxin-a, that historically exceed the state guideline of 1 µg/l [microgram per liter].” The USGS is monitoring a probe about 5 miles north of Richland, in Franklin County. The probe can measure water turbidity, pH, temperature, algae biomass, chlorophyll, conductivity and even light absorption to detect the cyanobacteria pigment phycocyanin … all in real time. The river probe is 30 pounds and looks like a heavy chuck of pipe. It sends data straight up to a satellite and relays it to the web. The goal is to ultimately develop predictive tools to alert cities and counties when highly toxic algae events may be coming. And to develop a history of water chemical and physical parameters that indicate when high algal levels are present. The USGS is helping locals look at harmful algae blooms across the country, using some federal matching funds with local agencies. “So far, local habitats and weed beds around my sensor are really disproportionately important,” said Patrick Moran, a USGS biologist based in Tacoma. “We’re trying to sort out to what degree it’s measuring the weed bed right next to the sensor and to what degree it’s sensing the entire river. That’s really what we are wrestling with right now.” The USGS is trying to install a second probe — near the confluence of the Columbia and Yakima rivers, downstream of Richland. USGS is also trying to figure out the algae problem from a distance. “A couple people in our office are downloading satellite imagery, to see if we can see from satellites early detections of growth,” Moran said. Still, with all these federal and regional studies on the Columbia River, Jim Coleman, with the Benton-Franklin Health District, says it’s been difficult to coordinate all the findings and make recommendations. “A lot of us are working on this,” he says. “Everyone has a little bit of the data.” A sonde measures water properties like the concentration of dissolved oxygen, temperature and salinity near the Columbia River in Richland. Courtesy of Rajah Bose Where it lurks, and the signs With the warm, fall weather, many are still using and swimming in the Columbia River in the Tri-Cities, despite posted signs and warnings about the toxic algae that can kill animals and sicken people. Benton-Franklin Health District in the Tri-Cities is asking people to take precautions, ideally keeping children and pets out of the river water. Areas of concern this summer have included: Howard Amon Park swim beach, Wade Park, Leslie Groves Park and Columbia Point Marina Park. Now restrictions are just on Howard Amon Park. Of increased concern is swimming and fishing docks in the Columbia, said Coleman. “There are various locations where the river current, and Howard Amon Park is a prime example of it, there’s a huge eddy out in the river,” Coleman said. “And whatever is floating in the river gets sucked into the shoreline. The current flows kind of upstream, and if there is a dock or another structure protruding out into the water, then a lot of the solids that are floating on the surface will accumulate at these docks.” That, he says, is hazardous because those solids and the water near them have tested higher in toxin levels consistently in the lab this year. Especially if the solids are lapped up by dogs, or played with by children, it could cause sickness or death, Coleman said. Animals that are exposed to toxic algae may experience weakness, staggering, difficulty breathing and convulsions. In people, signs could include numbness of the lips, tingling in the fingers and toes and dizziness. Toxic algae can be found at high levels even during the winter. So, Labiosa said, when in doubt — stay out.

      To submit a letter to the editor for publication, write to letters@nytimes.com . It’s Toxic Slime Time on Florida’s Lake Okeechobee July 9, 2023 Share full article 263 Huge green blooms are threatening wildlife, pets, people and cities. And algae season is only getting started. Writer Dan Egan and photographer Josh Ritchie reported from Okeechobee’s shores, dodging the lake’s noxious fumes to understand the crisis and its costs. July 9, 2023 For thousands of years, Lake Okeechobee pumped life into Florida’s swampy interior. Summer rains swelled the shallow inland sea, creating seasonal overflows that sustained the Everglades and its alligators, panthers, spoonbills and snail kites. But a vast re-engineering over the past century has transformed Okeechobee into something life-threatening as much as life-giving. Toxic algal blooms now regularly infest much of its 730-square-mile surface during the summer, producing fumes and waterborne poisons potent enough to kill pets that splash in the contaminated waters, or send their owners to the doctor from inhaling the toxins. The Okeechobee mess, caused mainly by phosphorus-based agricultural fertilizers, festered out of the public consciousness for decades. But in recent summers the problem has become more dire. Climate change is making storms and rainfall more intense and less predictable, and last fall Hurricane Ian stirred up so much phosphorus that this summer is expected to be particularly bad. Things get further complicated when lake levels climb so high that contaminated water must be released into canals — toward coastal cities like Fort Myers and Stuart — to protect the structural integrity of the 143-mile-long dike holding back the lake. The coming weeks will offer a serious test. Lake Okeechobee 10 miles Lake Okeechobee 5 miles Lake Okeechobee 5 miles Algal bloom extent on June 12 Source: Satellite image by Landsat By Leanne Abraham Rainy season is just starting, but by late June the lake’s level was roughly two feet higher than the United States Army Corps of Engineers would like. While that’s a few feet below the dike’s potential danger zone, history has shown that Okeechobee can swell by that much in less than a month. Adding to the worry: More than half the lake is already suffering algal blooms. And the algae season has months to go. This has people downstream bracing for another summer of sludge. “We’re looking at a bullet in the chamber here,” said Eve Samples, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Everglades. The state and the Army Corps of Engineers are trying to reduce the toxic flows to the coasts with a controversial re-engineering plan that has been decades in the making, including building a new lake from scratch to contain and decontaminate Okeechobee’s discharges. Star Robinson has watched the lake become perilous. Sunrise over Pahokee and Lake Okeechobee. Yet critics worry it’s still not enough, particularly as the world keeps warming. Scientists say hurricanes are getting not only more powerful because of climate change, but also wetter. Ian last year most likely dropped 10 percent more rain than would have been expected in a world without warming, researchers have said . Star Robinson, 55, grew up playing in and around Okeechobee. But in recent years her relationship with the lake has soured. On a morning jog in the city of Pahokee a few weeks ago, she kept at least 100 yards from the shoreline, and with good reason. Any closer and she risked choking on the lake’s lung-burning fumes. The only activity near the water’s edge? A cluster of buzzards. “They just love the smell of death and decay,” she said. The vapors come from rotting mats of a type of toxic algae — technically a cyanobacteria — that thrives in Okeechobee’s tea-warm water and feasts on rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the phosphorus-rich fertilizer and manure that wash off cropland and into the lake.

There are also concerns that long-term exposure could lead to organ damage and the risk of certain neurological disorders. “This has become almost like a permanent condition,” said Gil Smart, executive director of VoteWater, a nonpartisan group pushing for a more ambitious fix. “It’s like you have spring, you have summer, and you have algae bloom season,” he said. “Like clockwork.” Similar outbreaks have struck lakes elsewhere, including Lake Champlain, Lake Erie and Lake Tahoe. But Okeechobee is different. It is warm, flat and shallow as a backyard pool — making it more like a supersize petri dish than the wellspring of the Everglades. Ms. Robinson, the jogger, said she knows how to fix a lake that has “gone to hell.” “Stop the polluting,” she said. “That’s it. That’s the solution.” It’s not likely to happen anytime soon. Old dike, new hope The Herbert Hoover Dike, a grassy berm protecting lives and livelihoods. The crisis was borne of decisions starting a century ago to tame the lake by holding back its seasonal overflows in order to drain swamps, creating rich farmland. That has transformed southern Florida into one of the most important sugar-cane-producing regions in the world. It came at a heavy cost. Disaster struck in 1926, when a hurricane collapsed part of the dike, drowning hundreds of people. The dike was patched, but two years later it happened again, this time killing thousands. By the 1960s the Army Corps of Engineers proclaimed it had finally controlled the lake with what is now called the Herbert Hoover Dike, a mound of sand, rock and seashells rising a couple of stories above the table-flat landscape. Since the dike severed the lake’s natural flow into the Everglades, the corps now operates canals to carry much of the outflows eastward to the city of Stuart on the Atlantic coast, and west to Fort Myers on the Gulf Coast. For decades, the canals carried away lake water. Then, the algae came. The aftermath of the 1928 hurricane, which killed thousands of people. Roy Senff, Everett Collection Inc., via Alamy Rehabilitating the Herbert Hoover Dike in 1968. U.S.D.A.-A.R.S. Canal Point Sugarcane Field Station About a decade ago, Okeechobee’s outflows began triggering intense downstream algae outbreaks as green as anything Sherwin-Williams might concoct. The coastal impact was particularly bad in 2013, 2016 and 2018, causing beach closures, business shutdowns and even some residential evacuations. (This is different from red tide, another type of toxic algal bloom.) The releases were necessary because an old fear had returned. Engineers realized a few decades ago that Hoover Dike, notoriously leaky, was in danger of collapsing once again if water levels climbed too high. Today, tens of thousands of people live in Okeechobee’s flood path. An 18-year, $1.5 billion dike-fortification project was completed last January. That probably means fewer algae releases toward Fort Myers and Stuart. But nobody thinks Okeechobee’s problems are solved. Not only does climate change increase the risk of heavier rain in the future, but water can already flow into Okeechobee about six times faster than the canals can carry it away. That’s why high lake levels so early in the rainy season are worrisome. In the mid-2000s, for example, a particularly rainy period raised Okeechobee’s level by about four feet in just a month. The Army Corps of Engineers said it is doing its best to protect the ecological health of the peninsula, the people who live downstream and the farmers. “While I can’t promise that there won’t be high releases later this year due to the inherent uncertainty of Mother Nature, we will do our best to avoid them, if possible,” Col. James Booth of the corps said in June. A Manhattan-size project Re-engineering the lake created a sugar cane kingdom. This winter the corps moved ahead with a Manhattan-size reservoir and wetlands complex. A decade or so from now, a 37-foot-high wall — holding back the new lake — will tower over sugar cane country. The idea is that the reservoir will capture at least some of Okeechobee’s toxic outflows instead of sending them to the coasts. The 10,500-acre reservoir and the recently completed 6,500-acre artificial wetlands, designed to absorb phosphorus, are the centerpiece of a growing system of canals, gates, pumps and engineered wetlands built to clean the outflows so they can once again drift south into the Everglades as well as provide drinking water to booming South Florida. The two projects will cost roughly $4 billion. During a recent visit to the site, Tim Harper, an engineer with the South Florida Water Management District, parked his pickup and asked his passengers to take in the endless sea of sugar cane that will one day be lake bottom. “Now, imagine 23 feet of water above you,” he said, “essentially for as far as the eye can see.” It’s a difficult picture to conjure. Equally challenging to grasp is the idea that the whole new lake, as big as it sounds, will fill to capacity if only six inches of Lake Okeechobee is sent its way. An earlier proposal for a 60,000-acre system was scuttled when agricultural operators, primarily sugar cane growers, objected. Obtaining the land through eminent domain wasn’t an option after the Florida Legislature in 2017 prohibited allowing the state to force a sale. Fields of sugar cane dominate the landscape south of Lake Okeechobee. The lock and dam that feed the canal, which sometimes carries toxins toward Stuart. Scaling back the reservoir has required drastically increasing its depth. The corps says it will still be big and stout enough to trap and treat a significant amount of the contaminated waters. The project has the support of President Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential hopeful. Many conservationists welcomed the decision to build a smaller reservoir as a major step in the right direction. “No project will play a bigger role in reducing algae-causing discharges from Lake Okeechobee,” said the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation, Eric Eikenberg. Others are skeptical. Bill Mitsch, retired director of the Everglades Wetland Research Park at Florida Gulf Coast University, sees the project as too small. He worries it may even result in harm to the Everglades if the phosphorus-absorbing wetlands don’t work as well as predicted. “There is just not enough capacity,” he said. Ms. Samples, of the Friends of the Everglades, shares that concern. “Florida has this century-long history of trying to out-engineer Mother Nature and having it backfire, and it really feels like we’re repeating the mistakes of our past,” she said. A new normal A late June bloom, lapping the shore. June 11 was a Sunday — a boat day — near Stuart on the coast. A flotilla of Floridians landed on a sandbank a couple of miles offshore and soaked up sun and drinks in thigh-deep waters. Some talked about how thrilled they were to see native seagrass making a comeback since it was ravaged five summers ago by Okeechobee toxic outflows. The grasses provide fish habitat as well as essential food for beloved manatees, which are in such a desperate condition that government crews have taken to feeding them romaine lettuce . Stefani Hughes, a real estate agent, remembered 2018’s outflows for the damage not just to the ecology, but to the economy as well. “I personally lost a $1 million sale watching the green plume come in,” she said. Conservationists say state rules to control the flow of phosphorus from agricultural lands, by far the largest source of the pollutant, have long been poorly enforced. Yet even if fertilizer runoff stopped tomorrow, the algae threat would persist for decades or more because there is already so much phosphorus tied up in cropland soils and lake sediment. This is one reason the path forward has included building the new reservoir and investing in phosphorus-catching artificial wetlands. But for the moment, people like Mr. Smart of VoteWater aren’t worried about the next decade. They’re worried about the next several weeks. “Everybody keeps their fingers crossed that we won’t have a rainy summer, and that the toxins that are in the lake, stay in the lake,” he said.

        12:13 PM EDT, Fri June 30, 2023 Link Copied! Video Ad Feedback Sea animals suffer as 200-mile toxic algae bloom spreads 04:16 - Source: CNN CNN — The scene is unsettling: hundreds of sea lions and dolphins are sprawled across the beaches in Southern California, either dead or sick and exhibiting abnormal behavior. Officials have received more than 1,000 calls in recent weeks from beachgoers, tourists and residents reporting sick, dying and dead sea mammals washed ashore from Santa Barbara to San Diego County, amid a growing toxic algal bloom in the waters off the coast. The wave of dead or sick animals is “one of the largest in memory,” Justin Greenman, a stranding coordinator with NOAA Fisheries, told CNN. “It’s completely overwhelming.” And, Greenman said, it doesn’t appear to be ending any time soon. Marine-life experts believe the harmful algal bloom is to blame, though they are waiting on test results to confirm it. The algae, Pseudo-nitzschia , produces a neurotoxin called domoic acid, which can be poisonous to seabirds and fish once ingested. It can then travel across the food chain to larger marine animals like dolphins, sea lions and even humans.

(Photo by Owen Humphreys/PA Images via Getty Images) Owen Humphreys/PA Images/Getty Images The North Atlantic is experiencing a 'totally unprecedented' marine heat wave Like dolphins and sea lions, humans can get sick from domoic acid if they eat contaminated food, although seafood is tested for this toxin to prevent it from reaching dinner tables. The California Department Of Health specifically warned against eating “sport-harvested mussels, clams or scallops from Santa Barbara County” after high-levels of the toxin were detected there. Ruth Dover, a co-founder and managing director of Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute , which has been fielding hundreds of calls about the strandings, said they have responded to more than 100 dead sea lions and 300 live sea lions exhibiting signs of ingesting domoic acid in Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The death toll for dolphins is now up to 100, the group said, which Greenman describes as unusual – particularly in how this bloom appears to be affecting species that typically dwell far from the shore. “It’s like the waves of a tsunami keep washing over our local beaches with even more sea lions and dolphins suffering from domoic acid,” Dover told CNN. “We thought last year’s domoic acid event affecting Santa Barbara and Ventura was tragic, but this year’s event is even more horrific.” “Our beautiful beaches are littered with sick, dying and deceased sea lions and dolphins,” she said. Tissue samples have been taken for testing to confirm that the domoic acid-producing algae is behind the crisis. But Michael Milstein a spokesperson for NOAA Fisheries, told CNN that the situation has “all the hallmarks of an algal bloom.” People wear protective masks as the Roosevelt Island Tram crosses the East River while haze and smoke from the Canadian wildfires shroud the Manhattan skyline in the Queens Borough New York City, on June 7. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters/FILE Four alarming charts that show just how extreme the climate is right now Some harmful algal blooms thrive in warm water – making them more of a concern as ocean temperatures climb. But in other cases, like the ongoing bloom in California, it is driven less by water temperatures and more by strong coastal upwelling, which provides more nutrients that feed the algae. “The water in that area is not especially warm right now, as it was during a similar event last year,” Milstein said. “That does not necessarily mean there is no climate connection, because there remains some possibility that climate change may favor more toxic algae, or influence ocean chemistry in ways that favor domoic acid production.” This type of phytoplankton can bloom fast when there are changes to the amount of light and nutrients available. Harmful algal blooms in Southern California have happened in the past , but experts say they have increased in frequency and severity in recent decades, noting that a warming planet may play a role in this. “It’s just scary, because you normally see the ocean as this source of life, and the idea that we have a poisonous ocean as a result of climate change and human activity is just devastating,” Geoff Shester, California director and senior scientist with Oceana told CNN. “We can warn consumers, but there is no warning that’s going to tell the dolphins and sea lions to avoid these fish.” Rescuers are ‘physically tired and emotionally drained’ The California algal bloom began late in May. But on June 8, Dover said the group started getting calls, online reports, emails and texts “at an overwhelming rate.” At some points, they were receiving up to 60 reports an hour of marine mammals in distress. That’s more than 300 reports in a day, and a gargantuan task for a small, nonprofit organization made mostly of volunteers.

A very wet winter has left California's reservoirs looking healthier than they have for years, as near-record rainfall put a big dent in a lengthy drought. Josh Edelson/AFP/Getty Images California's Lake Oroville is back at 100% capacity after being hit hard by yearslong drought “It is impossible for our small nonprofit organization to handle this unprecedented volume,” Dover said. “There are cases we cannot get to and it’s not because we don’t care. It’s because there are too many animals stranding with domoic acid for us to physically respond to in a day.” When stranding reports come in, they dispatch the next available volunteer to drive to the site, walk the beach, find the animal and conduct a physical assessment, which includes photo and video documentation and recording exact geolocation as well as tide and beach conditions. Carrying and transporting the animals that are still alive is another physical struggle that requires up to six volunteers, depending on the animal’s size, as well as some equipment and gear, according to Dover. Once they’ve been transported, the rescued animals receive immediate treatment, which includes intense hydration to flush the toxin out of their systems, anti-seizure medication and feeding them with fish that does not contain domoic acid. “Our team members are physically tired and emotionally drained,” Dover said. “It is really difficult to watch an animal suffering from domoic acid, and we want to help each and every one of them.” loonathebrave/TMX Colorado amphitheater hail storm injures nearly 100 ahead of planned Louis Tomlinson concert Mortality rates with adult sea lions have been significant, Dover said. And despite their treatment, many are dying either at the beach or even during transport to their facility for care. The mammals are experiencing multiple grand mal seizures and brain damage from the toxin, she said. Dover said while they are still rescuing adult sea lions, they are trying to focus their limited manpower on rescuing young animals that may have ingested less of the toxin-laced fish. Beyond Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, NOAA’s Greenman said the impacts of the algae are expanding to Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. Dover’s group is just one of the many organizations that is a member of the Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Network, which is overseen by NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries. “[The groups] do receive some federal funding, but that’s really a small drop in the bucket,” Greenman said. “But we’ve got a lot of people who’ve devoted so much of their time and their hearts, and it’s started to take its toll.” Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Ad Feedback Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Live TV Listen Watch US Crime + Justice World Africa Americas Asia Australia China Europe India Middle East United Kingdom Politics SCOTUS Congress Facts First 2024 Elections Business Tech Media Calculators Videos Markets Pre-markets After-Hours Fear & Greed Investing Markets Now Before the Bell Nightcap Opinion Political Op-Eds Social Commentary Health Life, But Better Fitness Food Sleep Mindfulness Relationships Entertainment Movies Television Celebrity Tech Innovate Foreseeable Future Mission: Ahead Work Transformed Innovative Cities Style Arts Design Fashion Architecture Luxury Beauty Video Travel Destinations Food & Drink Stay News Videos Sports Pro Football College Football Basketball Baseball Soccer Olympics Hockey Watch Live TV CNN Headlines CNN Shorts Shows A-Z CNN10 CNN Max CNN TV Schedules Listen CNN 5 Things Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta The Assignment with Audie Cornish One Thing Tug of War CNN Political Briefing The Axe Files All There Is with Anderson Cooper All CNN Audio podcasts CNN Underscored Electronics Fashion Beauty Health & Fitness Home Reviews Deals Money Gifts Travel Outdoors Pets CNN Store Coupons About CNN Coupons Frequently Asked Questions Top 20 Shops Categories Science Space Life Unearthed Climate Solutions Weather Video Ukraine-Russia War Israel-Hamas War About CNN Photos Investigations CNN Profiles CNN Leadership CNN Newsletters Work for CNN US Watch Listen Live TV Follow CNN Sign in My Account Settings Topics You Follow Sign Out Your CNN account Sign in to your CNN account Terms of Use Privacy Policy Ad Choices Accessibility & CC About Newsletters Transcripts © 2024 Cable News Network.

Get more news Live on Print June 27, 2023, 11:35 AM UTC By Dennis Romero Visitors seeking lighthearted views of sea life along Southern California's coastline are instead coming upon marine mammals taking their final breaths. As peak beach season and the Fourth of July holiday approach, California officials and experts are warning about an unprecedented die-off of sea lions. The likely cause, domoic acid from an offshore algae bloom, is not unusual. But the breadth of the poisoning, which can cause brain damage, seizures and death in sea lions, is rare, experts say. A sea lion rests on Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco in 2013. Don Emmert / AFP via Getty Images file John Warner, the CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center, a nonprofit rescue organization that serves Los Angeles County, said the facility was at capacity, with nearly 70 sea lions on site. Another 70 along the Los Angeles coast still needed rescuing, he said. ""From our experience in L.A. County, this is one of the worst years in recent memory,"" Warner said. The Los Angeles Unified School District was expected to announce Tuesday that it's giving the Marine Mammal Care Center, which operates on district property, additional space, a rescue tank and plumbing for the tank. Tourists and visitors, meanwhile, are witnessing poisoned sea lion mothers giving birth to stillborn pups, Warner said. ""Every popular beach you can name has animals seizing right now,"" he said, ""right in front of everyone who's on vacation or enjoying the nice weather."" Points north, including Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, are registering worse numbers, with the Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute in Santa Barbara fielding reports of 200 sick or dead marine mammals every day, according to a NOAA Fisheries report on the bloom. “I have never seen anything this intense in terms of the numbers of animals in my 20 years of responding to strandings in this area,” Michelle Berman Kowalewski, the founder and director of the Channel Islands Cetacean Research Unit in Santa Barbara, said in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration article. The offending bloom has been traced to the waters off Central California and off the northern reaches of Southern California, where warm water and cooler water coming up from the depths, called upwelling, can create ideal conditions for algae blooms. Scientists believe the blooms, which are becoming almost annual affairs, are also boosted by urban runoff that includes farm fertilizer and human waste. The increasing frequency of the blooms can also be correlated to global warming, as well as to the warmer, wetter climes of El Niño, the weather phenomenon present and expected to strengthen by winter. State health officials this month warned against eating sport-harvested mussels, clams or scallops from Santa Barbara County. The seafood may contain domoic acid , which they say can cause gastrointestinal illness or even trigger trouble breathing, coma or death. Sick sea lions can be treated if the domoic acid poisoning is diagnosed early, SeaWorld San Diego veterinarian Kelsey Herrick said. Toxins can be flushed out with liquids and medication, she said, but some animals will suffer irreversible brain damage. The marine mammals absorb domoic acid not directly but rather through fish that eat the algae, Herrick said. The San Diego coast is at the trailing end of the bloom's impacts, but SeaWorld's marine life rescue team has rescued seven sea lions and a dolphin believed to be suffering from the poisoning this month, she said. Experts warn tourists to stay away from marine mammals in any situation, but especially if they seem to have having seizures or they vomit, behave aggressively or miscarry. Herrick said the odd behavior of San Diego's late Freeway the sea lion , who made headlines after he scoped out eateries, scooted down a freeway and waddled into an urban creek, can now be explained by domoic acid poisoning. A postmortem exam showed brain damage consistent with the poisoning, she said. ""We find them showing up in weird places — on roads, on private property, in someone's backyard,"" Herrick said. ""Unfortunately it's very abnormal."" Dennis Romero Dennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital. Steve Patterson contributed .

Credit: ERIKA TAYLOR, Voice of OC. As the heat wave reaches Southern California for summertime, more Orange County residents are heading for the beaches. But rising temperatures are also pushing other creatures onto local beaches: sick and sometimes aggressive sea lions. Off the California coast, toxic algae blooms — a rapid increase in harmful algae caused by a combination of water runoff and rising temperatures — are poisoning sea lions and dolphins, causing stranded marine animals onto local beaches. Dozens of sea lions affected by the toxic algae have been seen attacking beachgoers or washing up dead on shore due to the poisonous blooms, which produce a harmful domoic acid neurotoxin. The algae, which thrives in warmer climates, cause these mammals to undergo seizures and brain injuries as a result of ingesting the toxin during this massive bloom event up and down the coastline. Sea lions and dolphins usually get infected by this algae when they consume fish that have come into contact with the domoic acid. The Pacific Marine Mammal Center is a nonprofit that rescues stranded sea lion on Orange County beaches and releases them back into the wild after they’ve recovered from their ailments, typically malnutrition or dehydration. The capacity for the center’s hospital in Laguna Beach is filling while more of these mammals wash up on beaches and the rescue team is sent to transport them to its facility. We see local news is important to you. Support it with a donation today. Alissa Deming, director of clinical medicine at the center, said right now is the worst they’ve ever seen marine mammals affected by this algae. “In any given year, we would probably have about 10 to 15 adult animals,” Deming said in a phone interview earlier this month. “During this event, we have responded to over 100 animals.” Dr. Alissa Deming, Director of Clinical Medicine, at the Pacific Marine Mammal Center on July 26, 2023. Deming provides medical care to all marine mammals that strand alive on Orange County’s beaches, including the sea lions seen behind her. Credit: ERIKA TAYLOR, Voice of OC. The problem got so bad that the center had to build four extra pens in an emergency expansion to their animal hospital earlier this summer just to accommodate the stranded sea lions in Orange County. “​It was very expensive for us — it was not cheap,” Deming said. “This whole bloom has completely blown our budget.” Last year, the Pacific Marine Mammal Center wrote a budget of $5 million, according to chief executive officer Glenn Gray. Gray said their work would not be possible without their 250 active volunteers, many of which are working 18-hour days due to the bloom.

Animals with domoic acid poisoning receive anti-seizure and anti-inflammatory medication for about five days. After around two weeks of observation, the mammals are released back to the sea if the treatment is successful. The seizures from this toxic algae can cause permanent brain damage or death if not treated in time. Deming said about a third of the sea lions called into the center have already died. If the animals don’t respond well to treatments, they could be left permanently epileptic and are usually euthanized.

When sea lions and other marine mammals in the facility are deemed healthy, they are released back to nature. Earlier this month, the center released two young sea lions who had made a full recovery. Gray encourages people to come to the center to learn more about the connections between marine mammals and humans. “People need to come to grips with the idea that we are not being friendly to the ocean,” Gray said. “The ocean is 70% of our home, and we need to take better care of it. We are seeing the first-hand effects of climate change on our shores.” The center continues to welcome visitors despite being overwhelmed by the toxic algae bloom.

Jill Andersen visited the center with her two grandchildren earlier this month to teach them more about the ocean. “My grandchildren love to visit the center and see the animals — it’s one of our fun adventures together,” Anderson said. Although she had not seen any marine mammals on the beaches herself, she said she was aware of what was happening on Orange County’s coast. “It’s really unfortunate what is happening to them now.” Release team members unload the sea lion yearlings for release at Aliso Creek Beach on July 26, 2023.

Experts say that the natural algae blooms are starting earlier than ever, and lasting even longer, for a number of reasons, including climate change that increases water temperatures, carbon dioxide and UV light. Additionally, several unusually wet winters have filled local reservoirs to historic levels, helping stir up nutrients that were previously settled at the bottom. So far, bodies of water like Lake Elsinore, Puddingstone Lake in San Dimas, Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County and Diamond Valley Lake near Hemet have all had cyanobacteria detected in their waters, prompting a slew of warnings for residents and visitors. The naturally occurring blue-green algae can cause a slew of distressing symptoms, including mouth ulcers, vomiting and diarrhea. It can be especially dangerous for pets since they tend to drink the water and lick their wet fur afterward. In Lake Elsinore on Friday, dead fish could be seen floating in the scum on the outskirts of the water, just months after city officials boasted of cleaner waters and record water levels. ""February and March and even April, the lake was crystal clear,"" said Adam Gufarotti, a spokesperson for the city. ""We were seeing visibility of over 16 feet, which is amazing, but as the temps warm up, we get more and more algae."" Even with the new warnings, that advise people to remain away from the water because of the potential danger, Lake Elsinore is urging people to visit their area as they continue to make big changes to keep the destination safe. They invested in a $2 million dollar device called a nano-bubbler, that infuses the lake with oxygen. The water is also routinely treated with algaecide and tested regularly out of an abundance of caution. Still, some visitors are being cautious about entering the water. ""I might go out in a boat, but I don't think I'm gonna be taking a dip,"" said Rick Stark. A full list of water warnings in California can be found here .

The state has detected red tide in Texas coastal waters for the first time since 2018. Credit: Courtesy of TPWD Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Toxic algae blooms known as red tide have been detected in multiple sections of the Texas Gulf Coast including the upper coast around Galveston Bay and the lower Laguna Madre in the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said. It’s the first time Texas has seen a red tide since 2018 , when it affected the upper and middle parts of the state’s coast. Red tide typically starts in late summer or early fall. Parks and Wildlife officials first noticed it in Freeport, south of Houston, on Sept. 3. The state agency estimates that at least two fish kills have been associated with red tide, one on Surfside-Quintana beaches near Freeport and another between Sargent Beach and Matagorda Beach last week. Red tide is caused when colonies of microalgae rapidly grow and produce toxins that can make people, fish and other sea creatures sick. When red tide algae, which occur naturally in the Gulf’s waters, reproduce in mass quantities in one location, they form “blooms,” which are visible as discolored patches of water often reddish in color. People who swim in water with a high concentration of red tide can experience eye, nose and throat irritation, as well as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The toxins can become airborne and people can breathe them in. Red tide also releases a toxin that can affect the central nervous system of fish, paralyzing them so they cannot breathe. This often leads to dead fish washing up on Gulf beaches — especially in Florida, where it happens nearly every summer. Red tides in Texas happen less often and don't last very long, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. TPWD said their staff is keeping an eye on the situation and working with other groups including NOAA to monitor beach conditions. Lerrin Johnson, a TPWD spokesperson, said it’s difficult to predict how long the red tide will last in Texas, adding that long periods without rainfall, like most of Texas has experienced this year, can drive algal blooms and, specifically, red tide. The agency suspects the red tide near Freeport and Galveston Bay might have caused fish to die in places like San Luis Pass and Surfside Beach and Quintana Beach. The Brazoria County parks department said staff checking beach conditions reported respiratory symptoms caused by discolored water and scattered dead fish at Quintana Beach and Follet's Island Beach. County officials are asking people to stay off beaches for safety. Red tide has also been detected in the lower Laguna Madre area at Good Hope Circle Beach and the Gulf Beach in Cameron County.

HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (KABC) -- The largest algae bloom on record is taking place off California's central and southern coast, and over the last few weeks it has sickened and killed hundreds of sea lions and dolphins. ""The size of this one again and the numbers of animals that are coming ashore is large,"" said Justin Viezbicke, California stranding coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. ""Larger than we've seen really in the last, I'd say close to probably 20 years."" Viezbicke said while there is no risk to humans through water contact, sea mammals like sea lions and dolphins are getting sick from suspected domoic acid toxicity, which happens after eating contaminated food. ""It's created this opportunity for this algae to grow, basically, so it's growing and it's gotten to the point where there's enough of it out there,"" Viezbicke said. Viezbicke said it's worked its way through the food chain, resulting in marine mammals eating contaminated fish. Marine Mammal Care Center CEO John Warner said the bloom is causing a large influx of sea lions to be stranded on beaches up and down Southern California coasts. He said they're treating them as fast as they can but an unknown number of sick sea lions remain on the beaches. ""To feel helpless, to be full and know that there's animals in need is probably the worst experience for all of us who work here and are volunteers as well,"" Warner said. Viezbicke urges people to stay away from stranded sea lions because they may be under distress and be aggressive. ""We've had a number of bites that have been reported in Santa Barbara, L.A. and Orange counties,"" he said. ""When these sea lions are affected by this neurotoxin there is definitively an increase chance for harmful interactions between humans and animals."" Beachgoers who see a stranded or dead animal on the beach are encouraged to report it by calling the NOAA at 866-767-6114. Report a correction or typo Copyright © 2024 KABC Television, LLC.

The scientists found that certain combinations of volatile organic compounds released by algae can serve as indicator for microcystin , a toxin produced at varying levels during blooms of cyanobacteria , commonly known as blue-green algae. Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, said OSU’s Kimberly Halsey, who led the study. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Even though the research dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, said Halsey, associate professor of microbiology in the College of Science. She said the study published today in mSystems describes “a very creative new approach that’s better and less expensive than current monitoring methods and also has broader implications.” “This work suggests that VOCs might be used to indicate other important environmental shifts, like the onset of oxygen deficiencies in aquatic systems or domoic acid contamination in coastal ecosystems,” Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. VOCs are any of a number of carbon-containing chemicals with a high tendency to exist in their gaseous state. VOCs released by cyanobacteria seem to reveal the physiological status of the algae during toxic blooms, Halsey said. “One reason VOCs could be such great targets for monitoring is their volatility,” she said. “Ideally we’ll someday be able to sniff the air above the lake with instruments and see which gases are there during cyanobacterial blooms.” Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms ubiquitous in all types of water around the globe. They use sunlight to make their own food and in warm, nutrient-rich environments can quickly multiply, resulting in blooms that spread across the water’s surface. These harmful algal blooms , often abbreviated to HABs, can form at any time of the year but most typically happen between spring and fall. An HAB in 2018 fouled drinking water in Oregon’s capital city of Salem, and in 2007 a national survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found microcystin, a recognized liver toxin and potential liver carcinogen, in one out of every three lakes that were sampled. Annual economic losses attributed to cyanobacterial HABs in the United States alone are conservatively valued at $2-4 billion, say the researchers, who add that the severity and consequences of the blooms are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. “That means we need new and innovative monitoring for cyanobacteria and their toxins,” Halsey said. “It’s super expensive to measure toxins directly, especially when a waterway needs to be sampled and tested weekly over the course of an entire summer.” Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, Halsey said. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Halsey, microbiology graduate student Lindsay Collart and associate professor of statistics Duo Jiang worked with two years of water samples from eight locations on and near Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon. The lake is important for agriculture and recreation, for tribal subsistence and culture, and for fish and wildlife, Halsey notes, but its water quality has declined over the last 50 years from intensive farming and drought. Upper Klamath Lake is one of many Oregon lakes affected by cyanobacterial HABs each year, but not all of the blooms result in toxic levels of microcystin, and the onset and levels of toxin production have been largely unpredictable. “The algae cells are always producing a little bit of microcystin, and it serves a good purpose in the cell – it helps combat stress,” Halsey said. “But the cells can reach a tipping point of over-reliance on microcystin and that’s when levels in the water become toxic.” Analyzing the dissolved gases in the water samples – 227 VOCs in all – the scientists were able to determine subsets of them that were associated with different levels of microcystin in the water. Statistical analysis of the VOC subsets does a better job predicting toxin levels than currently used techniques like assessing water color and measuring cell count, Halsey said. “Now that we know these particular subsets of compounds are predictors of toxicity, maybe we only need to measure those,” she said. Even though the study dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. Halsey said the study also showed that VOCs can be used to paint a general picture of community composition – i.e., the relative abundance of cyanobacteria to other microbes in the system – which she describes as potentially “another piece of the prediction puzzle.” The Oregon State College of Science and the OSU Agricultural Research Foundation supported this research. College of Science About the OSU College of Science: As one of the largest academic units at OSU, the College of Science has seven departments and 12 pre-professional programs.

Tests conducted this week by the river authority detected high toxicity levels in algae taken from three sites on Lake LBJ and three sites on Inks Lake. The concerning levels of toxicity were detected only in the algae itself, not in the lake water, according to a press release . Cyanobacteria or blue-green algae thrives in hot, dry weather, and the algae can produce toxins at all times, said John Hofmann, LCRA executive vice president of Water. His advice is to treat all algae as if it could be toxic. Although the organization hasn't tested lakes Buchanan, Marble Falls or Travis this summer, Hofmann said cyanotoxins are still likely present in those areas of the Highland Lakes. If you see algae in the water, move somewhere else, he said. “As we’ve been saying for years, keep people and pets away from algae in the Highland Lakes,” Hofmann said. LCRA has not received reports of pets becoming ill from the lakes' algae since 2021, when several dogs became sick or died after contact with algae in Lake Travis. “Pet owners need to take this seriously,” Hofmann said. “Dogs will eat algae or lick it off their coats, which can have devastating consequences if the algae is producing toxins.” Careers Staff Directory Accessibility Sitemap Legals Our Ethical Principles Responsible Disclosure Subscription Terms & Conditions Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your Privacy Choices Contact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Promote your Event Licensing & Reprints Austin American-Statesman Store Help Center Subscriber Guide Manage Account Give Feedback Subscribe Today Newsletters Facebook X Instagram eNewspaper Archives Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed.com 10Best LocaliQ Digital Marketing Solutions Events © 2024 www.statesman.com.

It sure has been a fun summer along the Willamette River, but please avoid going into specific areas of the river at this time. Multnomah County reported on Saturday that the toxic algae has spread from the Ross Island Lagoon to Duckworth Dock. It’s also blooming on Sauvie Island. Until further notice, the water can cause serious illness for you and your pets. The following areas do not currently have advisories: Fire House Dock, Sellwood, George Rogers Park. When in doubt, stay out.

Stay cool, stay safe.

An increase of toxic algae has been noticed in our lakes and rivers this summer, particularly in the central North Island. 🏞️

Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, love to grow in warm, calm waters, especially shallow lakes and slow-moving rivers and streams when the weather is hot. ☀️

Blue-green algae play a crucial role in our ecosystem but become a problem in high concentrations because of the toxins they produce. These toxins can be harmful to people and animals.

👀 Keep an eye out for lakes or ponds that are discoloured, cloudy or murky, especially if blue-green in colour or with scum on the water’s surface or edge.

🏞️ In rivers, toxic algae generally form brown or black mats that grow on rocks. There may also be a strong odour.

🐶 Be mindful of the water your pets are swimming in and drinking from and keep an eye out for any warnings in your area.
