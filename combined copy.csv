The water becomes too‚Ä¶ | Instagram","When wastewater from fish farms gets dumped into the ocean or lake, a process called ‚Äòeutrophication' occurs. The water becomes too enriched with nutrients, which leads to excessive plant and algae growth, known as algal blooms. You can see when algae take over because the water turns green or brown or red. Algal blooms are part of nature, and we sometimes see them in Walvis Bay, but they happen a lot more often and more seriously around fish farms. Algal bloom causes low oxygen levels and blocks sunlight, it even clogs fish gills. In short: it kills everything.

You're not alone. To help better‚Ä¶ | Instagram,"Do late-summer algal blooms and AHS Blue-Green Algae advisories on your favourite lake get you down? You're not alone.

To help better understand algal blooms, we are working with the Alberta Lake Management Society(ALMS) and a team of dedicated volunteers at several lakes across the province to collect a variety of important data.

Our role is to track satellite imagery from a few specified Alberta lakes across the summer seasons. These images are being compared to water samples being collected by on-the-ground volunteers at the same date and time the images are taken. The challenge is there can be no clouds in the sky for the images to be taken!

Want to see what these images look like? Check out this map from Pigeon Lake to see how the algal bloom moves around the lake, grows and shrinks, over a summer. Feel free to toggle the different dates you are interested in, and scroll around (link in bio).

Residents and visitors of Clear Lake, California's second-largest freshwater lake, are being urged to use caution when visiting the lake after officials discovered high levels of dangerous cyanotoxins from blue-green algae blooms in the lake. Cyanobacterial algal blooms are dangerous when the toxins in the water reach high concentrations and become harmful to people, pets and marine life. Nearly 300 residents draw water directly from the lake and being told to avoid using the water and even boiling the water will not kill the bacteria.

It‚Äôs common to have heard the terms but knowing how to identify a harmful algal bloom and communicate the harmful effects is way less likely! What blooms are harmful and how do you identify a harmful bloom?

Are you fluent in algae? Know how to identify a bloom or determine if it‚Äôs harmful? Drop your algal knowledge in the comments! üë©‚Äçüî¨üßë‚Äçüî¨

Thankfully for the rest of us, USGS experts Rebecca Gorney, Jennifer Graham, and Jennifer Murphy published a report that can provide some clarity and guidance!

Their recent publication ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòH,‚Äô ‚ÄòA,‚Äô and ‚ÄòB‚Äô of a HAB: A Definitional Framework,‚Äù was featured in the Summer 2023 issue of the North American Lake Management Society‚Äôs LakeLine magazine. #HarmfulAlgalBloom

The publication shines light on the difficulties of a one-size fits all definition for the term harmful algal bloom or HABs. Many algal groups produce blooms but not all are harmful. In the report, experts provide a definitional framework to support and guide communications involving HABs. Additionally, authors compile potential harmful effects of blooms on humans and animals, ecological systems, and the economy by algal group in an easy-to-read infographic.

Dr John Barry says Minister Andrew Muir should alert British and Irish governments and demand help

The money allocated by Stormont to address ecological problems on Lough Neagh ‚Äúwill not touch the sides‚Äù of what is needed, an environmental academic has said.

Last year the Lough was besieged by blooms of blue-green algae, causing vast swathes of thick green substances on its surface.

The crisis resulted from the perfect storm of higher temperatures, prolonged periods of rain and higher nutrient content in the water due to agricultural run-off.

Environment Minister Andrew Muir told the Assembly on Monday that ¬£1.6m had been allocated by the Executive to his department in capital funding and no resource funding for the issues besetting the lough, with officials now looking at other ways to fund the work needed.

Mr Muir said the allocation given to his department was ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù.

He added: ‚ÄúWe need to invest in turning the situation round in Lough Neagh.‚Äù

The minister also told the Assembly he had commissioned scientific research to assess the effect of removing sand from the lough.

Dr John Barry, Professor of Green Political Economy at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, said the amount allocated would not be anywhere near enough to solve the issues.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even going to touch the sides,‚Äù he told the Belfast Telegraph.

‚ÄúThe timescales ‚Äî going on the meeting Save Our Lough had with him last week ‚Äî were in terms of decades.

‚ÄúThere is an American adage ‚Äî a day late and a dollar short ‚Äî but it‚Äôs going to be decades late and a lot of money short to address this.

‚ÄúIt is disappointing; the longer we delay addressing the causes of the problems with the Lough, it‚Äôs going to take longer and cost more.‚Äù    

With warmer temperatures expected in 2024 due to the El Nino phenomenon, Dr Barry said the issues that plagued Lough Neagh last year would be even worse this year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be warmer this year, so it is probably going to be worse than it was last year,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe crisis is not caused by climate change, but climate change means the water is warmer, which causes more energy and therefore the algae blooms increase.

‚ÄúIt is a disaster and there is no sign the government is going to be taking it with any degree of seriousness. This really should be an Executive Office priority, not just for DAERA.‚Äù

Dr Barry said Mr Muir should be alerting the British and Irish governments to the scale of the problem and demanding more money.

‚ÄúI think this is such an emergency and it has been declared as such. This is 40% of our drinking water, the largest freshwater lake in these islands. It is an extraordinary situation,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt he going to the British government and Irish government and saying, ‚ÄòGive us more money‚Äô? That would be evidence that he is really taking this seriously, rather than asking his [Executive] colleagues nicely.

‚ÄúHe has now tasked his officials to go and find a bit of money down the back of a sofa and we all know how that‚Äôs going to work out ‚Äî it‚Äôs not going to be enough.

‚ÄúThis is going to run and run; it‚Äôs going to get considerably worse. We could be looking at irreparable damage to the Lough unless it‚Äôs addressed now.‚Äù    

It comes after the Assembly passed a motion calling for an ‚Äúecological and biodiversity crisis‚Äù to be declared in Northern Ireland.

The motion, tabled by the SDLP opposition, also urged DAERA to bring forward legislation to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency as outlined in the 2020 New Decade, New Approach agreement.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the passing of the motion.

‚ÄúIn the past few days with the spell of hot weather we are already seeing signs of the re-emergence of the toxic algae blooms which wreaked such havoc over the past year, killing wildlife, destroying biodiversity and impacting local businesses,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe reasons for the ecological crisis at the Lough are well-worn, but it is deeply disappointing that we stand here again on the brink of another summer where little has been done to address these issues.

‚ÄúParties have been clear on the need to act to protect the long-term future of the Lough.

‚ÄúOne of the Minister‚Äôs first visits after assuming office was to the Lough, but we need action if we are going to save this precious resource.

‚ÄúProtecting our environment should be a priority for every department and there needs to be ownership of this issue from the entire Executive.

‚ÄúThe SDLP has been calling for an independent Environmental Protection Agency for well over a decade and it was agreed as part of New Decade, New Approach.

‚ÄúWhat we have been doing up until this point clearly isn‚Äôt working and it is our view that an independent body will give us the best chance of safeguarding our natural resources like Lough Neagh.‚Äù",14 May 2024 04:55:28,reddit

My dog enjoys playing in water. I am too lazy esp in winter/spring to wash him after every water adventure. But yes he is spoiled and sleeps on my bed, so some concern.

I am wondering how everyone handles figuring out if a body of water is acceptable for recreational use for themselves or dogs.

I am thinking mainly outside Seattle city limits to lakes and rivers in the area even into the back country. Can I assume lakes out in NF are basically clean enough for recreation (yes I know filter for drinking)?

I know there is toxic algae to watch for, but what about fecal coliforms or other dangers? I recently randomly discovered the river near Carnation that he liked to play in is a known fecal coliform hot spot, so no more of that park.

So far I have gone with the solution to pollution is dilution, and generally decide Puget Sound and Lake WA are probably ok. But after that IDK.

113,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowellMA/comments/1cmk95j/conservation_land/,Conservation land,"Are there steps someone could take to try and get the city to put city land into conservation protection? It is currently owned by Lowell Public Schools but its a small forest of mostly wetlands. Tons of wildlife use it as a corridor, but its doesn't seem to be established as official wetlands, or protected in any way. There are tons of birds including a lot of raptors- eagles, hawks, songbirds, turkeys etc, deer, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, fishers, raccoons, muskrats, voles, red and gray squirrels, skunks, bats, cottontails, opossums, gophers, all types of frogs and toads, salamanders, garter snakes, crayfish, turtles... There are many streams and pools and the larger animals go through it daily - it is a vital source of food and water and habitat to them. Including into our own backyards, we have 2 raccoons in a den, 2 coyotes, nonstop birds, rabbits, shrews, and theres always somebody under our shed - sometimes a gopher, sometimes an opossum. We keep our land in a way that lives peacefully with the wildlife because we love it. We love to see the deer her through from the state forest and back. We love catching the coyotes and more elusive bobcats on trail cams in the night. The beautiful red fox darting through the snow on a winter morning. 

How do we even \*ask\* for the rest to be protected and preserved the way it is? It's been like this for decades but they did have it as an option for building a new high school at one point, which would've destroyed most of it. The possibility of the city demolishing this beautiful small forest / wetlands / natural corridor at some point is so depressing. It is next to the Lowell Dracut Tyngsboro State Forest. It is unfortunately used by what seems to be a middle school cross country team, who spray paints neon orange onto a BUNCH of the trees to ""mark"" an already very obvious trail, plus every rock and root on the ground because I guess they can't learn to look where they are going as part of running cross country - isn't that the point of it being different from a flat, even track? Kids run along the rest of the trail all the time and I've never seen any medflights or ambulances pulling anyone out of the woods for tripping over the natural landscape. The way they make it look like a small child was let loose with a full can of safety-orange spray paint is horribly ugly - but also definitely not good for the trees, surrounding plants and creatures, and any critters who don't know to avoid it. 

We've found entire contractor's bags full of kids baseball jerseys thrown off the edge of the parking lot at Leblanc Park, large piles of household trash dumped that never gets touched. Beer cans and broken glass on the trail, and off it. Soccer goals that must be from the soccer field we've found in the middle of the woods, closer to the Pawtucketville school there are file cabinets, picnic tables, office chairs and other furniture rotting and rusting away, some used at some point as pieces of makeshift homeless camps but long abandoned. We pick up what we can but the mess along the edge of the ""maintained"" part of the park is on a steep hill that is hard to carry things up alone, and once you do there's nowhere to put them. 

Is there a person or board to submit some kind of form or letter to ask them to consider making the forest area a conservation land or preserved as forest / wetlands, protected from being destroyed? It would be such a shame to ruin something so important to our ecosystem and the watershed, as these wetlands decrease flooding for surrounding neighborhoods, improve the water quality of the Merrimack River and protect the river and other water sources from dangerous algae, toxic chemicals used on land like fertilizers and weed killers, and high concentrations of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus. These are all things that get soaked up into wetlands, trapped in sediment, where plants and other natural processes break them down and make it less toxic. The water is essentially filtered by the wetlands. This water ends up in the Merrimack, an essential habitat for salmon as all Lowellians learned in middle school. And I think we can all agree the last thing the Merrimack needs is more water quality problems or another flood. It would probably carry away the Rourke bridge and the new Market Basket.

I've seen babies on occasion, but I feel like I haven't seen any mommas or babies recently, with my average count being about 6 adults (mostly noticed during food time) Was wondering what might be the cause of the issues.

General setup:
10g tank, medium sponge filter. Weekly water changes with dechlorinated tap. Feed a mix of algae wafers, or shrimp cuisine by Hikari once weekly. Heavily planted, with heater. Bacterae dosing 1-2x a month. Haven't been very diligent about vacuuming bottom as there is little sediment. 

I have been doing larger water changes recently (about 10-15%) once a week to lower by GH/KH, as my GH was 14 and kh was 7.

Parameters: GH 11, kh 7, ph 8.2, nitrite/nitrate 0, ammonia 0.5. Temp currently 77F, stays stable with heater. Snails seem to be thriving, so not sure why my shrimpies don't want to breed like rabbits.

Current theories: too much / little water changes? not fully cycled (ammonia is 0.5, but I feel like it should be cycled at a year out)? ph/gh/kh too high? need to vacuum more often? Wrong types of plants? TDS messed up and need to get a TDS reader? One of my plants being toxic somehow?

Yes, many countries have banned the use of phosphates in detergents, including the European Union and the United States. Phosphates are used in detergents to chelate calcium and magnesium ions, making them more efficient. However, phosphates can remain in wastewater and eventually make their way to natural bodies of water, causing nutrient pollution and algae feed. This can lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms. 

PFAS have been found in a wide variety of garments such as rain jackets, hiking pants, shirts and yoga pants and sports bras made by popular brands like Lululemon and Athleta. Forever chemicals are used as surface treatments to block water and stains.Mar 30, 2023

Washing causes a decrease in PFAA concentrations, and in general, volatile PFASs are partly washed out of the textiles. However, washing can also increase the extractable concentration of volatile PFASs in the fabrics.Apr 11, 2022

Some PFAS have been linked to some health problems in humans including higher cholesterol, lower birth weights, lower immune response to vaccines, kidney and testicular cancer, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and changes in liver function. If you are concerned about PFAS exposures, talk to your healthcare provider.

Drugs that can cause birth defects are called 'teratogens'. A teratogen is a substance that interferes with the normal development of a fetus.

Other studies have linked pesticides to birth defects, including:
Prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides: Has been linked to behavior
In utero exposure to Roundup or GLY: Has been linked to birth defects and fetal loss in mammals, frogs, and chickens 
Phosphorus is a mineral that helps build strong bones during pregnancy, and it also helps with muscle contractions, blood clotting, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm. 

Chemical Agents Associated With Miscarriage
Heavy metals (industrial workers, dental assistants)
Organic solvents (laboratory, industrial, and dry cleaning workers)
Tetrachloroethylene (dry cleaning workers)
Glycol ethers (semiconductor employees)
2-Bromopropane (electronics industry)
Petrochemicals.

Other investigations suggest that increased phosphates may contribute to various brain dysfunctions such as ischaemia (a restriction in blood supply) and Alzheimer's disease, among other neurodegenerative diseases.

Too much phosphate can be toxic. It can cause diarrhea and calcification (hardening) of organs and soft tissue, and can interfere with the body's ability to use iron, calcium, magnesium, and zinc.

Orbiting its fifth planet is a moon much like our Montera Luna, small and distant from its host star, but warmed by the radiant and reflected energy from the gas giant it orbits. Unlike Montera however, Zosma V is a ringed giant and unlike Luna, Zosma V-a orbits so closely that the planet does not so much hang in the sky as loom, its rings stretching across a full quarter of the horizon. in all our travels we have seen nothing to rival it. 

Like most satellites of gas giants, V-a is tidally locked, completing an orbit and thus one full rotation every 12 standard hours. While half the planet experiences a normal day/night cycle, the side facing the gas giant almost never experiences full darkness, with Zosma V's vast bulk looming eternally overhead, reflecting up to fifteen times as much light as the full moon on Akila,  As a result the near side of the planet is considerably warmer and more arid, but is also far more abundant in plant life. The plants here are rich in phycoerythrin (like many terrestrial forms of cyanobacteria and algae) which gives them a deep red color that dominates the color palette of this world. Zosma V-a is also very tectonically active, a result of the continual squeezing and stretching caused by Zosma V's titanic tidal forces as V-a spins through its swift orbit, and these volcanic processes maintain the thick atmosphere upon which all life upon it depends. 

The most common forms of life here are herbivorous, subsisting on the rust colored grasses, lichens, and algea that spread across most of the near side of the planet. These range in size from the small half-meter crawlers, to two-meter long aerial filter feeders that drift in the wind. Most impressive however are the two apex predators of this place: Spiderwasps are larger and more aggressive but the more numerous Roachstalkers are a terrifying predator with acidic blood and an astonishing swiftness, striking with the kind of speeds and impact forces normally associated with high caliber military weaponry.

Roaches are an unpleasant part of life, but if you live with dogs, your goal should be to avoid toxic pesticides at home. Just say no to the exterminator: According to the ASPCA, every year thousands of pets suffer and many die due to accidental ingestion of household poisons, especially insecticides. So, what *is* a pet-safe roach killer?

There are plug-in roach repellents, such as Riddex, but I have found they don‚Äôt work nearly as well as their hype says they do. Following folk wisdom, I‚Äôve tried sprinkling bay leaves in the corners of my cabinets as a deterrent; but the leaves are just no match for tough urban roaches.

You can clean like a demon and bathe your dogs every single day, but keeping immaculate pets in a spotless home simply isn‚Äôt enough to repel roaches.

In fact, you can clean all day long and still have roaches, because these creepy-crawlies are attracted by odors ‚Äî¬†the smells of dog food, dog bedding, your bedding, your laundry. And in the good ol‚Äô summertime, all those odors are magnified and made more pungent by high temperatures.

There are some non-toxic and pet-safe roach killers out there.

The most effective weapon in the anti-roach arsenal is diatomaceous earth, available for sale online. This white powder consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It‚Äôs completely harmless to pets and people, as long as you buy the food-grade kind (please do not use diatomaceous earth made for use in swimming pools). In fact, food-grade diatomaceous earth may be safely eaten by pets to fight internal parasites;it‚Äôs also effective at repelling mosquitos, fleas and even ticks if rubbed into an animal‚Äôs coat.

**Here‚Äôs how it works:** The microscopic particles in the powder actually cut up an insect‚Äôs waxy exoskeleton, effectively dessicating them. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (also known as diatom flour) wherever you‚Äôve noticed roaches. It‚Äôs especially effective if placed behind kitchen appliances and inside cabinets. No need to use gloves ‚Äì it‚Äôs perfectly safe to handle.

Don‚Äôt be discouraged if at first you seem to notice more roaches then before; for about a week after treating a roach-infested area with diatomaceous earth, you‚Äôll actually see more of the crawling nasties. That‚Äôs because, as the diatomaceous earth works to dessicate them, the dehydrating bugs will be actively on the move, hunting for water.

If you live with cats, diatomaceous earth is also an excellent way to extend the life of kitty litter. As any cat person knows, litter tends to poop out in high-humidity weather conditions; as it becomes damp and soggy, it stops absorbing odors and doesn‚Äôt clump as effectively. But diatomaceous earth‚Äôs naturally dessicating property helps cut down on odors by working to keep cat droppings dry.

## Pet-Safe Roach Repellent: Catnip

Speaking of cats, another way to deter roaches is catnip. Yes, believe it or not, kitty‚Äôs favorite herb is a natural roach repellent! The active ingredient in it is nepetalactone, which is non-toxic to people and pets. Simply pinpoint where the roaches are meeting up at your place, and leave out small sachets of catnip. Obviously, if you live with cats, this method won‚Äôt work because kitty will get busy relocating those catnip toys before they can deter any roaches!

## Do Not Use Boric Acid Anywhere Your Pet Can Access

Roaches happen to gravitate to high places, such as the tops of kitchen cabinets or shelving. Break out your ladder and put boric acid up there; the roaches will take the powder with them back to their nests. However, boric acid is harmful to dogs and people if ingested, so keep it far away from kids and pets. If your cat, say, can access the space between your cabinetry and your ceiling, do not use boric acid ‚Äî¬†use only diatomaceous earth instead.",19 Apr 2024 01:43:43,reddit

133,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c5xnac/has_anyone_ever_tried_the_lost_and_found_ritual/,Has anyone ever tried the Lost and Found Ritual?,"Have you ever wondered about things you‚Äôve lost? That toy car you remember having as a kid. That ring you had, tight on your finger as you dove into the sea, but gone when you got out. That braided phone charger, your middle-school homework book, I could go on.  

No need to answer. Everyone‚Äôs lost *something*, at some point, and never found it again. Their stories, without conclusion.

Most of us simply forget. We accept the fact that these things are lost, and quickly adapt to life without them. Just think‚Ä¶ what a wealth to be found if one were able to recover what is lost.

Don‚Äôt be fooled, though - this isn‚Äôt inane conjecture. For the wanting man, there is indeed a way to stick your hand into the lucky dip, and wrench something back into existence, all for yourself. To keep.

To bind you.

As far as I can tell, there‚Äôs no one strict name for this ritual. Call it whatever you want - perhaps its true name has, too, been lost. The place you‚Äôll be opening a gateway to, however, I‚Äôve heard referred to mostly as the *Cellar*. Or the *Basement*, the *Crypt*, but at the end of the day, these are just labels, and aren‚Äôt conducive to getting what you want. What matters is that it‚Äôs the mausoleum of all things lost. If Hell is the absence of the light of God, then the Cellar is bereft of the light of reality itself - for what is lost, may as well not exist.

The constraints of our universe hold little sway there, and become as fluid as the ocean.

Before I get to the steps you‚Äôll be following, and the risks posed to your wellbeing, it‚Äôs best to learn exactly what you‚Äôre going to need. Do NOT skip out on any of the following items:
* A candle. Well, you don‚Äôt need a candle and wick per se, just any wax you can melt by hand.
* A seal or mold of some kind. A signet ring is preferable, but the shape of the imprint you leave behind is mostly arbitrary - though I‚Äôd advise something circular, like a coin.
* A pair of bound objects. This can, really, be anything, although I‚Äôd advise going with something you probably couldn‚Äôt separate by hand; a pair of heavy chainlinks, for example.
* A driving tool, preferably a hammer and chisel.
* Human tears. Arguably the most difficult ingredient to procure in a sufficient amount, because not only do you need a good 10ml of the stuff to be safe, the tears cannot be those of pain. And no, you can‚Äôt cut an onion and expect those tears to work, nor can they be those of depression or despair. They must be tears of grief, for grief is the hoarse, wailing voice of the lost, and when you call out, you might get an answer.
* An heirloom of someone who has passed - even better if they were someone you were close with. A lover, a parent, a sibling, or a dear friend, just as long as you went through grief at their passing. Technically, this one is optional, but it sure as shit boosts your chances at a successful ritual.
* An offering. You don‚Äôt actually need to have it with you at the time, but make sure you have something important to you that can be put up for grabs.

You‚Äôll also need to find a rift. Now, don‚Äôt overthink this. You don‚Äôt need to go to the grand canyon, and you don‚Äôt need to find a portal - you‚Äôll already be making one, in essence. All that matters is that you‚Äôre able to pour wax into it: a crack, a split, hell, you could use a pothole if you‚Äôd like. Not recommended, though. No point in performing the ritual if you get turned into pate by a garbage truck halfway through.

And as these things always go, try to be somewhere away from the noise. No need for interruptions. In any case, the Gatekeeper will demand your full attention - you don‚Äôt want to lose in his game. I‚Äôve seen what happens to those who do, and trust me, you‚Äôre better off slitting your neck on the spot.

One more thing before I teach you how to go rooting around in the Cellar: even with a perfectly executed ritual, risk still remains. In the Cellar, rules of reality are fluid, broken and rewritten every second, which you‚Äôll remember from earlier if you have an attention span wider than the hairs on your head - if not, you shouldn‚Äôt be here at all.

When lost things are left to fester down there, they may serve as the base for a random, chaos-borne physical (or metaphysical) property that doesn‚Äôt exist up here. To avoid clunky lingo, you can think of them as curses. Cultures of conceptual mold and algae that cling fast to their host.

Yes, curses. Don‚Äôt let that word scare you away - a curse can just as easily be a blessing, depending on whose hands it falls into. You might retrieve a jar that perpetually rains tiny diamonds from no apparent source, or a teddy bear that imbues you with superhuman levels of confidence. But, you could also get a compass that kills any living creature on the direct opposite side of the Earth from you, or a fog machine that you can‚Äôt turn off, and drains your blood to vaporize into mist, regardless of where you are.

Because you are bound to it.

Now let's get to the steps:

First, find an isolated location and a hole or crack in the ground. Place the two linked objects on the left side of the hole, and if you‚Äôve brought an heirloom of a dead loved one, place it on the right. You'll need enough wax to melt and pour to fill the cavity you‚Äôve chosen. Bringing a portable stove or a blowtorch is ideal to melt a large quantity of wax at once. Pour the wax into the hole, and sprinkle it with the tears of grief you've obtained while it's still fluid. If the wax sets before you can add the tears, the ritual is over. Allow the wax to cool until malleable, then form an imprint with your stamping object of choice, like a signet ring.

You can take a break here while you wait for the second sigil to appear beside your imprint. Once it has fully formed, drive the chisel into it with the hammer, as deep as you can. When you feel it can't be pushed any further, twist the chisel in place. You should hear a distinct sound - really, you can't miss it. The gate is now unlocked and will open.

If you‚Äôre wondering why I‚Äôm sharing this information, the answer is simple. The more seekers, the more you and I stand to gain. And for those compelled to search for what they‚Äôve lost can anyone hope to stop them? Might as well make sure they‚Äôre well-informed, so I‚Äôve chosen to document my last dive into the Cellar. 

I chose an abandoned building on the outskirts of town where I was certain no one would interrupt. The moment I completed the ritual, a miasma began to spread and unfold from the cracked floor, and in the blink of an eye I was plunged into the depths. The first thing to greet me was the Gatekeeper. 

Though his appearance can change, he most commonly takes the form of a decrepit old man covered in sores and scabs. His robes might‚Äôve once been regal but now they were tattered and filthy. He wore a rusted battered crown and carved into his forehead, weeping and scarified was the word ‚ÄúKING.‚Äù

You cannot enter or leave the Cellar without a wager and challenge. You get to set some parameters for the challenge, so play to your strengths. If you‚Äôre smart, you can ask for a game of riddles or logic; if you‚Äôre athletic, you can ask for a test of strength or stamina. I always chose a game of hide and seek where I had to avoid capture for a period of time set by the Gatekeeper. I was good at it, and had always emerged from the Cellar unscathed. 

As for the wager, what you stand to lose can‚Äôt be trivial. Could be your ability to walk, a loved one, even your life‚Ä¶ Now before him, as I had done every time, I wagered the thing I value most. With empty eyes and a ravenous smile, he let me pass.

The Cellar always looks different and varies from person to person; you might find yourself in an ancient library stretching into infinity, every bookshelf lined with items long lost, or in an endless prairie with artifacts scattered about at random. Maybe it's a metaphysical space, partly shaped by your mind, I don't know. Just a theory. This time it was a dingy thrift store consisting of narrow corridors that wound and twisted around themselves to create a multi-story tangle of shelves, junk piles, and showrooms of old furniture. The air was rank, each inhale an acrid sting, and the lighting was dim orange.

A draft snaked its way through me, sinking bitter cold fangs into my bones, being here was a small agony unto itself. But the endless possibilities of what I might find drove me forward. I rummaged through some piles of lost things and found the usuals. A metric ton of socks, countless kitchen utensils, old photos, and anything else you can think of. 

I‚Äôve found ancient lost tomes and scrolls if you care to parse lost knowledge and mysticism. The only caveat is that they're all in long-dead languages. Relics and archaeological treasures are common too but I‚Äôve never had any interest in them. Then there are the cursed objects, the ones almost all seek. You know when you‚Äôve found one, the air is poisoned with a rancid odor and malice radiates outwards from them. Holding one in your hand should feel wrong, and deeply unsettling. Your blood runs cold, your chest tightens and your stomach twists itself into knots. You‚Äôll ask yourself what the hell you‚Äôre doing here and what this thing is capable of. 

All I can say is if you choose to pocket a cursed item you need to be incredibly cautious and aware from that moment forward because God knows what it can do. They‚Äôre unpredictable so carrying one around for an extended amount of time is a gamble and here time is inconstant and ever-shifting. 

The one I found on this trip was a silver pendant with a black gemstone at its center. I snatched it and quickly and cautiously snaked around an aisle toward a new room. That‚Äôs the trick, never linger too long and always be on the move. There are things here‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what they are. Maybe they‚Äôre searching too or maybe they're part of the lost. But they‚Äôre never friendly, so try not to spend too long in any one area, five minutes maximum and move on.

Looping back around to a room to search again is improbable since this realm is prone to shifting and warping around. Which is why multiple trips are common amongst those who delve. I want to say it gets easier every time but consistently something new reveals itself to me, always malicious.

This time, winding around a corridor into a larger chamber, it was a black room. As in the light here was negative, inverting every color. My eyes strained and my head thrummed at the sight so I pivoted around to leave and find another way through. But things never go to plan in this place.

I froze at the threshold, pivoted to look behind me and glimpsed it for a mere moment as it ducked behind an alabaster wall. Tendrils like wisps of black smoke coiled out of sight. Stalker. I‚Äôd rather face the negative room and its unknown than an abyssal stalker and so I turned back around and stepped into the anti-light. 

The darkstone pendant shone with a warm, greenish-yellow light in the black room, like a luminescent moss. Examining it more closely as I turned it in my shaking hand, a surge of recognition hit me of a sudden: a New England beach town, my first love. Mariel. 

We‚Äôd decided to take a trip there for a few days in fall during college, and she‚Äôd given it to me as a memento of our first trip together. A small hunk of some glassy, black material, probably onyx or obsidian, with a thin, red fissure running through it, all hung on a delicate silver chain, as tenuous as love itself. A heart had been carved or chipped into the black stone, the red stripe coursing through its center.

It had gotten misplaced some months later in our apartment, the loss sparking our first row. First of many, truth be told. In my mind, this fight was linked to our inevitable (and, to my mind - wholly avoidable) breakup. But, the bond we shared, Mariel and I, had been broken. What happened to her after we split was not something I could let my mind delve into - too much to do right now to let that distract me, and fear made me stay on task in this unnatural place.

If lost items took on an infectious, almost fungal nature here in this moldy place of living nightmares‚Ä¶what would happen if I moved *deeper*? Could it be reversed? Could the depraved, parasitic nature of the lost things become‚Ä¶a thing of hope? Or reunion? I dare not wish for such a thing. Mariel was lost to me and it was folly to think she should ever become mine once again. For if she did, would she be the same as I once knew her, pale and kind, sweet as a bud in spring? Or would the trickery and deception of this dank place transmogrify her into something inhuman? I didn‚Äôt have the time, or the wits, to think on it further,

I pocketed the charm and listened for the spectral being I had seen in the alabaster room. Was this being the Gatekeeper I had heard of when I first learned of how to unseal and delve into this forbidden place? Or was it something worse, and far more defiled, that dwelled below the Cellar?

Though I may have heard a faint scraping sound, no lumbering beast appeared, nothing slouched towards Bethlehem to be born, so I crept onward on tremulous legs. As I left the black room, I noticed a small group of moths flying away from it on dusty wings. It was *that* dark.

The next room was again lined with shelves, brick walls dancing with candle light. The shelves sagged with row upon row of dusty books, ornate sketches of unholy words in rolls, small jade figurines, dozens or hundreds of other items. The light in here was of the same quality as the obsidian pendant gave off in the black room; warm, slightly yellow, a shade of sickly green mixed in. This room in the old shop smelled of candlesmoke and old paper - a smell I had always loved, since my family ran a small bookstore in Virginia. Alongside this familiar smell was one of corruption, acidic rot, a foul sense of loneliness and abandonment. I think the fact that the Cellar plucks relevant ideas from your life to construct its space was what made it form this room for me, but it added its own hint of malice alongside it.

As I explored this new space, I was acutely aware of a sudden drop in temperature and my skin broke out in a rash of goosebumps, my armhair standing erect. Nothing moved in the shadows, but I was aware that I was once more not alone, and the feeling unnerved me. A soft sweeping sound, fabric moving against rough brick, perhaps, seemed to emanate maliciously from behind me. I glimpsed another of those smoky tendrils as it slowly crawled across the floor and curled around my ankles, like an evil cat cozying up to you in a cursed bodega.

The brick room seemed to go only up - the short hallway I was in ended in another brick wall, two wrought-iron sconces holding dripping, flickering candles. The ceiling seemed impossibly far away, disappearing into a foul gray mist hundreds of feet up; no escape there. I scoured the shelves for anything that might aid me in evading the cursed definitely-not-a-bodega-cat creature. 

The sibilant sound intensified slightly behind me, and more dark, malevolent spirals appeared on the floor. I rifled through the items on the shelves hurriedly; a hunk of greenish glass, cracked and crazed, that seemed to glow subtly in the dimly-lit room; a cloth child‚Äôs doll, string hanging where the button-eyes had been plucked out, rough black thread sewing the red gash of a mouth shut. The last one made my bowels shake with fear, though I could not have confessed why, even if I was held at knifepoint.

The temperature dropped a few more degrees and a tremulous shiver ran through me. As I sifted through the items on the rough, wooden shelves, my shaking hand closed on something even colder than the room itself; a strange chrome hammer with a very small head and a long handle, the word FREEMAN stamped on it. Sitting next to it was a long, sharp metal object, ending in a small, flat blade with a mean edge. It was about the size of a standard household screwdriver, but this was nothing you‚Äôd ever find in your old man‚Äôs toolbox, even if he did handiwork in Hell. *Danvers State Mental Hospital: Ward 9* had been etched into the haft of the object. 

A thought began to form in the back of my mind.

*What if I‚Ä¶*

*No,* I countered (myself) - *It won‚Äôt work - it‚Äôs utter madness.*

My reveries were interrupted by an intensification of the sound behind me and a thickening of the black fog, now swirling around my knees. My fear swelled and deepened.

Moving quickly, I grabbed the small hammer and screwdriver-looking object. I approached the brick wall, the dark, swirling shapes now seeming to tug at me. My legs felt the way they do in bad dreams, as if walking through switchgrass or wading in deep water. I reached up for one of the candles, lifted it out of the sconce with trembling hands and leaned in to examine the wall. 

*There. *

A small fissure in the mortar between bricks. The bricks on either side of the crack stuck out just enough to make a small shelf. The rift was no larger than a pencil, but it would have to do. 

Now, I know there are rules here in the Cellar, and I know I don‚Äôt have all the requisite items with me. But, perhaps, I had enough of them. Perhaps the fact that everything‚Ä¶ *changes* down here, that even this place doesn‚Äôt follow its own rules, might let me bend whatever guidelines there were just enough that I could pull it off. 

A thought came to me in this dank and mildewed place, filling me with a new species of fear: what lies *beyond* the Cellar? 

I quickly separated the black pendant from the silver chain and hung the chain to the right of the crack. The rough, uneven bricks provided enough purchase that the tiny chain could be suspended, although the grip was tenuous at best. (*Much like my current grip on reality*, I thought). The pendant itself would have to serve as the seal. 

Another quick scan of the shelves turned up nothing that could be described as anything linked. No chains, no cufflinks, no‚Ä¶

*Hold up.*

I quickly snapped two links from the silver pendant chain and held them in my shaking palm. In all my years of performing the ritual, I had never seen anything so small, so pathetic. But, it was all I had. I put them on a wee outcropping of brick to the left of the crack, carefully so as not to drop them, although my quivering hands meant that I had to try three times before they settled into their place. They looked as small and as fragile as two hummingbird eggs.

The black smoke twisted and grabbed around my waist as I tipped the candle and dripped the wax into the small void between bricks. I completed the next steps of the ritual and stepped back.

And waited. 

Nothing happened. 

I don‚Äôt know if my half-assed version of the ritual didn‚Äôt work once you were already in the Cellar. Perhaps the linked items didn‚Äôt work, or the seal was wrong. Of if my thinking itself was wrong and the rules that applied in the world also applied down here, but I didn‚Äôt have time to find out. 

Whatever had been stalking me had just turned the corner, leaving me trapped in the brick-lined hallway as the black smoke seemed to turn solid and root me to the floor. 

I braced for the impact I knew was coming any second now. With the hammer in one hand, and that screwdriver thing in the other, I kept my eyes peeled on the fog. I was in flight or fight mode, and the flight option had been taken from me.

The scraping I‚Äôd heard earlier paled in comparison to what I was hearing now. The sound of the scraping was intensified, and beneath it was another sound entirely. It was a sound I‚Äôd only ever heard in movies, all squishy and fleshy. The kind of thing a foley artist would get from peeling off chunks of raw meat and rubbing  them together vigorously.

Next came the smell, all toxic and rotten. It made my eyes burn and water, clouding my vision. It burned my nose and throat, leaving a strange acidic taste in my mouth. Fear gripped my spine. Whatever this thing was had more or less disabled me and I hadn‚Äôt even seen it yet!

Just as that thought settled in my brain, it slowly emerged from the fog before me. No description I can provide here will truly do it justice, though I‚Äôll do my best.

It was all tea leaves and Rorschach to me. Shapes that should make sense to my brain, but for whatever reason weren‚Äôt. Its structure was somewhere between melted wax and slime, so even if some semblance of shape was briefly recognizable it was always shifting.

The only thing that made sense was its mouth, as far as enormous rotting maws full of goo dripping razors made sense anyway. Unable to focus on the rest of its face, that‚Äôs what I stared at. 

So, there I stood, unable to move and facing my impending doom. In that moment, I did what any sane person would do in that situation‚Ä¶I pissed myself. Most of it was from fear, but there was a tiny little voice on my head that insisted it was in defiance. If it was going to eat me, the least I could do was make myself smell and taste less appealing.

It scraped and oozed its way ever closer, until it was standing directly in front of me. It places ruined and vaguely hand-shaped things on my shoulders and leaned in. The tea leaves and Rorschach shifted again, this time creating some semblance of a face as its structure hardened.

Two endless pits appeared where eyes would have been in a normal face. From them seeped the same greenish-yellow light I‚Äôd seen earlier. Two slits appeared below them as it leaned in to sniff me. 

Suddenly, my senses returned to me, I raised the hammer and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to start calling this thing a pick now. Typing the words screwdriver thing just isn‚Äôt doing it for me. So, yeah, I raised the hammer and the pick as it leaned in. I quickly positioned the pick in the center of its forehead and slammed the hammer down on the flat edge of it, driving that pick right into the creature‚Äôs brain.

With the lobotomy achievement unlocked, I took a moment to breathe. I‚Äôd done it! I‚Äôd‚Ä¶made it angry. Its mouth opened wider and a roar ripped from its throat with all the effects of a concussion grenade. My hearing was shot and my brain was acting like I was under water. My feet suddenly came free from the floor and I stumbled backwards and fell onto my ass.

It continued to roar as it moved forward, slime still dripping from the razors in its mouth. My ears were ringing so hard I couldn‚Äôt even hear the scrape and squish from earlier. I scooted backwards until my back hit a wall. There was nowhere left to go.

Closer it came, looming over me now. The slime coated my face as I stared up into that roaring maw. I could feel it burning my skin. I lost myself in the endless pools of sickly light as I waited to die. 

The hand-like shapes grabbed my ankles and tugged hard as it turned, dragging me behind it. I could feel every crack of the uneven floor as it tore my clothes and scraped my skin. I ditched the hammer, useless without the pick still stuck in the creature‚Äôs skull. I was on the lookout for anything I might be able to use when I noticed the pendant and its broken chain. I palmed it, chain and all, as I slid by it.

On we went, it dragged me through the maze of rooms and corridors to some mysterious destination. Some floors were smoother than others, and for those sections I was thankful. My clothing was being quickly reduced to shreds, and if this journey went on much longer I feared the same would happen to my flesh.

I‚Äôd seen things that might be useful as we went, but nothing that was within my reach. The creature never stopped, and there was no way to increase my height while in a constant state of movement. I managed to hold the pendant above my head. It glowed much more strongly now, and it illuminated the creature dragging me away. Except, what I saw was not a monster. A frail, naked woman, gripping me with impossible strength. Just before I gave up and closed my eyes, she turned to me, and the fraction of a second my eyes remained open was enough for me to recognise the face that stared back. And good God, it scared my brain blank.

By the time it released its grip on me, we‚Äôd just entered an area that emanated pure darkness. With the sheer amount of pain I was in, I almost didn‚Äôt realize the pressure around my ankles was disappearing. The floor here was smooth and cold, soothing my aches just enough to sober me, but not enough to take them away.

I stayed that way for a while. It‚Äôs impossible to say how long I was laying there in the darkness. My hearing was slowly getting back to being useful, and I neither heard nor felt any sign of the creature‚Äôs presence now. Eventually, the adrenaline fled my system and the pain took over completely. 

Just as my eyelids began to droop from sheer exhaustion, a bright light flooded the room and nearly blinded me. It shocked me awake and I scrambled to get my legs beneath me. I turned to look around the room on wobbly legs, trying to determine from which direction the danger would come from next.

As my eyes adjusted, the light seemed to dim and become stained with the same tint I‚Äôd seen in the creature‚Äôs eyes - sickly, sallow green. The first thing I could identify was far above me. Hanging, like a chandelier from a ceiling drenched in shadow, was a black moon. Beams of glowing midnight fanned out from it, revealing that the Cellar‚Äôs structural elements were gone. Only one structure stood before me.

A great podium of pockmarked ashen rock, perhaps basalt, rose about three stories high, with a spiraling staircase hewn from it, coiling to the very top. The tower rested on nothing, and a sudden wave of vertigo took me when I noticed chunks and chips from the tower, suspended in motion below it, below where I was standing, as if God had pressed pause at the moment of its ruin and forgotten to press play again.

Placed on the flat peak of the tower, sunworn with most of its spindles either snapped or missing, was a chair. Maybe oak, but it was too far gone to tell. And atop *that*, resting in the chair as if it were a notice of reservation, I saw a battered crown. A crown better fit for melting down than to be worn with any dignity. And yet, past the ugly skin of it, I sensed temptation, so deep and eternal it inspired an almost primal sense of want - no, better yet, *need*. I *had* to have it, without being sure why.

On the periphery of this void space, I detected movement. Figures wreathed in dark, shifting and shuddering. I had no fear, I simply ignored them and approached the bottom of the stairs, entranced.

A few steps, and I hissed in pain. My palm burned. The pendant, yes, I‚Äôd managed to grab it while being ferried to this place. Now, in the presence of the black moon above, it radiated both light and searing heat. I threaded the broken chain through the loop affixed to the pendant and held it up in front of me.

*Like an oil lantern*, I thought.

The light‚Ä¶ it had a special quality about it. I remembered how it illuminated the creature‚Äôs face, and‚Äì

My skin flushed. No, that wasn‚Äôt real. A trick of the mind, of the light in the Cellar. That‚Äôs all. That reasoning was made ever more flimsy when I shone the pendant on the tower. It looked different in the light. At first I was unable to distinguish what stood before me, so I took a few steps back.

A skeleton. Two skeletons, in fact, entangled in death. The first and largest of the two appeared to be that of an enormous, winged humanoid, an outstretched hand serving as the chair in which the crown was nestled. The second was that of an equally massive serpent, coiled around the first skeleton, its head trapped beneath the winged humanoid‚Äôs reaching hand.

I hadn‚Äôt appreciated the thick silence until it was broken. A voice rang out, saying,

‚ÄúIs one such as thee so uncaring, or simply aloof?‚Äù

Without needing to see its source, I knew exactly who that voice belonged to.

‚ÄúNope. Just bored and curious.‚Äù

The voice erupted into a dry cackle, and the void moon in the sky pulsed in rhythm. I tore free a hanging shred from my shirt, all ripped up thanks to that creature, and used it to swaddle the pendant, muffling the sight of the two skeletons. Again, I saw a stone tower, and I promptly made my way to the staircase and began to ascend.

I soon reached the top, a plateau that suggested the tower had once been much taller, but at some point, was cleaved apart. I tried not to think of what could have possibly done such a thing, instead turning my attention to the chair.

It was occupied. Sitting in it was a man, facing away from me, wearing that same battered crown. The tattered ribbons of his robes seemed to float, as if underwater, and parted to make way as I rounded the chair to stand in front. The man‚Äôs eyes looked so empty. The scars on his forehead spelling the word ‚ÄúKING‚Äù wrinkled in a scowl, and those eyes remained unfocused as he spoke again.

‚ÄúAt least you know now.‚Äù

‚ÄúKnow what?‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúThat this is all there is. You can go no further. There is nothing beyond this accursed tomb. Regardless, you did something you should not have. Did you come here with a death wish?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù

The gravity of the situation came crashing down. Here I was, in the Gatekeeper‚Äôs domain, utterly helpless to do anything but listen as his voice emerged again like crackling embers, reignited by the wind.

‚ÄúThere, in thine hand. You cannot hide it from me, you know.‚Äù

I stuttered, fighting for air. At this, the Gatekeeper‚Äôs lips stretched into a cracked and inflamed smile.

‚ÄúWhat else? Is this fool dissatisfied with his new plaything?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, surprised by my own aplomb, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm looking for something else. Rest assured, this here pendant is the only thing I‚Äôll be leaving with, physically speaking.‚Äù

His smile fell to a smirk, accompanied by a cocked eyebrow.

‚ÄúAnd again I ask; art thou without empathy, or simply lacking sense? You would stand there, in front of *me*, whilst the wager is in *my* hand, and think nothing of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt lost yet, have I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou were going to leave with‚Ä¶ show me.‚Äù

I shielded the cloth-wrapped pendant from view.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

‚ÄúI beseech thee, *show me*!‚Äù

Reluctantly, I extricated it from the layers of cloth, and presented the pendant, chain and all. On seeing it, the Gatekeeper devolved back into a rasping chuckle.

‚ÄúAh, that. How coincidental!‚Äù

‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù I asked cautiously.

‚ÄúThy wager, maggot. That which you love most, and hold most dear to thy glassen little heart. Do not deceive thyself; you saw her, didst thou not? That pendant is a special relic indeed.‚Äù

I knew exactly what he was talking about. That creature‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I saw‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about.‚Äù

Immediately, all the smugness dropped from his face. His sore-ridden skin contorted with anger, lined by warty ridges. He shot up from the chair, a way that didn't seem to utilize three dimensions. Made my head hurt. It was as if he‚Äôd vanished and materialized standing face-to-face with me. He spoke in a growl of controlled wrath.

‚ÄúOh? Hast thine eyes become foggy? Then let it be made clear: last time, I let you believe you won. *You did not*. Thus, the wager for this visit - being the same one you‚Äôve used every time - was, how to put it‚Ä¶ expired. What‚Äì *who* you love most. Well, *loved* most.‚Äù

The Gatekeeper threw his head back and snorted. The very thing I hadn‚Äôt wanted to accept crawled down my throat and settled in my stomach, heavy as molten lead, and shrouding my head in a contradictory haze of confused clarity. Then, the Gatekeeper made my fears into reality.

‚ÄúOh Mariel! Be a dear and come up for tea.‚Äù

Out there in the shadows, one of the shifting figures changed. It crept into the light, became more real somehow. I didn‚Äôt turn to look. I couldn‚Äôt. Whether it was from some occult force or sheer terror, my muscles wouldn‚Äôt budge an inch.

But I could hear it. Wet, frictional, and strangely manufactured, a sound hailing an overpowering stink, growing stronger with every encroaching step, mustard gas, rotten eggs. My eyes began to water from the stench.

My arm rose up with a mind of its own, directing the pendant towards the top of the stairs. Black moonlight burned darker still to resonate with it, invigorating it, and bathing the newly emerged figure in light. For a moment, a fraction of a second, it was all Rorschach and swirling tea leaves again. Teeth like stalactites dripped with secretions below a pair of deep, glowing pits.

The creature entered the light, and stopped.

She looked so, so unhappy. Standing there, naked and withered, all her hair, gone. Her teeth too, leaving behind rotten, puffy gums. Only one eye had been plucked out - not because of any mercy, no. It was more like a punchline. A perverted joke. But one eye was all she needed to convey a kind of anger I‚Äôd never seen before. A kind of anger that needed no coal to fuel it. A kind of anger that can never be extinguished. If it weren‚Äôt for her emaciated body, she‚Äôd have flown into a rampage - and even if she could, no catharsis would ever be enough. She‚Äôd have torn me to shreds, she‚Äôd have skinned my mother alive in front of me and still it wouldn‚Äôt be enough. I barely felt the tears streaming down my cheeks under the scrutiny of that single eye.

*Tears right for the ritual*, I thought.

I tried to speak, to say anything at all, but my throat was tight shut. Either way, the Gatekeeper was satisfied.

‚ÄúI may be one to withhold information, but I am no more a liar than you are honest to thyself.‚Äù

He paused to gaze at her. At my love. At the thing I valued most, and it really hit me then. The magnitude of what I‚Äôd lost. Not just Mariel, but my trust in‚Ä¶ everything. Gone.

‚ÄúOkay, Mariel. That will be plenty from thee.‚Äù

With a flick of his wrist, the Gatekeeper sent her tumbling through the air, off the tower, and back into the dark, where she will remain until the stars themselves are lost.

‚ÄúWorms, the lot of them. They don‚Äôt understand the purpose of this place, of why it was made. Of what it houses. It is something demons covet, and that God sent angels seeking for. Do you seek it, sojourner?‚Äù

I felt whatever force that held me in place lift from my body, and I wheeled around to face the Gatekeeper again, staring him down with my smoldering indignance. The pendant, as if empathizing, flared, bright as a tungsten filament, more than enough to illuminate the face of the man before me - and his, too, was a facade.

Gone was his giddy rictus, bloated with greed and derision. The eyes now staring deep into my own were dour and heavy  - not with wrath, but misery. It made Mariel look quite comfortable by comparison. It was the face of the first to grieve, of one whose eyes have cried themselves dry as salt.

His voice underlined that sentiment. A withered croak that told of ancient ruins lost beneath desert sand and, above all, sounded unequivocally honest.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ it is no treasure they seek. Power it is not, nor any blessing of the sort. I have been its keeper for‚Ä¶ since‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know. Too long.‚Äù

The Gatekeeper laughed, but it was hollow and came out more as a flurry of gasps.

‚ÄúDo you want to know?‚Äù

A cold chill flushed my entire body. I know the right choice would‚Äôve been, ‚Äúno,‚Äù but the only thought running through my mind was, ‚Äú*I‚Äôve come this far*.‚Äù

So I nodded.

‚ÄúWhat could have such value, that God Himself cannot already conjure? Well, in a way, He did create it. But it was an accident. A side-effect, a natural byproduct of the creation of something that lives on to this day, something that continues to exist within all of His children on Earth. It is the shadow of that, and also the relinquishment of it. I speak with you now freed from its grasp - the one you have been speaking with is not me. I do not‚Äì *cannot* control this vessel. I can only observe as it acts on its own.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust tell me!‚Äù I yelled, not out of impatience, but mounting terror. The Gatekeeper continued as if he hadn‚Äôt heard me.

‚Äú I still don‚Äôt understand why it does the things it does. It shouldn‚Äôt be doing anything, because it is the anti-will. The shadow of agency, the counterpart that was necessary to be born to allow the freedom of choice, the very same you used to decide to visit this place. I don‚Äôt know what that pendant is, but oh, it is good to breathe again. To speak. The ones who covet the anti-will‚Ä¶ perhaps I‚Äôm too small and insignificant to comprehend their motives. Why, God? Why would you want to abandon yourself? Please, my friend, you have to free me, you‚Äì‚Äù

I‚Äôd heard enough. In one shaky motion I drew back the pendant, and no sooner had I stashed it away than the Gatekeeper leapt at me, all his rage and hunger returned. I understood now. The entity before me was impossible, and yet here it was. The emptiness where a will should be, not only acting by itself, but grabbing me by the throat to pull me in close.

‚ÄúAnswer me! Wilt thou, or wilt thou not?‚Äù

I strained to force words past cold fingers tightening around my windpipe.

‚ÄúW-what? Will I what?‚Äù

‚Äú*DAREST THOU TEST ME!?*‚Äù

Had some hidden conversation taken place when I was speaking with the Gatekeeper - the *real* one? Had something been asked of me? I didn‚Äôt have time to rationalize, all I knew was my vision was turning black, so I did all I could think of to release myself.

‚ÄúYes, okay, yes I will, I‚Äì‚Äù

With that, he let go, spilling me onto the ground where I clawed at my throat and gasped for air.

‚ÄúVery well. Thou hast come far, and so I bestow upon thee this gift. Remember, one thing at a time, so I will be taking this. Don‚Äôt be greedy.‚Äù

He bent down and snatched the pendant, still glowing dimly. Without pause, he straightened, and pointed a finger directly upwards, at the black moon hanging above. On cue, it burst like a popped water balloon, raining a supernova of shadow down on my shivering body. I felt the ground disappear from under my hands. I rose, up and up towards an empty filament, and with one final glance, I saw the Gatekeeper. The power released from the shattered moon reinvigorated the pendant and it shone on his face. That tired, eternally tortured face. It was smiling. His body seemed to decay in time lapse into flakes, flittering away in an unfelt breeze. With the last vestiges of his strength, I heard him whisper something that sounded like,

‚ÄúThank‚Ä¶ you‚Ä¶ from the bottom of my heart‚Ä¶‚Äù

A dark tunnel filled with blinking lights - or eyes - and the sensation of something worming its way inside my body.

Then, I was back. Back in the abandoned building on the outskirts of town. I checked myself, no pendant, as I expected. Was the Gatekeeper telling the truth? The anti-will? I didn‚Äôt understand. Had I reAlly bEEn givEN ~~THE DEATH OF CHOICE???~~

~~STOP THIS~~ I suppose the Gatekeeper must have punished me for breaking the rules, and forced me to leave empty-handed. Yes, that‚Äôs it; empty-handed.

Now, most of you reading will have thought by now: why share this experience? How does it provide any significant insight into the ritual itself?

I think it‚Äôs as simple as being prepared. Would you go skydiving without seeing some footage beforehand? Would you tempt the wolves, not knowing their predilections? If so, well, fools are still welcome in the Cellar, but it‚Äôs more fun when there‚Äôs a challenge.

I‚Äôm running out of time. If I want to get this out there, it needs to be done now. I‚Äôve inherited such a ~~terrible curse~~ wonderful gift, and what is a game without the gamemaster?

So come on, plunge your hands into the lucky dip, take your pick and ~~GET OUT LET ME OUT~~ go home a little richer. Or perhaps you‚Äôve lost something - in which case, I know just the place to search, so come and take back what is rightfully yours. Or something that isn‚Äôt. ~~THIS IS NOT M~~ Serendipity, I say.

I look forward to the fun we are going to have.

Whether it‚Äôs a retail store, office building, or industrial complex, the cleanliness and appearance of commercial spaces significantly impact customer perception and employee morale. This is where the power of professional cleaning services, including power washing and commercial cleaning, comes into play. Check out:¬†[**parking lot cleaning Hagerstown MD**](https://hagerstownpowerwashing.com/)

These services not only ensure a pristine environment but also contribute to a healthier and more inviting workspace.

The Importance of Commercial Cleaning: Maintaining a clean and tidy commercial space is crucial for several reasons:

1. Health and Safety: Cleanliness directly affects the health and safety of employees and customers. A clean environment reduces the risk of accidents, minimizes the spread of illnesses, and promotes overall well-being.

2. Enhanced Productivity: A clutter-free and organized workspace fosters productivity among employees. Studies have shown that workers are more focused and efficient in clean environments, leading to better performance and higher morale.

3. Professional Image: A clean and well-maintained commercial space reflects positively on the business‚Äôs reputation. It conveys professionalism, attention to detail, and a commitment to quality, which can attract customers and instill confidence in stakeholders.

4. Longevity of Assets: Regular cleaning helps preserve the longevity of furniture, fixtures, and equipment. By removing dirt, dust, and grime, commercial cleaning services prevent premature wear and tear, ultimately saving businesses money on repairs and replacements.

¬∑ Health and Safety Compliance: Cleanliness extends beyond indoor spaces; it‚Äôs also essential for the exterior of commercial properties. Power washing ensures compliance with health and safety regulations by eliminating hazards such as slippery surfaces and mold growth.

¬∑ Enhanced Property Value: A well-maintained exterior enhances the overall value of a commercial property. Whether it‚Äôs attracting potential tenants or impressing clients, a clean and inviting exterior can positively impact property value and investment returns.

I went to see a dermatologist and my pcp and ran an entire panel to make sure everything was in check and nothing came abnormal out. I had been reading about Vitamin A toxicity and thought this might be causing the issue.
I take cod liver oil daily which has vitamin A and adding topical Vitamin A maybe was too much. I abandoned the new routine. The round bald spot got smaller and smaller, but I still have a little spot that has not grown back.

149,https://i.redd.it/lh0vzdm0n4rc1.png,I'm on earliest stages of building my world. And I need several thoughts,"Hi there! You may think that this is an image of ancient eldritch horror but, actually, it is a map. Well, a sketch of a map of my fantasy world (part of it). But if your eyes start bleeding after you see this image - I think it's a compliment for me! Ok. So, white is ground, black is water. For context - this sketch was prepared for Wonderdraft, so this is a reason for such an interesting choice of color.

Oh, and I should say that I already made a post with this map more than a year ago, but I was lazy enough all that time to make nothing with it. Plus my doubts. Plus overthinking. Plus bad ideas that I couldn't reject for quite  a long time.. Though, I decided to return to that project and make something already.

Well, the main reason why I‚Äôm making this post is because I want to know if my ideas are interesting enough for people. And I have some ideas that I think are questionable.  I need someone's clear sight. So, all this long text is quite a boring bunch of facts about Akuma - my fantasy world. First of all - Akuma means ""evil spirit"" or ""devil"" in japanese. I suggest, this is the perfect name for this planet.

This planet is the third moon of a brown dwarf, and I can call it ""moon"" because the brown dwarf itself orbits a red dwarf star making this star system binary. There are three planets between red dwarf (RD) and brown dwarf (BD). RD is slightly heavier than half of the sun. BD has a mass of 54 Jupiters. All three planets between them are lighter than Earth. 

BD has six moons (or planets if you want). 5 of them are lighter than Earth, third is Akuma and 6 is, interestingly - a gas giant with moon. I made a model of this system in Universe Sandbox so it seems quite realistic despite being quite unlikely.

Well, I don't know of any real star system similar to it - no brown dwarf was found in such a strange configuration with a red dwarf. But I make it with purpose (!!!). Like, I want my fantasy world to be ""dark and spooky"" but I want it to be scientifically possible and still good enough for highly developed forms of life. Though most of its people evolved here good enough to live with all its ""spookiness'' without any problem. (Dark lighting from the planet's stars isn't the biggest problem). Forgot to say that Akuma has a mass of 77% of Earth.

So Akuma's environment is affected by both RD and BD. Needless to say that Akuma is tidally locked. And I work with half of the planet that can't see BD. So people here don't even know that they live on ""moon-like object"". Akuma's orbital period is 26 hours. The orbital period of BD around RD is 217 earthly days. 

While modeling in Universe Sandbox I make sure that Akuma's temperature is good enough for life, though in this model BD had an orbital period of 183 days. Well, it's slightly more than half of our year so I thought it was kinda boring. So I assumed that the effects of BD can expand the habitable zone for Akuma so I make BD's orbital period longer - 217 days. So Akuma's year is still lesser than Venus' year but its day is two hours longer than ours. 201 local days.

RD makes the sky on this planet reddish. And people here can see the brightest stars even during daytime. Scientists say that stars here might appear blue, but, well, if you were born in a red dwarf system and all your ancestors too, I suppose you wouldn't be able to see blue, green, and purple, and maybe all colors that are higher on the spectrum than orange and, maybe, yellow. You won't even know what it is.. It definitely creates some problems for my future writing‚Ä¶

Because of the red light, plants on Akuma are red or black. Plants' color depends on the environment and height, so some plants here are really brighty red and some are blacker than my soul. Like, plants in the mountains are red, because they need more protection from sunlight while plants in the lowest part of forest are quite black because for them catching sunlight is definitely uneasy. Well, I assume, there are no other specific effects of RD on the Akuma surface.

The impact of BD is interesting too. Every fucking day Akuma fluctuates. Because of BD's gravitation. You know, planets' orbits are not exactly round, so they have some part where they are closer to their parent object and part where it's farther. So to be short: every 26 hours of Akuma's day/night cycle (its orbital period) gravitation of BD stretches and squeezes it. Well, there is quite a big chance that in reality such a planet becomes hellish as Venus or Io...  

So BD's gravitation creates a lot of inner heat under Akuma's crust and this makes it warmer but consequence of it is quite wild tectonic activity. Volcanoes everywhere!!! And volcanic winters... sometimes. Earthquakes here and there... Such kind of stuff. Well, if you wondering why shape of continents on my map is such... strange, it is because of fucking BD's gravitation that plays with Akuma as dog with a ball. Plus I assume that gravitation of the nearest to Akuma planets have its effects too. And that creates unpredictable tides. Well...

Besides, BD has an electromagnetic field (EMF), and, considering the mass of BD I suggest that it's massive and powerful as fuck. Akuma is big enough to have its own EMF, and I suggest that interaction of two EMFs creates interesting effects. I just hope that they are not deadly for the planet's life and most importantly - intelligent life.

Well. BDs EMF protects Akuma from dangerous cosmic stuff and first of all - RD's solar storms. And aurora borealis everywhere!!! Sick waves of light across the skies almost everyday! I don't know if there can be some pattern of aurora's appearance so I just assume it's an unpredictable phenomenon. I think it's possible to see other similar phenomena here. I mean, phenomena with electromagnetic and/or electric nature. Ball lightning for example, sprites and so on. And that stuff is really frequent here. 

Because of the powerful presence of EMF it's quite hard to establish a high technological civilization on Akuma. Well, tbh it's impossible. Electromagnetic storms and stuff. It could look pretty in the skies but, you know, EMF kills all electronics here. I have plot trope with aliens that come to this planet long time ago and got fucked up by it. 

I suppose that local plant and animal life found some ways to use EMF for themselves. Like, for example, predators that can find prey by electric signals, or plants or mushrooms that use electromagnetic induction for its benefit.

Oh. I need to say that because of BD's EMF Akuma's polar regions are terrible for living. U know - it's like life in Chornobyl zone but worse. Polar regions are much more affected by EMF than others, so not many things can live here.

I suppose that the temperature of BD has some effect on Akuma too but, considering the nature of those objects and its evolution, I suggest, it's not so big. But, who knows? It's still quite a big relatively warm object, not an actual star though, but, well, it makes Akuma warmer than it could be.

And I have more!

Another distinctive feature of Akuma are its mushrooms. Giant mushrooms, actually. Well, I just slightly OBSESSED(!!!) with mushrooms so Akuma has different forms and types of them. 

I suppose I can justify its size by the environmental conditions of Akuma. You know, all those volcanoes release a lot of carbon material. CO2 at least. Mushrooms store it in their mycelium. Plus, well, maybe some of them have symbiotic relationships with some bacteria/cyanobacteria and/or lichen. And maybe volcanic emissions can be used by mushrooms quite well as ""food"". 

Mushrooms here create quite a wide and deep web of mycelium. I mean, this network may be stretching under the entire surface of the planet. This network is one of the main reasons why life is possible here despite all those shit as fucking volcanos with toxic gases and high as fuck greenhouse effect. I need to say that even in the earliest stages of worldbuilding when I didn't really know what kind of world I was trying to create, I had this idea of some ""World Tree"", though, ""dark"" variant of it. So this mycelium network is Akuma's ""World Tree"", Yggdrasil-like entity, though it is mushroom and it's mostly horizontal, plus kinda growing down - to the depths.

And now I go to the most problematic element of this world - this element is the main reason for my doubts and unproductive overthinking. Climate system of Akuma.

You know, our climate depends mostly on Earth's axis, so seasons exist because the axis is changing its incline through the year. Because of the short orbital period and strong gravitation of BD, the axial tilt of Akuma is 0. Maybe I should change the axial tilt of BD so it can change the orbital incline of all its satellites? Well, no. The orbital period of BD is shorter than Earth's, and its orbit is round almost perfectly because of it. I mean - seasonal changes on Akuma could still be quite unrecognizable even if BD has a bigger axial tilt. Plus - the big axial tilt of BD and its ""moons"" makes the whole system really unstable so everything just flies in different directions after several dozen years. 

Did I say I made modeling in Universe Sandbox?

So, our more ""traditional"" climate system doesn't work here on Akuma. I mean, in normal realistic conditions Akuma's climate is quite unchangeable, without seasons. Well, sometimes volcanic winter/s happens. Though it's unpredictable. And it's sooo boring!!! Fucking eternal summer!!! But I, seemingly, found a way!

Let's go back to the mushrooms! And to the volcanos! So, as it was said before, gravitation of BD makes Akuma fluctuate as accordion (?), because its orbit isn't perfectly round. That's create a lot of inner heat and more tectonic activity, volcanos and stuff. In turn that creates a greenhouse effect and fills the planet's atmosphere with a lot of CO2, methane and different toxic shit. 

And here mushrooms come into play! I mean - those fucking giant network of mycelium under Akuma's surface and ""normal"" mushrooms too absorb those gases, well, by using symbiotic organisms (bacteria, algae or lichen) or maybe by direct interaction of mycelium with plant roots... I don't know exactly how... 

This mycelium network protects the planet's lifeforms from dangerous greenhouse effect, stabilizes temperature and humidity and, possibly, recycles toxic elements of volcanic activity into something useful. And, moreover, mushroom-mycelium network creates seasonal changes. Somehow. And for some reason. 

I mean, this network has lifecycles that make its absorption (?) capacity sometimes worse and sometimes better so there is part of a year when greenhouse effect affects planet more and other part when it's not so bad. Well, mycelium lifecycles creates seasonal changes on Akuma. But I suppose this change is still not as drastic as Earth's so it looks like tropical seasons with small transition periods in-between. Ok. 

I hope all those bullshit is understandable enough. Akuma's climate system isn't simple. This is actually the main reason why I still can't make another step in my worldbuilding process. I need someone who can say something about it.

So, what do we have here? Planet in the strange star system, with reddish sky and red and black plants, with giant mushrooms all over the place. Volcanoes and different electromagnetic stuff happen here. And volcanic winters... Not the best place to live. If you think that this planet looks like Hell - you are right! It definitely is!

Well. That's not all. It is a fantasy setting and what a fantasy without magic? Yeap, there is magic here. Considering all BD's effects I suppose that local magic exists because of it. So here on Akuma a lot of anomalous places can be found. You know, all of this stuff with tectonic faults, ley lines, mysterious zones... So, polar regions are big fucking territories FULL of anomalies! 

All gods, spirits, demons and even souls could be considered as sentient anomalies. Well, I'm still thinking about magical stuff. I have an idea of ""Dreamlands"" or ""Dream realm"", and, well, it mostly exists in dreams (or mind) of... giant mycelium web! But almost nobody knows it. I'm not sure that fungi need sleep though... So a lot of magic is connected with sleep and dreams. But mostly with different electromagnetic shit. 

I can‚Äôt say much about Akuma‚Äôs magic system just because I still haven't come up with something interesting. 

I don't think it's time to speak about local races, history and cultures, because, again, I still have doubts about the most fundamental elements of this world. This is the reason why I made this post. Doubts. Overthinking. Inability to make any progress‚Ä¶

I hope that‚Äôs all is understandable enough. I have worked with this world since 2019 and most of the time was wasted on research and modeling. This was interesting work though, but it‚Äôs time to do something more and start write a fucking story! Well, firstly I need to build the world's history, cultures, and create interesting characters‚Ä¶ Sometimes it‚Äôs all become quite frustrating. So. What do you think?",28 Mar 2024 15:31:40,reddit

153,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1bkmg30/quality_of_life_roleplay_suggestions/,Quality of Life / Roleplay suggestions!,"As I have started playing the game again after a hiatus, I noted some things that I think should be changed in the game and would like those willing to read a wall of text to give me their thoughts on some I propose:

1. Piracy - I'm under the impression that most people here would agree that piracy in its current state is annoying to deal with. Even with starbases equipped with weaponry (which reduce piracy along a certain distance) and mercantile traditions maxed, at higher trade values you are expected to dedicate a fleet of small ships to patrol important routes. I personally think that an empire government policy that taxes your alloy production by a small % when enabled  (Or energy if megacorp to represent private police) would be a better solution. Trade heavy empires would always have it on, while an empire that needs as many alloys as possible (war), or doesn't have much trade to begin with would not dedicate resources to it. This would buff gestalts slightly and  make trade empires less annoying to play in my opinion.
2. Planet Preferences / Segregation - I think you should be allowed to restrict certain species on certain planets (at least if you have resettlement allowed as your government policy, or are xenophobic). It's annoying to have pops move to a world they aren't suited or specialized for. For example, I was playing a wide empire with synthetic robots unlocked, and had the idea of settling robots on them. I would later find biological population on these tomb worlds, but plently of robot pops on ecumenopoli / ring worlds / gaia worlds. I would have to manually resettle them to other worlds instead. It also allows for roleplay purposes (Ie, multiple sectors with different species, representing autonomous regions. As an aside, it would be neat if that was actually a feature with different effects).
3. Influence to unsettle a planet recently conquered should be removed or reduced - Conquest in this game is enjoyable enough, but dealing with the AI's planets is the worst part of it. This would be made slightly less painful if it didn't cost 200 influence to unsettle a garbage planet the AI has on a completely unbuilt world. I think for a short time period (1 - 5 years after conquest), the influence cost should be lower, as its purpose is to prevent population growth via settling and unsettling, but this isn't a problem with conquest.
4. Multiple blocker technologies should be reduced - There are many blockers in the game, most of which need a unique (!!) technology to deal with. I think that these techs should be merged into one or just rolled into terrestrial sculpting (as it's bizarre to think that an empire could terraform entire planets before dealing with large glaciers, or toxic algae). This is even more relevant now with the recent technology nerfs, and the only use I have personally had with them is to reroll techs late game.
5. Colossus Shadow - This is not my original idea but I saw someone else suggest this. It would be neat if having a colossus over a planet severely increases emigration attractiveness, and decrease stability, happiness, governing ethics attraction, and possibly even have the planet surrender given the right circumstances (as it is even more pressing than orbital bombardment). This would give the colossus a more versatile use and be fun for roleplay.
6. Displacement Purge Opinion Malus - While I do use this purge option quite a bit, I've found it a bit funny that other empires throw a fit if you do any other type of genocide, but are perfectly fine (even the fanatic xenophiles) with you expelling presumably billions of individuals from their native region. I think there should be an opinion malus with caveats - maybe xenophobic empires don't care, or organics don't care about gestalt pops, or perhaps the opinion malus should just be far less severe than the other types of genocide. I would like to remind you that forced expulsion is considered a form of genocide by the UN, as far as I know.

I have an 8.75 gallon tank with a nerite and mystery snail (who are doing well).

However, concerns persist regarding their efficacy in combating high levels of toxic pollutants, especially in industries like textiles notorious for their chemical-intensive processes.

To address these challenges, let's delve into five potent biological solutions tailored for mitigating extremely toxic pollutants in industrial wastewater:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Bioremediation Techniques:** Harnessing nature's microorganisms, bioremediation employs bacteria, fungi, or algae to break down toxic compounds into harmless substances. Its adaptability allows for targeted treatment, aligning with eco-friendly principles.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Constructed Wetlands:** Engineered wetland systems leverage natural processes to remove contaminants, utilizing microbial activity and plant uptake. Carefully curated ecosystems within these wetlands enhance water quality efficiently.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Phytoremediation:** This method utilizes plants to absorb and detoxify pollutants from wastewater. Specially selected plant species with high tolerance to toxic substances play a pivotal role in this sustainable remediation process.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Bioaugmentation:** By introducing specialized microorganisms into the treatment system, bioaugmentation enhances the breakdown of toxic compounds. These added reinforcements contribute to a more efficient and targeted pollutant removal process.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Monitoring and Adaptive Management:** Continuous monitoring is essential in addressing high toxicity challenges. Implementing adaptive management allows for real-time adjustments based on data, ensuring treatment processes remain optimised and sustainable in the long term.

By embracing these powerful biological solutions and adopting proactive monitoring practices, industries can effectively combat the harmful effects of toxic pollutants in wastewater, paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable future.",19 Mar 2024 02:24:23,reddit

Being ""born with a silver spoon in your mouth"" was such a good thing because the silver in the spoon could cut down on a little bit of illness in infancy, is my understanding of the phrase.

There's a ton of silverplate stuff out there on the secondhand market these days. It's not valuable the way solid silver stuff is. I got a smooth silver plated tray for like $8 secondhand. Smooth means that it's easy to keep clean (the ornate ones are beautiful, of course, but debris could get wedged in the designs so it's not appropriate for this application imo.)

It's a nice size, so I've been using it to stage my tox treatments. I set all the materials on top and it looks really funny: this vintage silver tray and all these needles lined up, plus gloves and alcohol in a mister bottle. I spray everything down with rubbing alcohol in a mister, use gloves and wipe them down with alcohol, and wipe my face with alcohol, as well, but I figure that having one more layer of protection is a nice idea. Those articles I read about some medspa being shut down for horrific infections scare me. I do as much as I can to keep a clean working space.

I'm not using the silver tray as a substitute for keeping a clean room. In fact, I cleaned the whole room right before I did my latest treatment. (The cat was in there jumping on surfaces before; you can't be too careful when preventing contamination from animals imo.)

Still, I think maybe this is a good idea that others might benefit from? I frequently see pieces of silver plate for sale secondhand at prices lower than a fast food order for one.

Leading to a surge of algae and zero plants to filter the water, so it becomes an acidic and toxic mess. Leading to fish kills and unsafe, uninhabitable water.

2: Build man made lakes to filter water, using the same plants you killed in the first place, but at a smaller scale that doesn‚Äôt reverse the damage already caused. 

3: Release all of your Lake O toxic water into the ocean, turning it green, and like we see all over the place, kill endangered sawfish, mass fish kills, and the same headline every year ‚Äúresidents concerned over Lake O water releases‚Äù. 
It‚Äôs a money wheel. Pay people to spray (2.5 million), buy land and hire people to build ponds to hold filter (Hydrilla and other plants), put 2 million TAXPAYER dollars (REAL!) into researching why the fish are dying. 

People fail to see the problem at the source they wait to long until it is effecting their precious ocean. If they stop spraying the Lake, let vegetation grow, let it naturally filter the Lake, no more problems. Hydrilla is, in my experience, the #1 aquatic filter you can have, utilize it, it‚Äôs almost to late.
The problem is not sugar cane burning, not boaters complaining about vegetation getting in their prop, it is solely the spraying of Lake O.

Alternative forms like mechanical harvesting are a drastically better way to deal with weeds, instead of killing the plants they can be dried and turned into compost, feed, something that is productive.

I couldn't help but anxiously tap my claws together as I stared at the screen before me. Over the course of the last twenty days, Deklin had assembled a communication array as it was detailed in the data drive the humans had passed along. It was in the far edge of our territory, angled to reach one of their distant relays on the other side of the hostile stretch of space between us. It's trajectory avoided areas we knew the Arxur were residing in, but the design relied mostly on minimal bandwidth to minimize the chances of it being picked up anyway.

Speech to text was the smallest data packets we could send, and it also made it possible for us to communicate, since the friendly humans didn't have translator technology built yet. We passed along the proper data so they could decipher our scripts, and within the day the prime minister was having uncomfortable but otherwise productive conversations with them. Why our translators were already familiar with their language was a question that had been bothering me, and after doing some digging Laripo had found out exactly why that was the case.

The humans were not a new species, after all. They were a violent species, once compared to the Arxur. And somehow none of what we read or passed on to the representatives matched our treatment when we stumbled onto their doorstep asking for help. The most perplexing thing that we found was at some point the Federation thought the humans blew themselves up. There was some ancient news headlines that had noted rising tensions between world powers at the time, so I could imagine that the extermination fleet that was being assembled took a deep breath and sighed when they recorded several nuclear detonations. It seemed like Earth had reached the conclusion of its conflict, like its very own articles had been predicting.

I was glad whoever was in charge of those sensors never did a follow up.

As it stood, somehow the Combine had convinced Deklin to go through with an exchange that I never could have predicted. He had set up a data drop containing defensive platform technology, detailed historical records of the war, the plights the Cradle, Leirn, and Fahl, and maps of the known galaxy. There was likely a lot more information in the data drop that I was not aware of, but it wasn't my business to know what was in the data drop. Whatever it contained had been vetted and approved by Viggo and Glycid, the Yotul and Harchen representatives, respectively.

Their presence in the room wasn't what was filling me with the intrusive thought to run away.

What had me on edge was Deklin wanted them to come pick it up.

In the last week, the prime minister had found a decently sized docking station meant for off planet storage and distribution. Where he got it from, I had no idea. He'd also sat it at the edge of our territory, where it would be safe to excise if we were invaded in an act of betrayal. It was out of sight and out of mind for the entire Union, but if a firefight broke out it would be dealt with quickly.

Alas, it was not likely to come to that or none of the other representatives would be here. Casting a brief glance at Deklin, I wasn't certain if he would be here either, or if he'd daringly face the risk anyways head on.

The prime minister was hesitant to give them warp drives or anything they could use to mass produce FTL technology so soon in our talks, but he'd been talked into lending some older Gojid freighters. My team had piloted three of the average sized ships back across hostile territory for them, and we'd returned in a small cruiser we had strapped down in one of the ships. Not empty handed, thankfully.

The Combine had insisted that it would be best that they traverse the dangerous territory so none of our people would be at risk. They were banking heavily on the Arxur being gentle to them if they were caught, since they were fellow predators. I doubted it would matter what they were if the Arxur saw a Gojid ship in their territory, but there was some honor in taking the risk off of our shoulders and making it so Deklin didn't have to risk any more lives than necessary.

The truth was, this was how we would know if they were trustworthy enough to work with. They didn't have time to rip the warp drive out of any of those ships and put them back in before the first drop, and we'd lent them out in the first place with a firm request to not tamper with anything. If all three ships returned, then we would know that they were good with their word.

I wasn't certain if I should pray that this went well. I wasn't certain if I *could* pray for the humans. It was strange. Looking at Deklin again, I couldn't even begin to understand how he looked so reserved and not even slightly conflicted. What kind of punishment would the Great Protector have for us for doing this? Would she approve? Was a friendly predator even such a thing that could be accepted by her? We were doing this for the greater good of the herd, she had to understand that much.

There were whispers that she was growing ill. The priests didn't want to talk about it, but the lands were starting to weaken. Pests were growing more and more abundant, and there was uncertainty if scorching the lands to remove the greatest concentrations of them only made her worse. It hurt every time it happened, and her tears could only do so much to wash away the scars. Many pointed to the build up of algae blooms and contaminated reservoirs as proof that there was sickness in her tears and that we were hurting her, but nobody knew what to do.

It was a tragedy, and worse yet the practice failed consistently. It was only a short term solution, and it would ruin the land for the growing season while the surviving pests would just migrate to the next field, then the next. Their numbers would replenish, and then another burn would need to happen. The vermin were the worst offenders, and there was harsh disagreements on whether or not using poison would solve the problem or hurt the Protector even more. The idea ended up being scrapped, and Exterminators had to take on additional responsibilities culling the swarms with traps and dedicated teams. It didn't feel like they were making a difference at all, and only in the past few decades did a more sinister threat arise that forced us down the trail we walked currently.

Aided by migrating vermin, a fungus infection had rapidly spread across the globe and directly impacted major staple grains. Originally held at bay with sprays and treatments, a formidable group of the diseases surpassed the treatments and was spread by commerce and spores that clung to the fur and carapace of the vermin that migrated to fresher farms. It bloomed everywhere, and even made it to two other colony planets before we caught on and frantically locked down shipping before it could spread. Regulations were strengthened with an iron grasp, but at that point it was too late.

Attempts to find a stronger treatment for the blight didn't bare fruit until crop yields had diminished by a third, and the people were scared and desperate by then. The treatments worked on only a few strains of the fungus, which brought us back from collapse but didn't solve our crisis. The unaffected strains were still a threat, and many small farms could only stop the disease from spreading by burning their yields to protect the plots that were still uncontaminated. Countless greenhouses that had better protection still were not safe from vermin bringing things in, and a few had to be torched and rebuilt when fumigations failed to keep the fungus from taking root.

Subsidized hydroponics farms were the most secure agriculture assets we had, and were what got us through the worst of the blight. The Fissians had weaseled their way into contracts with them and were frequently playing on our strife to sell us parts and equipment for them, and under the extreme pressure from the famine the Gojid union had slowly been caving and sourcing equipment from the commercial titan.

That pressure got worse when news broke that somehow, several farms were compromised and their harvests ruined. Their prices rose to offer consultation and resources for additional sites, but they were hefty and we still had options.

We were lucky that our blight couldn't affect alien crops, but once more the cost to import was egregious. We were not the only people with famine. Fahl had locust swarms so thick that farming outdoors wasn't possible anymore, and the insects on their planet were highly toxic things that could kill you in moments, if you accidentally ingested contaminated food. Their insecticides only worked for a few years at a time, forcing their exterminators to spend weeks at a time culling the swarms themselves.

Gilead had claimed to have heard whispers that there was legislation being quietly considered to use warheads to cleanse entire swaths of heavily infested land in an attempt to flatten the curve of their exponential growth. Everything living was being eaten, and the sands were getting worse as the environment was steadily picked clean of everything that could keep their soil stable.

There were other planets struggling with similar plights. Yields crippled by diseases, resilient insects, prey overtaking the lands. There were plenty of planets that were still healthy and offering aid, but fear was abundant. Nobody wanted their planet to be next to be struck down by disaster, and that affected how tightly some species would hold onto their resources, just in case. Nobody wanted to end up like the Paltans, after all.

There were some species that all but vanished as time went on. If it wasn't for the Letians showing up at the Galactic Assembly each year, I wouldn't even know that they existed. They were heavy isolationists, and were of no help to anyone. The Leshee were similar, but unlike the Letians people wanted to bother them for resources. When a small coalition of representatives tried to force the Leshee representative to cave to their requests a few years back, the amphibian had icily warned them that they were more than capable of pushing back armed invaders, Arxur or otherwise.

I don't think anyone even knew if those two were doing okay or not. They didn't reach out to anyone as far as I was aware, and nobody wanted to reach out to them either.

I felt something on my foot and looked down, suddenly aware that Gilead limped up beside me and had loosely draped her tail across it to get my attention. I didn't know her before our fated trip, but I'd grown to consider her a friend in that short time. I was glad to see she was looking far healthier, and no longer had that medical band on her arm. It was just a normal wrapping now, lightly tied over scales that visibly shined better and better with each day.

""Are you okay?"" She quietly chirped.

""I am. I don't know how this is going to go, or if the Great Protector is going to punish us for trying this or forsake us if it succeeds."" I whispered, anxiously tapping at the console. ""It's insane, but this could change everything if it goes right. That's worth the risk.""

Gilead touched my side in understanding, but I ignored it. She didn't seem to comprehend the fact that is was predators that saved her life. I had a feeling that she didn't believe us; I couldn't fault her for that. Predators were the source of so much pain in the galaxy, and she'd been unconscious during our stay while we were questioned and taken care of. By all accounts she should never have woke up again. None of us should be standing here.

I rested my claws on the console, forcing them to be still.

And yet, we were. How did the Protector do that? Did she see how these humans composed themselves and bent over backward to try and make us feel more at ease? Deception would have ended when we went before the Combine's council, so they had been genuine. Did she see their honesty? Where they anything she had seen before, where a predator could be honest and caring?

The representatives were talking in hushed whispers with Prime Minister Deklin. Laripo was off on her own, intently watching the large monitor over my head that displayed the wide, barren floor of the storage room. At the far end was the one docking port that we didn't disable. We could have had all three ships board at once, but the image of being mobbed was one nobody could comfortably ignore. One at a time was the best option for both parties.

Dr. Kramer was here, but he was even more withdrawn than Laripo. He wanted nothing to do with this, but he couldn't stand letting everyone else be here without him. He had the worst experience with the humans, and refused to talk about whatever happened while that human cub had paraded him around. He looked outright miserable and sick, and it didn't slip past me that he was standing closest to a trash bin for a reason. I'd hide there too, if I was that small.

Glycid's scales were changing colors frequently, shifting through a mirage of distressed signals. ""Do we know how fast their industry is? What if they took the warp drives out of those ships and put them in their warships? They could cripple the Union with one heavy blow!""

Deklin didn't look humored. Neither did Viggo, who was the most reserved out of all of us. ""Three ships wouldn't be able do that.""

""Even your primitive constructs can destroy an Arxur ship, and we're all here without any defenses!"" The harchen's quip made me wince, and Laripo's ears dropped slightly. The yotul representative was much less forgiving, however, and hostility edged into his voice.

""*They* don't know that it's *us* on this station. Attacking this place would not guarantee any strategic victory, and lead to the destruction of the only technology they have to reach us.""

""But what if they took this time to figure out how the ftl drives work? They could be sending over an entire armada, and hit your people where they least expect it!""

Deklin put a paw over his snout in a rare show of irritation.

""Federation factories might be able to churn out several ftl drives a week, but the Combine neither has the infrastructure for that nor the refined resources on standby. They have three ships that can cross the distance, and even if they strapped their best weapons to them they wouldn't pose a threat beyond here. I implore that you take some time to think before you make claims like that, and especially if you think insulting your peers will get you any favors.""

Glycid's scales discolored in frustration and embarrassment, and Viggo subtly flicked an ear Deklin's way in appreciation. Everyone had the right be be anxious, but turning on each other with petty insults wasn't the time.

The yotul representative tapped his foot on the floor, getting their attention before he spoke. ""Now, before Glycid's *rational* outburst got away from himself, I wanted to discuss distribution of whatever's brought here today."" He started, still sounding reserved and collected despite the jab at the harchen representative.

""Given the strict oversight the Nevok and Fissans have on Leirn, I don't have a way to smuggle any assets to my people without being noticed. At least not yet. With that in mind, my people are fairing better than the both of yours. I'm going to lend my portion of the exchange to Fahl, as they need it the most.""

Glycid looked taken back, wide eyed at the offer. His gaze fell to the floor after a moment, and he spoke softly: ""Thank you.""

Deklin offered Viggo a respectful ear flick, before clearing his throat. ""I made a request for some refined minerals as well. If they can pass the purity tests, they can be used for medication. We won't need to bother the Zurulians, or have to be forced to deal with the Fissans for a few weeks.""

""How much did you ask for?"" Viggo inquired, giving the prime minister a strange look. Deklin remained impassive, but after a moment he sighed.

""Probably more than I should have."" He admitted. ""But if the Combine can supply it, it'll give us some information on their industrial status. We could open up trade, in the future.""

I looked down at the console, noting the time. I started tapping my claws again as I looked up at the monitor. There would be three blips soon. Three ships arriving at the edge of our territory when the humans would arrive.

And then, there they were.",17 Mar 2024 06:19:47,reddit

Vitamin D3 is the more natural form because it's the form made by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight. It is found in small amounts in some foods, but the vitamin D3 used in supplements mostly comes from lanolin (a fatty substance sourced from sheep's wool).

Vitamin D2 is sourced from plants, such as mushrooms. Although it is vegan, vitamin D2 isn't as effectively absorbed or used by the body as the D3 form.

But vegans don't have to settle for the less potent D2 form because there is also plant-sourced vitamin D3.

Vegan vitamin D3 is derived from lichen (an organic substance formed by algae and fungi).

Three of the best vegan vitamin D (D3) supplement brands are Sports Research, MRM Nutrition, and Country Life. Both Sports Research and MRM offer D3 + K2, while Country Life is just D3.

It's recommended to take vitamin K2 with vitamin D because these two work together in the body, and vitamin K2 helps combat vitamin D toxicity.",12 Mar 2024 22:49:13,reddit

**Continued From Part 6**

Donner ducked out of the tent before Drelloc could ask him what he had meant and quickly made his way to the far side of the boulder they had used for that night‚Äôs shelter.  After a second to empty his bladder against a convenient scrub brush, Donner made his way over to the small handful of stones he had used to anchor the tarp down against the everpresent wind of Minasdee.

Untying them only took seconds as he had not used tight knots.  It hadn‚Äôt been that big of a concern to him that they stay secure for a long time.  They had only needed to last over the single night after all.  He kicked the stones back into the shadow of the rock as each was liberated from their coils.  Soon he was done and heading back towards the camp after having tossed the small topes back over the top of the toppled monolith.

He watched the alien from the corner of his vision as he worked on a quick and hearty breakfast of rehydrated MREs.  Drelloc was still struggling a bit with the ropes, but she had folded the tarp much quicker and neater than he could have managed.  Those incredibly dexterous hands of hers made short work of it and not for the first time he found himself wondering what it would be like to have two extra arms.  Hell why stop there, the vinarfel had ten arms, and fifty-some-odd legs as well to boot.

He chuckled at the thought.  What a terrible monstrosity he would be if he had anywhere near that many.  He checked the temperature of the water for the second packet and then finished up, pouring the scalding water into the small pouch and sealing it off with a vigorous shake.  The electric heater was coming incredibly handy, he was once more grateful that she had managed to get the survival duffel before the Valor had exploded.  He was not sure why Lady Luck had led him down this particular path, but he was in a way grateful for the experience.

As soon as he thought it he cursed himself though.  He had lost all his squadmates to this ranxshit mission, and the only people that he had to blame was the woman struggling with the last of the ropes in front of him.  But as he watched her he found he could not remain mad.

From what she had alluded to, this entire escort mission was not her idea and that made it a bit easier to forgive her for the disaster it had become.  All in all he found himself torn between his newfound feelings for her and his guilt for being the only survivor of the terrible calamity that had decimated his fellow soldiers.

He picked up the two packets after he finished clearing away the rest of the kitchen supplies before walking over and handing her one, they would need to get moving soon if they wanted to avoid the hottest part of the day later.  They finished their meal in contented silence, only the sound of their vigorous chewing punctuating the steady breeze that whipped through their camp.

Donner stood and looked around before reaching out for Drelloc‚Äôs trash.  She looked at him curiously till she understood and he packed it up in a side pocket of the duffel.  The world was suffering enough from the war without their litter cluttering things up on top of it.

‚ÄúI feel much better than I did yesterday morning.‚Äù  She said, causing him to turn his head to look at her curiously.  ‚ÄúI am still very sore, and in many places I didn‚Äôt even know I could get sore.  But I don't feel so.. untuned?  Is that the right way to say it?‚Äù  She seemed at a loss for words.

Donner hefted the duffel and his rifle before answering.  He let out a heavy sigh as the weight settled firmly upon his shoulders.  ‚ÄúWell I suppose if you are anything like me, you are building new muscles.  This usually takes a while to really start having an effect, but you should notice some pretty immediate results when doing any kind of prolonged strenuous activity.‚Äù  He watched as she made a gesture he was unfamiliar with.  He supposed from the context that it could have meant anything from disbelief to puzzlement.  But it flashed by before he had the chance to ask properly.  He just suited himself by nodding at her.

He shifted and then glanced out into the near distance.  He checked his wrist worn assistant and then nodded in the direction they needed to tread.  ‚ÄúWe need to make another five kilometers before midday.  If we keep focused I think we should be able to make it with little issue.‚Äù

Drelloc hopped from foot to foot as she responded sullenly, ‚ÄúAnd here I was hoping that we would need to swim today.‚Äù

He understood her sullen attitude, but he also knew that dwelling on the negative would drain both of their morale.  He needed to make sure he kept her focused on their goals, not just the next step in their admittedly half-assed plan.

He started to walk, pausing for only a moment to let her catch up to him.  Once more he was struck by her strange and frankly rather alien gait.  The way all four legs seemed to move independently of each other and yet she remained both sure footed and steady.  He glanced away before the slightly confusing display made him lose his own footing.

He swallowed a swig of water from his waterpack, the water was still a little cool from last night‚Äôs chill air and the cool liquid helped to ease the soreness in his throat.  He had expected their ordeal last night to bring them closer, but if anything she was feeling a little more aloof than the night before.  An undeniable tension had arisen between them, it had started the day before but had increased threefold overnight.

Donner glanced towards the alien woman again, trying to be as casual as possible.  One of her many eyes seemed to be fixed on him, the bright red eye flicking away as he saw it.  Had he just imagined it?  He was driving himself crazy thinking about it.

Surely she must feel something for him, she had acted in a manner that suggested it.  But then again she hadn't said anything concrete, and neither had he.  Maybe she was simply waiting for him to make the first move.  Was her species more or less assertive as females, he just didn‚Äôt know.

He almost fell flat on his face as his preoccupied mind missed an ancient dried root on the ground.  As his foot hit it he yelled out and stumbled forwards, he managed to catch himself on a nearby boulder.

Drelloc rushed to his side and reached out but stopped before touching him, her arms pulling back as he stood up wincing.  ‚ÄúAre you alright, Donner!  I.. good.‚Äù  She cut herself off.

He rubbed his shoulder painfully, at least one muscle in it had been wrenched painfully as he had stopped his fall.  He nodded to Drelloc, ‚ÄúYes, thank you.  We need to be careful up ahead, let's take a short break.‚Äù

She nodded silently and scuttled a half a meter away before settling down to the rapidly heating earth.  She rubbed her arms and seemed content to simply observe her surroundings.  Donner gave a small sigh, here it was again.  That strange tension, almost as if a frozen cord was wrapped around them.  They couldn't get too close together, neither could they move far apart without being pulled together again.

It was near maddening so he did the only thing he could think of.  He pulled out the small piece of wood again and started to whittle at it carefully.  He had always gone back to his age old hobby when his nerves started to betray him, the slow methodical maneuvers of the blade as it coaxed the form hidden amongst the grain served to calm his mind like nothing else.  He supposed it had something to do with past trauma and suppressed childhood memories.  Or so the shrinks said.

He heard a scuffling noise but didn't look up from his work, choosing rather to remain fully absorbed in the process.  His deft strokes carved out several deep channels in the rectangular blank and then linked the channels together in several key places.  The form he sought beginning to take shape.

Before he did any more work on it he closed his knife with a snap causing Drelloc, who had in the intervening time scooted much closer, to jump to a standing position with a small yelp of surprise.

He pocketed the small piece of wood and rubbed his hands together.  He gave her a look and then spoke, ‚ÄúAlright, good enough.  Okay, the plan is to cut through the leftmost side of the beachhead zone.  It's a dangerous area so you need to keep your wits about you.‚Äù

Before he could say more she rattled off, ‚ÄúDiamonomolecular razor wire, duracrete pitfalls, unexploded munitions, biological contaminants, toxic mires, artillery craters filled with razor sharp shrapnel, mine fields, underground tunnels and the still burning wrecks of downed assault dropships.. to name a few.‚Äù  She smiled, her eyes crinkling in that manner he was beginning to recognise.

He nodded.  ‚ÄúYeah, stuff like that.  How did you..‚Äù

Drelloc looked at him and waved a few arms in that same old way.  ‚ÄúI may not be a field agent, but data collection and battlefield intelligence is my specialty.  And I have quite a bit of accumulated data on no man's land.‚Äù

Donner nodded.  ‚ÄúOkay.  Good.  Well, stick close then.  You can read all you want about punji-pits and shell craters, but it won't give you the hands-on experience you need to avoid them properly.  He smiled slightly as she nodded with her hands, her eyes maintaining that sheer focus that he sometimes found alluring and other times so unsettling.

Turning back towards the land in front of them he could just make out the first few dark wisps of smoke on the horizon.  A bad sign that they were headed in the right direction.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Drelloc was fuming inside.  What was she doing, why couldn't she just tell the man what she felt?

But what did she feel?  She didn't even know what to tell herself, much less the focus of her fascination.  She knew that what she was feeling was some form of physical and emotional attraction, he made her feel safe.  Safe in a way that she had never felt before.  He had also helped her to finally come to terms with her other selves and reached balance in life that she had been lacking for as long as she could remember.

For that alone the man deserved her gratitude, and a medal.  But for saving her life multiple times on top of that.. She shook an arm that he couldn't see. The need to express herself was powerful enough that she couldn't fully contain it.

She had also not failed to notice that he had been eating all of the rations she had expressed her dislike of.  They had stopped for lunch and she had once more been given a chicken dish, this one had been called spicy chicken alfredo with brawklun.  She had quite enjoyed it, especially the strange reddish chunks of vegetable.

When she looked back over at the human he was once more carving that small piece of wood.  She didn't fully understand its purpose, she had gathered that it was a form of catharsis for him, but as to its deeper meaning she was as of yet unenlightened.  He had mentioned something about his father making carvings for his siblings as a child, but she didn't quite understand the appeal.

Maybe it wasn't about logic she realised.  Maybe it was simply a means of pushing the world away for a few precious minutes.  She herself liked to read as a manner of destressing from the world.  Great works by famous writers such as Ineen Aldrop and Jaclin Forrester came to mind.

Drelloc stepped over another large rock and observed her surroundings.  She felt one of her eyes focus on Donner and did her best to draw it away, but part of her just kept on moving it back towards him.  She brushed herself off with two arms as she tried to regain a little of her internal composure.  She needed to pay attention to their surroundings as he had warned, they were coming up on dangerous territory.

Indeed the curls of drifting smoke drew nearer with every step and she was beginning to detect something foul upon the wind.  Donner had given her a level four multispecies respirator almost half an hour ago, the contraption strapping over her mouth and helping to filter the air.  Her gills were still exposed on the underside of her head, but she did her best to keep them closed.  Both as protection from the growing heat of the day as well as to protect them from potential irritants.

Minasdee didn't rain much, the entire world being covered in arid scrubland and low grasslands near the poles.  As such the toxins of war were never washed away, instead they simply got concentrated by the heat and wind till there were places on the planet as dangerous as any radiological disaster site.

She knew that Donner was keeping an eye out for such pitfalls.  She watched as the human swept around in front of them with a small multitector tool, likely looking out for just such kinds of hotspots and poor air pockets.  The last thing they needed was to stumble into some noxious cloud of synthetic plastic degrading bacteria or something similarly nasty.

Biological weapons without limited lifespans or kill switches were prohibited for use in conflict by both sides as per the codes of war.  But this war had seen the rules stretched to the breaking point on both sides.  She herself had been disgusted to learn of the events that had happened in the Karax system.  Union sources vehemently denied involvement in the tragedy that had seen the destruction of an entire world without a trace.  But the Rebels had evidence to strongly suggest that they had nothing to do with it.

She only knew that the Union Science Division was running top secret experiments out of there, but that was the extent of her knowledge.  For all she knew the Union had been responsible for the deaths of those millions.  And if that were true then part of her would not even have been surprised.

She grimaced, her mouth twitching under the respirator she wore.  Those at the top would do anything to maintain their status.  She had found evidence of other things, things she dared not even think of lest they detect her in a lie during one of the UIA‚Äôs monthly loyalty inspections.

She was about to ask for them to take a short breather when Donner stopped suddenly, she didn't quite get the memo and took another step before she was grabbed and halted by the man forcefully.

She gulped in indignation as he hauled her backwards another step.  ‚ÄúHey, what's the big idea..‚Äù  He shushed her loudly and pointed ahead.

She looked and then froze.  The ground in front of them was glass smooth and perfectly uniform in color.  Out of the corner of her eye she had not even noticed the difference, but now that he had pointed it out it seemed startlingly out of place.

Donner leaned down and picked up a small stone from the ground.  He gave her a pointed look and then tossed it.  It sailed through the air before landing square in the muck with a loud ‚ÄòPloop!‚Äô  before sinking completely out of sight, barely a blemish on the surface of the quagmire to even show that it had gone in.

Drelloc shuddered and stepped back a pace.  She hadn‚Äôt even seen the danger.  Once more she owed the tall human her life.  She gestured to the deadly morass before them, ‚Äúwe need to find another way around.  What about that?‚Äù  She gestured towards what looked to be a collapsed trenchworks nearby.  The wooden gangplanks that allowed for passage over the flooded mire were still in place.

Donner gave her a nod.  ‚ÄúOkay, but I am going first.  If anything happens to me I want you to trek south.  There should be another way around that will add a day or two to the journey.‚Äù  He paused and then unslung the duffel from his back.  ‚ÄúHere, take this Drelloc.  You need to make it back to base.‚Äù

She grabbed it with three arms and then slung it over her shoulders as Donner walked out onto the gangplank.  It seemed to wobble slightly but held firm as he stepped across the wide quagmire filled trench.  She slowly and gingerly followed suit, her body rebelling against her by trembling in mild fear.  The thought of that dark mass consuming her, of her mouth and eyes filling with cloying toxic mud, it shook her in a way that she was scarcely willing to admit to even herself.

She crossed the patch without incident and lept into Donner‚Äôs outstretched arm.  Her body pressing into his for a brief moment as he steadied her.  Was it simply her imagination or did he linger close to her for longer than was necessary.  Almost too quick to notice he stepped away.

‚ÄúWe need to move faster.  I don't want to be caught in this hellhole when night falls.  Sleeping in a mask is uncomfortable at the best of times, and these are far from ideal circumstances.‚Äù

She gestured in an understanding manner.  She couldn't exactly smell the area around her in the same manner that he could, but her receptors were picking up many decidedly unpleasant notes drifting through the fetid air of the debris riddled battlefield.  She followed him slowly, making sure to match his every step.  They would be through this nightmare soon enough, she screwed several eyes shut, for once not wanting to be able to observe the entirety of her surroundings.  Instead she decided to focus on Donner‚Äôs back, the man leading her inexorably through the choking bog.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The going was slow and tedious, Donner making sure to use the multitector and his assistant to their fullest effect.  Steering their path as far from the worst of the irradiated zones where the charred remains of armoured vehicles lay.  The ground was soft, clay and sand left over from the construction of the subterranean fortifications that had made up the first lines of defense.

He shook his head and tried to ignore the scaling sun that beat relentlessly upon his back.  He spared a glance at his companion, the razah‚Äôvoolian woman teetering along behind him.  Her strange alien form no longer quite so unfamiliar in his mind, he couldn't help but give her a reassuring smile and was pleased to see the skin around her secondary eyes crease in return.  Her own version of the gesture.

He suppressed a cough and shook his head.  The damn gas mask was supposed to be fog-proof, but he found that the eye pieces kept misting with his labored breathing.  He swore quietly under his breath and then stopped dead, his body tensing.

Directly in front of them was a deep impact crater, the trench having smashed asunder by the impact of some manner of dropship.  What had gotten his attention however  were the multitude of screaming corpses that littered the ground around the site.  Their bodies were charred, rotting flesh sloughing from shattered bone in the algae filled slime at the bottom of the hole.

He felt his gorge rise and had to double over, he had seen death before.  Many times in fact, he was a soldier.  But to imagine the manner in which these doomed soul‚Äôs had died, screaming in agony as the burning fuel of their wrecked ship drowned them in toxic vapors.  He shuddered, his eyes screwing shut at the horror of it.

He felt a trio of arms on his back after a moment, not condescending or pushing.  But gentle, comforting.  He heard a soft whisper, Drelloc speaking in reverence at her witness of the sight.  ‚ÄúThere is no compensation for their deaths.  But we can at least make sure they are avenged, when this war is over they will be buried with honor Donner.  It is the least they are owed for their sacrifice.‚Äù

He knew the words were meant to sooth him, but he felt a white hot anger in his heart as she spoke them.  He stood slowly, a fist raised hateful to the sky as he raged, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point of it all!  We die like znots in a box for the honor of gutless cowards and corrupt politicians!‚Äù  Once more he was comforted by a pair of arms on his shoulders.  He stifled a sob that tried to tear its way from his breast and looked down at one of her hands.

She seemed to hesitate and then released him.  ‚ÄúI understand Donner.  I truly do, but things won't change while the war yet rages.  We need to keep moving, as you said.  Please.‚Äù

Donner stood, his hands shaking and his vision a bit grey.  He took a deep shuddering breath, the rage simmering just under the surface.  He shouldn't be mad at her, she had nothing to do with the war and his own current sorry situation on a backwater planet with no backup.  No, he needed to direct his anger towards the real assholes in charge.

He nodded his head and turned to look at Drelloc.  She took an uncertain looking step back as he let out the breath he had been holding explosively and gestured towards the left.  ‚ÄúWe can move around the.. wreckage.  We should be able to make better time once we reach the secondary lines, they were less damaged in this area if memory serves.‚Äù

He turned from her before she could speak and started to pick his way across the edge of the hole, skirting the crater so as to not have to cross back into the mud that lay to either side.  This took them deeper into the hostile territory of the wrecked defense line.

Donner scanned the ground with his eyes as his other senses remained on high alert.  He might not have the same constant all around peripheral vision that Drelloc had, but from what he had read as a younger man humans had exceptional binocular vision for an omnivorous species.  The yeown had better vision in the dark and the slaaveth could see further under the water, but these specialties were outmatched in broad daylight on land.

He saw something that made his heart freeze and threw out an arm in the universal motion for halt.  In front of them was a series of small impact craters, several of which had small fins protruding from them.  They were unexploded bomblets from some manner of cluster munitions, incredibly dangerous as they may still be live.

He gestured to them and commented, ‚ÄúUnexploded bombs ahead.  We need to find another way, it's far too dangerous to risk weaving through.  A single vibration may be all that they require to detonate.  He and Drelloc turned and made their way across a nearby spit of land that jutted out into the crater strewn no man‚Äôs land between trenchworks.

The going was slow, every step fraught with peril, every breath labored by the knowledge of the terrible danger that lay all around.  Donner could feel the stress as it tensed his muscles and froze the blood to ice in his veins.  He stumbled and nearly fell, catching himself against a metal spar that jutted from the dry, cracked mud.  Looking back towards what had caught his foot he swallowed heavily, jutting from the ground was the barely recognisable form of a heavy machine gun.  The boxy shape rusted and looking completely ruined.

He checked his surroundings and then noted that Drelloc was stumbling slightly as well, he leaned against the metal bar and motioned for her to halt.

He nodded and then rested his hands on his knees.  ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a second to breathe.‚Äù

She made a tired looking gesture, part affirmative and slightly worried.  The way her blood red eyes seemed to take in everything made him acutely aware of the awful situation they were immersed in.  He felt the urge to reach out to her, to steady and comfort her, but he stopped himself.  He was her guardian, her protector.  He couldn't be more than that, not without getting too closely involved emotionally.

He shut his eyes and tried to block out the moaning of the wind as it blew steadily over the area.  It reminded him of the sounds that the old factory near to his childhood home made, the groaning of large things rubbing together.  He smiled slightly, the memories of his childhood managing to bring  a small measure of comfort to his ailing soul.  After another few minutes he had them move out once more, he honestly felt a little bit better now and it manifested as a little extra pep in his step.  His stride was a bit more assured, though he still kept vigilant of their surroundings.

He slowed as they neared another smouldering wreck, the burnt out hull of an armoured vehicle causing his multitector to spike.  The rapid clicking screeching danger signals at him as a gust of wind blew some of the thin white smoke their way.  Even months later the tank was still hot, likely due to some manner of low level fission reactions taking place in its ruptured promethium powercells.

He nodded to Drelloc and they made their way around the hulk.  Its thick metal plates twisted by the impact of something that had nearly turned it inside out.  Likely some manner of very large orbital or long range bombardment judging by the vitrified looking soil that spread from under its twisted form.

‚ÄúThis way, quickly.  That thing is pretty hot still.‚Äù  He gestured to Drelloc who followed along behind him, her pace definitely a little slower than it had been earlier.  She was getting tired, he needed to find a safe place to rest more substantially.

He looked around but saw nothing but more destitute cratered landscape, overflowing with pitfalls and discarded detritus of battle.  More than a few rotten bodies littered the space as well, neither side willing to brave the toxic swamps to bury their disgraced dead.

He kept moving along the side of this new embankment, trying to find a place where they could at least pause to hunker down without seemingly absorbing pollutants or stray radiation.  He scrambled up a crater in the earthen wall while motioning for Drelloc to stay put.

Donner reached the top without incident and ducked under a stray loop of razorwire to get his bearings again.  He noted with relief that they were nearly through.  The Beachhead was wide, extending for dozens of kilometers both to the north and south, but it was not terribly deep.  They had nearly pushed through, only a few hundred more meters of twisted and collapsed earthworks and they would be free of its ilk.  And good thing too, it was starting to get late in the day, the oppressive sun was dipping towards the horizon like some great glowing eye and he could feel the heat slowly leaching out of the planet‚Äôs atmosphere.  The lack of greenhouse gasses and cloud cover making the planet radiate off most of the day‚Äôs heat relatively fast.

Donner looked around quickly, trying to assess the best route to safety.  It looked like they could keep moving along the embankment for another few meters and then push through a breach close to the wreckage of another dropship.  From there it was a relatively straight shot to safety.

He scrambled down the wall and looked at her, ‚ÄúWe are close.  Another few hundred meters Drelloc.  You can do this.‚Äù

She made an unknowable gesture and seemed to slump slightly.  Donner twitched, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how.  After a moment of indecision he decided to risk it and reached out, placing a firm hand on one of her shoulders.

Drelloc looked up at his touch, her smaller secondary eyes widening slightly, the crinkling of the skin around them forming a strange expression he couldn't decipher.  She made another gesture with two of her arms while a third reached up to cover his hand with one of her own.  Her skin was warm, the surface of it much softer than it looked given the grey wrinkled texture of it.  They stood like that for another moment, Donner feeling as though something unspoken had just passed between them.  An understanding of sorts.

He nodded and turned, not wanting her to see the rising color in his cheeks as they burned slightly.  She had given him that look again, the one she had given him the night before.  When she had brushed his hair.  He cleared his throat, he was a man.  He wasn‚Äôt about to admit to himself that just her touch had made his knees grow weak and his heart race like they never had before.

Donner picked up the pace slightly, not in anger, but in desperation.  He needed to get her out of here and to safety, the thought of anything happening to her.  It didn't bear thinking about.

They moved quickly over the embankment and down the other side, Donner making sure to scan the area for any threats or danger.  It wouldn't have been the first old battlefield he had been forced to scramble through, though this one was by far one of the most dangerous he had yet to encounter.  The pitfalls, the mud traps and toxic fumes all combined to make the whole place a definite deathtrap for the unwary.  Luckily the planet of Minasdee didn't seem to have much in the way of scavengers.

He perked up, he could see the end ahead, not more than seventy meters away there was a gap in the rusting razor wire and cratered trenches that led to firmer ground.  He glanced at Drelloc, the razah‚Äôvool woman was flagging.  Her strength all but spent but he saw her eyes smile as he looked at her.

‚ÄúAre we.. nearly there?‚Äù  She panted through her respirator, the slightly muffled sound of her voice still making him smile.

He turned to look forwards again and skirted what looked like a ruptured powercell on the dry ground.  ‚ÄúYes, not much longer.  We are going to rest just at the top of that hill, you see it ahead?‚Äù  He made a wide gesture forwards.

Drelloc started to speak, but her voice was cut off by a subtle noise followed by a sharp inhale from her.  He froze as the distinct sound rattled through the still air.

Click!

‚ÄòNo, nonono..‚Äô  He thought silently as he slowly turned around.  His fears were realised as he looked back and saw her standing perfectly still, all four arms up and on her head in some gesture of terror or despair.  For under one of her suited feet was a buried and dirt covered disk.  The shape of the land mine was just barely apparent through the growing dusk.

Donner doubled over as if he had been punched in the gut, the feeling of horror that permeated his middle nearly crippling in its intensity.

He felt a single tear tear its way from the corner of his eye as Drelloc spoke, her wavering voice full of fatigue and fear.  ‚ÄúDonner, what do I do?‚Äù

179,https://v.redd.it/5zymyz4pxemc1,Advice for betta fish tank üî•,"I love Bettas. My family has had them my whole life. Now, I‚Äôm at university, busy with the stresses of adult life, and (a little lonely) living in an apartment on my own. So, I got myself a crown tail a bit ago (about a year). 

My family were always good fish owners, so I know the basics (5+ gal, though my childhood fish always seemed happier in 3-5 gallons than anything above that, despite what I‚Äôve read. Heater, filter, pellets and blood worm treats, and some hidey live plants) but not much more than that. Like I said, they were great no doubt, but probably not excellent. My current goal is to be an excellent fish mom. I love my little guy. 

He has a 5 gallon tank, a filter, a heater, 2 snails, a few anubis plants, and java ferns. In addition to this, he has a betta log, a small amount of red root floaters, and a pothos plant. I hadn‚Äôt read much about pothos for bettas, other than that they weren‚Äôt toxic, and so I added a few I had been propagating, more for decoration than anything. Come to find out, he LOVES his pothos. I think that‚Äôs what made me want to really improve everything even more for him. He loves swimming through the roots. It‚Äôs so fun to watch, and I swear he gets the zoomies before or after he eats, and will swim through all the windy roots super fast before he goes back to the surface to eat more. In terms of substrate, he just has some black gravel rock, nothing crazy. 

Ok, so now, here are my suggestion requests (though any and all suggestions would be appreciated): 

1) I hate the rock substrate. It is difficult to clean, it gets dirty after a while with whatever small amounts of food aren‚Äôt eaten in time before they float to the bottom, probably with fish poop too, and I feel like it‚Äôs not super conducive to plant growth, specifically for my Anubis (although my Java fern is FLOURISHING to say the least) But, I don‚Äôt know what else to use. I would love to plant grass for him, but I don‚Äôt know what to use or how to start. Where do I get the grass? Is it even called grass?  Are there different kinds? Do I use seeds? What substrate do I plant it in? Or would I need multiple layers of substrates? How would I clean it? Would I even need to clean it? Can I have aquarium grass in only a 5gallon tank? It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve only really seen in large extravagant tanks. 
2) If I was able to successfully get some grass going, I would really like some tiny shrimp too (if possible in a 5 gallon tank, which I‚Äôm also uncertain of). A while ago, I got 2 ghost shrimp to take care of any algae, in favor of snails (which I have since swapped to). I think they were eaten (which I felt horrible about). So, ANY suggestions in this department would be appreciated as well. Also, if I was to get shrimp, where would I get them from? The only pet store near me is petsmart, which doesn‚Äôt have a huge variety.
3) I know little to nothing about the PH/chemical process going on in the water. I am an english/history/math girl, not much of a science girl, to put it lightly. I‚Äôve tried reading forums on it, and just have a hard time understanding. My ph is good, sitting around 7 when I check, but past that I just have no idea what I should be doing or how to do it. I know enough about chemistry that I know there are probably various things happening in the tank that could chemically imbalance it. I get concerned about dead plant matter, or his poop, or if the snails poop? And things like that, because I don‚Äôt pay much attention to the actual water past a 25% water change once a month. Is that even enough? All I use when doing this is a water conditioner, letting it sit for a while before I put him back in. Any advice or explanation here would be greatly appreciated. 

Overall, I hope I do a pretty good job as is. I would like to get more into it though, and I think heavily planted bright tanks are beautiful and functional for the bettas quality of life, and I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt want to spoil mine a bit. Anything would be appreciated! I‚Äôve included a video of my betta that shows him, and a bit of his tank as well (partially because I‚Äôm proud, but partially so there can be a visual to connect to.) 
Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this and has any advice for me!!

I was in the most delicate situation of my career, between two invaders from others world, two invaders who had already won before we even knew what the empire they served truly was. For the good of my kind, I needed to find out fast.

The people of the United Republics had made their choice, and I would respect it, but they were only a fraction of all Varuls. If the need were to arrise, I could rally other countries to my cause. This ""interplanetary"" empire was strong, but we were the defenders, and technology could only do so much. Varuls were precise with their swords and deadly with their spears, and our boats were made from the strongest wood of the deepest forests. No fancy tricks the invaders had up their sleeve could defeat that.

My mind was racing about an escape plan. If I leaved the city this evening, I could reach Ferruma in little more than a week. My voice would be listened there, if I then sent a messenger...

"" Well high consul, you're suddenly very silent. You didn't even touch your plate !""

It was the ambassador who spoke, and it brought me back to reality. The banquet. I needed to use this occasion to gather information before I left. I was also wary this ""human"" was finding my behavior suspicious. I drank a bit of kalia, a traditional alcoholic drink, before asking my question :

"" Earlier, you said that your empire was different from the ones built by Varuls. Why call it that way, then ?""

It was the Archemin sitting next to me who answered.

"" Well, as I said, it a long story. Let's just say than the word ""empire"" is a remnant from a time where it was similar to what you call an empire.

- And how long ago was actually this time, count ? You say it's a long story, but it's gonna be a long feast. I would like to know what exactly we joined.""

The ambassador intervened again :

"" Why not tell him, Count ? They'll find out eventually, and besides, it's to late for them to back out now. The deal was done and we have the power to enforce it.

- You are without a doubt the worst diplomat I have ever met, and if you were not somehow also the best, I would have fired you years ago. Fine , he said, turning to me. We'll tell you everything.

Three centuries ago, the Archemin had an empire like the ones you mean. Worse, even. The noble families of Archemins were slaughtering each other for the throne, for power, for money, for land, while other species were reduced to slaves for our fields, mines and factories.""

So they used factories, like those madvaruls from Weast were building ? Interesting. That could be an advantage for us, as the quality of goods produced by our people would probably be unrivaled in the empire.

""But things changed when we found them.""

He was pointing at the ambassador.

"" We discovered the humans during a period of stability, when the throne was firmly held by House Alleon. They were one of, if not the, most advanced civilization we had discovered so far. They were on the verge of starting their own interplanetary expansion, yet we still conquered them in a couple of months. At this point, we had a method to enslave species that had not failed once. Show up, attack by surprise, bring in settlers to become the ruling class of the newly conquered world, use extreme brutality to crush any opposition. We had to break their will, destroy their culture, erase their civilization as fast a we could. Usually, it took a few years to be accepted as rulers, and even in those years, unrest was minimal. After all,  most species we enslaved by their own rulers before, so it didn't change much for them, and the medical and technological advances we provided helped to ease the pain. Besides, it's not like they had the weapons to fight us even if they wanted.

Humans were different, however. They had a lot more to lose and a lot less to gain from becoming our slaves, and if you add in their actually decent weapons, it was a recipe for brutal guerilla warfare. The humans resisted us in every possible way, hiding books and other cultural artifacts from our destruction for exemple. It did not help that their storage technology at the time allowed them to store a library's worth of knowledge in their pocket, and replicate it in a few minutes.""

I did my best to contain my surprise. It seemed I had underestimated the invader's technology.

"" They used this to keep teaching their traditions to their children, but also their science, and that was the real danger. Our science was what gave us the advantage on the other races, much more than our physical strength. With their science, humans could build bombs, firearms, repurpose stolen spacecrafts, synthesize a large array of poison, even genetically improve diseases. It was far from ours, but enough to cause trouble.

- And cause trouble we did, laughed the ambassador. Sabotages were so frequent that factories spent more time being rebuilt than working, and the productivity of mines was so low that the director of the Earth coal mining consortium couldn't heat up his own office with the production. Terran diseases were adapting suspiciously quickly to our beloved overlord's cash crops, and the only profitable Archemin ventures were the drug cartels that traded human produced drugs for weapons and tech.

- And that's only material damage. The cost in lives was even more terrifying. As soon as the humans discovered a new substance toxic for us but not for them, you could be sure to find it in your food the next day. If you survived the bombs in the place you slept at, you would still need to escape improvised snipers for the entire day, if you were lucky enough to not have to face an all out attack.

- And that was on Earth, were no man would be insane enough to use nuclear bombs ! But any other planet where you tried to use human laborers would surely get some free fireworks !

- Ah, yes,  timing was against us about that. See, the humans were at the height of the ""second cold war"" when we arrived, and their nuclear arsenal had grew to a total of around 200 000 warheads.

- Forgive my ignorance, but what is a ""nuclear bomb"" ?

- Well, said the ambassador, a small one could raze this city, while a big one could burn down a country and make it uninhabitable for a generation. I dont know the technical details however. Unfortunately, the Archemin were smart enough to only use us in a small, barely colonized region of space around Earth, so their Homeworld escaped from getting glassed""

I was getting less optimistic about our chance to beat the empire now.

"" But, what about the repression ? Didn't it dissuade them to do that ?

- Thing were getting so bad that repression couldn't even be applied properly anymore, said the count, while eating an algae-fruit. A public execution ? Humans weren't the ones that ended up shot down that day. A prison ? That's what demolition explosives are for ! In fact, we even tried to just use the barren continent at the south of Earth as a prison, because surely *that* was inescapable, right ? The governor of the Sun sector was not amused when we discovered the biggest clandestine spaceport in recorded history there three month later.

-Thankfully, his disappointment was short, as the life expectancy of that job was around six days at that time.

- Anyway, after nearly ten years of this bloody conflict, the emperor decreed it had to stop. Sure, the costs of the operation was barely making a dent in the imperial coffers and most soldiers sent to earth were death row prisoners anyway, but trouble was brewing, and he believed that he would soon need everything he had. This hemorrhage of ressources had to stop, and if violence didn't work, then he would use a truly unprecedented method...""

Its ya boy back at it again, as I attempt to break down how to describe all the DND 5e monsters in alphabetical order. For the third addition we‚Äôre looking at the ABOLETH.

# Official Canon Monster Description/Lore

Aboleth, as of 5e, are ancient, nightmare water beasties, arguably the first apex creatures to ever exist. They ruled the world at the dawn of time, enslaving all creatures around them until the gods came and sent them scurrying into the darkened corners of the world. Aboleth all have perfect ancestral memories, so they remember their fall from grace with perfect clarity and harbor massive resentment about it, constantly working patiently behind the scenes to bring the world back under their domain once more.

Physically, the aboleth actually has a pretty solid description going for it which is nice for us. 20ft long, 6500lbs on average (with ancient aboleth maybe hitting up to 40ft in length) and resembling a nightmarish eel fish. Past editions had the aboleth looking a lot more fish like, leaning into the ostracoderm (armored jawless fish from the paleozoic era) look and had three oblong eyes all stacked atop one another. 5e goes a lot more eldritch squid monster in its direction, multiple tentacles all branching from the back of the torso equivalent (called the trunk if we use squid anatomy), a lamprey style circle mouth with horrible rows of sharp looking teeth and a long tail with fin like membranes and three eyes stacked on top of each other. Easy peasy.

# When is your party going to encounter an Aboleth?

Since aboleth are the classic ‚Äúlurker in the deep‚Äù type of creature it tracks that they would only be encountered in, you guessed it, THE DEEPS. This can mean deep ocean, deep in some massive lake or lurking somewhere in a murky body of water deep in the underdark, its all up to you! Personally,  I'm of the opinion that PCs shouldn‚Äôt encounter an aboleth without first encountering a series of odd environments, strange circumstances and excessive amounts of slime, but hey once that checklist has been gone through and the mood has been set? Then baby, its aboleth time.

&#x200B;

# What things would PCs notice BEFORE actually seeing the Aboleth?

Listen, I love setting a good scene and I love to foreshadow. I feel like that stuff really makes or breaks any sort of monster encounter, but that feels especially important for a potential BBEG aboleth style monster. So lets talk about some of the descriptive signals that would suggest an aboleth is up to shenanigans in the area.

**First and foremost, slimy surroundings.**The monster manual states that anywhere within 1 mile of an aboleth lair is slimy and wet. So, if we have an aboleth in control of a seaside town or fishing village then it makes sense the ocean be downright narsty. Any and all beaches should be choked with algae, mildew and mysterious slime and any cliff faces should be nearly insurmountable due to all the wonderful aboleth gunk.

*The ocean here has a sickly black, greenish hue to it and you can see massive clumps of algae form a slimy layer just below the surface.*

*The rock face of the seaside cliffs are immediately treacherous, coated thoroughly in a slippery layer of brown and black algae collecting in slimy clumps that resemble wet hair pulled from a drain.*

*The wood of the seaside docks are caked in filth, a thick layer of muddy slime covers the rotting boards making a slip and fall into the dark algae choked water seem likely‚Ä¶*

**Second! Gross Water**The water itself around an aboleth is described as supernaturally fouled and toxic to drink. For inspiration I spent some time looking into aquatic dead zones. Aquatic dead zones are areas in bodies of water that have such a low oxygen levels that most living creatures cannot survive while a small few proliferate to an alarming degree. What if the aboleth, by sheer proximity changed the chemistry of the water? Perhaps aboleth slime infuses the water over the course of months, making it harder for oxygen to penetrate through? This would lead to a huge die off of aquatic life, as both flora and fauna struggle to get the oxygen they need to exist. Many creatures and plants die, polluting the water with their rotting bodies and fueling massive algae blooms, creating exactly the sort of slimy, foul water that the Monster Manuel describe as the terrain of an aboleth.

*A cloying smell comes from the water, so strong to be an almost physical experience. It smells like rotting fish and stagnant mud.*

*You splash into the filthy lake and feel the water cover you like a viscous coat. The visibility here is severely limited, every step along the bottom causes a puff of muck to cloud the water. Through sparse clearings in the murk you see rotting remains of aquatic creatures slowly being taken over by algae and slime.*

**Third! Odd NPC behavior**

A location under the influence of an aboleth means a portion of the populace is enslaved by the aboleth. Since there is no upper limit on the amount of slaves the aboleth can actually make, its up to you to decide what percentage of the population is aboleth controlled. No doubt in early stages of occupation,the primary goal of the aboleth thralls would be to recruit and transport new folks to the aboleth for enslaving. Sounds like the perfect set up for a cult! A strange underground group of worshipers who meet in the dead of night to manipulate or kidnap, taking victims down dark, disgusting tunnels, dragging them away to get slime slaved by the aboleth itself? Hell yeah.

Its worth noting that the aboleth thralls are still largely in control of themselves, making their own decisions and maintaining their own personalities (sort of). Enslaved by an aboleth means that a) the aboleth can talk to you at any point from any distance and b) you are charmed by the aboleth which means you can‚Äôt go about harming it AND it has advantage to socially interact with you. This implies that the aboleth enslavement works in a subtle insidious way rather than simply mind breaking the target. Instead the aboleth will worm its way into your mind, offering you all you desire if you follow it, promising that if you do just one more task you‚Äôll be free, convincing you that everything you are doing is the right call, and no doubt once you commit some atrocities, gaslighting you into thinking you are in too far now to ever back out.

Obviously having an inhuman creature with a superiority complex, gaslighting you from inside your own brain probably isn‚Äôt the greatest for mental health. So I‚Äôd expect anyone with a bad case of aboleth on the brain to be behaving erratically.Yet people are unique so a spectrum of individual response to the aboleth enslavement would make sense. Power hungry individuals and those with naturally lower empathy might throw themselves into the aboleth worship full force, reveling in their dark deeds and naturally moving up the ranks of the aboleth‚Äôs favorites. These would be the cult leaders, seemingly calm and in control, but catch them unaware and you‚Äôll see them whispering frantically to themselves as if speaking to something that isn‚Äôt there.An individual on the opposite end of the spectrum would be plagued by constant doubt and exhibit self soothing behaviors, anything from twitches, tics and fidgets, to more self destructive behaviors like drinking obsessively or not sleeping.

*As you peek through the keyhole you watch the proud, arrogant councilman undergo a shocking transformation. Bent over nearly double in a strange sort of bow, she whispers to nothing that you can see. ‚ÄúMy lord please, I only need a little more time. Soon, I swear! Yes my lord, as you say.‚Äù*

*The halfling twitches as you talk to him, his hands playing with a piece of string with a frantic manner. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt kill her, I swear I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù he mutters. As you watch he wraps the string around his finger so tightly the tip of it goes white as the circulation is cut off. He doesn‚Äôt seem to notice.*

# Main Features of the Monster

For humanoid monsters, the natural instinct is to look at the face. Since humans are wired for body language and a lot of important information is expressed via microexpressions and the like, we are hardwired to first pay attention to the face. What happens when you have a creature that is of such an alien shape that this goes out the window? I‚Äôd suggest you‚Äôd notice size first, then movement (in this case tentacles and tail) then mouth and lastly eyes. Of course all of this depends on the context in which you encounter the aboleth, so you should absolutely mix it up as you see fit!

&#x200B;

# Size, Body shape and Movement

First off, I love starting with SIZE. The average aboleth is 20ft long  which easily makes it 3-4 times bigger than your average adventurer. Describing a looming behemoth is always a fun way to ratchet up the tension.

While early additions of the aboleth had an almost triangle fish shape to them, the 5e design has a much sleeker, longer, almost eel like design to them. 5e aboleths are elongated and much more streamline, clearly designed for quick movements and sudden starts and stops. The aboleth will move through the water with ease by using its finned tail, lashing it back and forth (side to side) to propel it forward while using the tentacles to steer. In tight spaces, the tentacles would also help it to maneuver by pushing off available surfaces. On land however, the tentacles become the primary means of locomotion as the aboleth is limited to dragging its form along the ground.

*You catch a flash of movement out of the corner of your eye, something massive, eel like and sleek leaves a trail of slime behind it as a long finned tail propels it through the water.*

*An enormous elongated creature heaves itself up out of the algae slick hole amidst the chanting cultists, its form impacting onto dry land with a resounding boom you feel in your feet.*

# Tentacles

Next up, tentacles! If we‚Äôre going off of the 5e artwork, then an aboleth looks to have four tentacles, each roughly the same length, unlike squid or octopi no suction pads are to be seen. Since the aboleth lacks a grapple or restraining feature built into its tentacle attacks, it seems safe to say that the tentacles of an aboleth are more for locomotion, propelling it through the water or dragging it about on land rather than for grappling or restraining. Each one is one is thick and round, much more like a limb than the tentacles of an octopus or squid.

*The creature pushes off the rock face with four thick tentacle like limbs, the force of it cracking the dying coral and the rock underneath.*

*Two thick tentacles, each nearly two feet thick lash from the monsters side, dragging its leviathan form like a fish out of water from the pool, ever closer to the waiting cultists, a trail of slime in its wake.*

# Tail

The aboleth‚Äôs tail is much longer than its tentacles and would extend behind it, beyond the tentacles while it swims. Based on the orientation of the fins, the aboleth would move by lashing its tail side to side to propel itself forward. The tail almost seems to be another tentacle that over time evolved for swimming, so unlike a lot of fish tails it would retain its more tentacle nature, moving more like an eel or lamprey rather than a fish. About three quarters of the way down the tail we see a dorsal spike with a small fin, primarily used for balance, while the tail fin almost seems to resemble something more akin to a bats wing, thin skin stretched between spikes of the tail, rather than a traditional fish tail.

*The longest tentacle in the dead center of the creatures mass seems more akin to a tail, much thicker than the rest, it ends in series of spikes with a thin translucent skin stretched between them, similar to the wing of a bat.*

*Deep in the water of the pit, you catch sight of a lashing tail that whips back and forth slowly, keeping the creature balanced on the edge of the land and water, as the cultists walk their sacrifice closer.*

# Eyes

Aboleth traditionally have three eyes stacked vertically one on top of the other along the brow of the creature‚Äôs head. Most predators have forward oriented eyes because it provides better depth perception which is better for hunting and grabbing things. The fact that aboleth eyes are stacked on top of each other vertically rather than two eyes in a horizontal line would mean the aboleth would have a relatively narrow field of vision, but the addition of the third eye positioned towards the top of the head mean the aboleth is able to see above themselves with perfect clarity. This would imply an evolutionary lineage as bottom dwelling creatures that hunted creatures located above themselves. I‚Äôd suggest then that in a fight this would mean an aboleth prefers to be lower than its foes in the water, reaching up with its tentacles to smack em around.Another weird thing to consider is that fish don‚Äôt usually blink. Its more or less unnecessary since the constantly flowing water around them keep the eyes wet and free of debris. But aboleth are technically amphibious and if you‚Äôre going on land you‚Äôre going to need to keep your eyeballs wet. Mudskippers unlike the vast majority of fish blink (since they climb about outside the water), same with frogs and salamanders. It would make sense then that aboleth too would blink. Frogs in particular utilize something that I think makes the most sense for aboleth, a semi translucent eyelid called a nictitating membrane. This eyelid would serve to keep the aboleth‚Äôs eyes moist when on land and can even be closed while swimming to avoid all that nasty murk and sludge from drifting into the aboleth‚Äôs eye while swimming. All this is to say, hey maybe you can describe a creepy blinking to your players‚Ä¶

*Three dark eyes bulge out of the creatures face. Not vertically, but horizontally stacked, the eyes bisect the monsters face, each of them dark voids that shift slightly to take you in*

*As you gaze down into the depths at this behemoth eel creature, you watch as one eye, placed nearly on the top of the creatures head, stares directly back at you.The cultists shove the weeping woman to her knees in front of the beached aboleth. Its three dark eyes all turn to gaze down at her. The creature blinks as it takes her in, translucent lids swiping sideways across its eyes, leaving a wet sheen of slime across its pupils.*

&#x200B;

# Mouth

Aboleth design has clearly taken inspiration from the lamprey and nowhere is that more apparent than with its weird, toothy, circle mouth, but the lamprey use their weird mouth to latch onto bigger creatures and suck out the juices, a method of feeding that seems unlikely for the aboleth.

An aboleth is big enough that it makes the most sense for it to simply swallow prey whole, a theory that is further backed up by the fact that the aboleth lacks a bite attack, implying little jaw strength, if it even has the ability to munch down with that weird circle mouth at all. Instead, it makes sense for the aboleth to swallow its prey as whole as possible, while its toothy lined maw and gullet serve, rather than tearing or grinding, to dig into its prey and stop it from simply swimming out as the aboleth tries to choke it down.

Past aboleth lore mentions that they are also filter feeders, which doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense with how toothy looking our 5e aboleth is. But hey, why not a bit of both?Baleen whales filter feed by using a structure that looks like a thousands of hairs, all made of keratin. What if an aboleth had something similar between its spiky teeth to filter anything tasty down its throat. Of course, why not flavor it by saying aboleth baleen is in fact extra sharp and serves to shred larger prey as it passes down the aboleth gullet. Pretty neat.The aboleth is big enough to swim about with its mouth open most of the time, filtering algae, microorganisms, small fish and such directly into its gullet and then pumping the excess water out the gills on the side of its head, sort of whale shark style. If the aboleth doesn‚Äôt have a slave legion bringing it sacrifices then I'd assume this would primarily be how it gets its sustenance. However as soon as a collection of thralls enter the mix, since the aboleth gains the memories and knowledge of anything that it eats, it makes sense that the aboleth would reserve its big meals for something that not only assuages its physical hunger, but its hunger for knowledge as well‚Ä¶

*This creature‚Äôs circular maw is filled with pointed, yellowed teeth that seem to layer its esophagus far past the length you can see down its throat.*

*As you narrowly escape being swallowed whole you catch a glimpse of layers of sharp serrated teeth, separated by strange bonelike structures layered with needle like protrusions. This creature seems to have some sort of baleen, albeit one that looks like it would shred flesh if touched.*

# Slime

Alright good news, I‚Äôve thought way more about aboleth slime than anyone every should and I‚Äôm here to tell you all about it. Even more good news is there are plenty of slimy creatures in the ocean we can look at when we think about aboleth slime. In fact, slime is a pretty common adaptation used for a whole variety of things, though perhaps we should be calling it what it actually is‚Ä¶ mucus. Way grosser sounding somehow.

Anywho, plenty of animals coat themselves in mucus for protection, clownfish, moray eels, pacific hagfish for example. Particularly this is seen in sea creatures who don‚Äôt have scales, which means the aboleth is perfectly suited to this group.

I think its fair to assume that at least some of the aboleth‚Äôs solid armor class is due to the protective layer of mucus coating it. This is both super gross and super exciting because as a DM it means that every time my PCs try and hit an aboleth I get to describe how their weapons sink into this viscous mucus and fail to penetrate its flesh. Hooray! Fun fact, the pacific hagfish has been known to produce enough mucus under duress to choke sharks, take that wildshaped druid!

The thick slimy layer would also be what protects the aboleth when it is out of the water, retaining the moisture it needs to avoid shriveling up into a crusty little tyrant wannabe.

The other fascinating strategy that ocean creatures use their slime for is the capture and consumption of microorganisms. Vampire squid literally wave around lil mucus fishing rods and then reel em in and and eat it slime and all.  Now, we already know that aboleth partly exist as filter feeders so this strategy would also absolutely be available to them. Want to thoroughly gross out your players and really hammer home how alien your aboleth is? Maybe every now and again it moves its tentacle arm into its horrifying circle mouth and scrapes off some of the slime and gunk for a little snack! Yuck.

And of course, maybe the most important thing that the aboleth's slime does? Infects creatures that come into contact with it and makes it so they can only breath water...

*A thick layer of mucus coats the tentacle that lashes out at you, leaving a trail of slime behind in the water.*

*A massive tendril wraps, surprisingly gently around the cutlist‚Äôs sacrifice and you watch as she is coated in the same viscous slime that covers the creature. Her struggles change to gasps, her hands flying to her throat as she seems unable to breath. You watch, horrified as the aboleth releases her and cultists rush forward, grabbing her and throwing her into one of the pools. You watch as she finally manages to take a breath into her lungs below the surface of the water‚Ä¶*

*The aboleth swings a tendril through the blood that clouds the water around your wound. You watch in horror as it brings the tentacle tip back to its mouth and scrapes off a layer of slime, coated with your blood, against its teeth. That same incomprehensibly deep voice booms in your mind. ‚Äú****Delicious. I look forward to filling my maw with your entrails****‚Äù*

&#x200B;

# Making an Interesting Aboleth

Now unless your campaign is pretty buckwild, or set in earlier editions where there were entire cities of aboleth, its unlikely your party is going to encounter more than one of these, two at absolute maximum. That means we don‚Äôt necessarily have to give the aboleth as many variable attributes since its unlikely your PCs will have to tell two apart. That being said, there are certainly directions you could go with this such as‚Ä¶

**More tentacles!** More tentacles means more thangs for swanging at your angry PCs. If you want to tweak the aboleth a smidge, you could give the tentacles suction cups similar to squid or octopi and sneak a little grapple into the statblock. Don‚Äôt forget! Squid suction cups have teeth on em, so don‚Äôt forget about that slashing/piercing damage!

**More eyes**! Hey why not get rid of some of those obvious blindspots. The aboleth already has three eyes, why not more? I‚Äôve seen some sweet art where the aboleth has tons of eyes all tucked into the nooks and folds of its face. Cool as heck.

**Injuries!** Maybe your aboleth has got some battle scars duuuude. Missing a tentacle tip, having a scarred over eye or seeing a massive indent of shark teeth along the aboleth‚Äôs side all have super interesting story telling potential!

&#x200B;

Well hey, thats all I have for you! If you‚Äôve read this far then that's crazy and I appreciate you! Have you got any cool aboleth ideas? What crazy ways have you described them to your players?

# Health Canada Cannabis    Health Canada generally reviews and approves pesticides for use in cannabis cultivation based on safety and efficacy assessments. Some commonly approved pesticides for cannabis cultivation: 

# Biopesticides:   These are derived from natural materials such as plants, bacteria, or minerals. Examples include neem oil, insecticidal 	soaps, and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt).  Mineral-based Pesticides:   Certain minerals and compounds, like sulfur and copper-based 	products, may be approved for use in cannabis cultivation.  Pyrethroids:   Pyrethroids are synthetic pesticides modeled after 	pyrethrins, which are natural insecticides found in chrysanthemum 	flowers. Examples include bifenthrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin.

#   Neonicotinoids:   Neonicotinoids are a class of synthetic insecticides that 	affect the nervous system of insects. Examples include imidacloprid, 	clothianidin, and thiamethoxam.  

# Organophosphates:   Organophosphates are a class of synthetic pesticides that 	affect the nervous system of pests. Examples include malathion and 	chlorpyrifos.  

# Carbamates:   Carbamates are another class of synthetic pesticides with 	insecticidal properties. Examples include carbaryl and propoxur.

# Fungicides:   Various synthetic fungicides may be approved for controlling 	fungal diseases in cannabis cultivation. Examples include 	myclobutanil, azoxystrobin, and propiconazole.  

# Avermectins:   Avermectins are a class of synthetic pesticides with 	insecticidal and acaricidal properties. Examples include abamectin.  Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs):   IGRs are synthetic compounds that disrupt the normal development of insects. Examples include methoprene and	pyriproxyfen.  

**Miticides:**   Synthetic miticides are designed to control mites. Examples include spiromesifen and hexythiazox. 

 **Herbicides:**   Some synthetic herbicides may be approved for controlling 	weeds in cannabis cultivation. Examples include **glyphosate and 	atrazine**.  	 

**Rodenticides:**   Synthetic rodenticides may be used to control rodents in and 	around cannabis cultivation facilities. Examples include brodifacoum 	and difenacoum.  

  
**Botanical Insecticides:**   Some synthetic pesticides are formulated based on botanical 	extracts, mimicking natural insecticidal properties. Examples 	include pyrethrin-based products. 

 **Bactericides:**   Synthetic bactericides may be used to control bacterial	diseases in cannabis cultivation. Examples include copper-based 	compounds.

  **Nematicides:**   Synthetic nematicides are designed to control nematodes, 	which are microscopic worms that can harm plant roots. Examples include fenamiphos.

 **Systemic Pesticides:**   Systemic pesticides are absorbed by plants and provide 	internal protection. Examples include imidacloprid and thiamethoxam.

 **Residual Insecticides:**   Some synthetic pesticides are formulated to have a longer 	residual effect, providing extended control. Examples include 	deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin.

**Foliar Fungicides:**   Synthetic fungicides applied to plant foliage to control 	fungal diseases. Examples include boscalid and fluopyram. 

**Algaecides:**   Synthetic algaecides may be used to control algae growth in 	irrigation systems or water sources. Examples include copper-based algaecides. 

# Two recall cases in Canada cannabis:   OrganiGram (2016):     		In 2016, OrganiGram, a licensed cannabis producer in Canada, issued a voluntary recall of certain lots of dried cannabis products. The recall was initiated after the discovery of traces of the pesticide myclobutanil in the products. Myclobutanil, when heated, can 	produce hydrogen cyanide, which is a toxic substance.  		    

&#x200B;

# Mettrum (2017):  Mettrum, another licensed producer in Canada, faced a similar issue in 2017. 	Health Canada ordered a recall of Mettrum's cannabis products after 	detecting the presence of the pesticides myclobutanil and pyrethrins.

# Grow your own Cannabis and don't let these chemicals enter your lungs or bloodstream.  Ottawa just wants easy stoner tax dollars, they don't really care about your ‚Äúhealth‚Äù.  I'll be smoking my organic strains with zero chemicals added because any strong organic plant does not need these nasty chemicals --- EVER!

**‚ÄòLike the flip of a switch, it‚Äôs gone‚Äô: has the ecosystem of the UK‚Äôs largest lake collapsed?**

*Lough Neagh‚Äôs flies were seen as a nuisance. Now their sudden disappearance is a startling omen for a lake that supplies 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs water*

Declan Coney, a former eel fisher, knew there was something wrong when the famed swarms of Lough Neagh flies failed to materialise. In past years, they would appear around the Northern Irish lake in thick plumes and ‚Äúwisps‚Äù ‚Äì sometimes prompting mistaken alarm of a fire incident, Lough Shore residents say.

Clothes left out on a washing line ‚Äúwould be covered in them‚Äù, Coney says. So would any windshield on a vehicle travelling around the lough‚Äôs 90-mile shoreline. Conservationists marvelled at their courtship dances, hovering above treetops.

Last spring the flies never arrived. ‚ÄúThis is the first year ever that, if you walked up to the Cross of Ardboe or the area around there, you‚Äôd find there‚Äôs no flies,‚Äù Coney says.

The flies were long considered a nuisance. Now, however, alarm is growing. ‚ÄúPeople have really been scared,‚Äù he says, by the rate of accelerated change to the lough‚Äôs ecology that their absence signals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just happened. Like the flip of a switch, it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúLough Neagh fly‚Äù can refer to various non-biting midges, but these crucial insects support fish and wildfowl that are endemic to the lough system, as well as frogs and predatory insects. The loss of these keystone species, alongside sharp reductions of others, the spread of invasive species like zebra mussels, and a long-term deterioration in water quality, indicates deep trouble across the lough‚Äôs entire ecology. It also raises the prospect that this shallow body of water and its surrounding wetlands may have shifted beyond a state of decline into cascading ecosystem collapse.

Lough Neagh ‚Äì the largest freshwater lake in the UK ‚Äì supplies more than 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs drinking water, and hosts the largest wild eel fishery in Europe. It is considered a cultural and archaeological ‚Äújewel‚Äù that reaches ‚Äúway back‚Äù into the very beginning of shared memory on the island.

Last summer, a vast ‚Äúbloom‚Äù of blue-green algae ‚Äì a thick, photosynthesising blanket that deprives the lake of oxygen, choking aquatic life ‚Äì brought the lough‚Äôs accelerating biodiversity crisis into sharp focus. It prompted considerable public outcry and is expected to return in ‚Äúmore severe‚Äù form this coming summer.

The toxic algal growth ‚Äì described by local people as appearing like something otherworldly due to its brilliant green or blue appearance ‚Äì has since disappeared from the surface of the lough, but remains visibly suspended just underneath.

The problems have been exacerbated by the paralysis of Northern Ireland‚Äôs power-sharing institutions, which have been dormant for 40% of the period since they were formed by the Good Friday agreement, including almost all of the past two years. Members of the devolved assembly only began debating the management of the lough last week. As the politicians gathered, new reports emerged of a thick, pale scum appearing on the lough‚Äôs waterways.

From the mouth of the River Blackwater, Ciar√°n Breen rows out on to Lough Neagh. Breen has spent about three decades working on this body of water. His vessel is a cot, a small wooden boat he helped to build by the shores of Maghery, a village near Portadown on the lough‚Äôs southern end.

Breen pauses to take stock of the losses he has witnessed since he began work here as a wildlife ranger in 1986.

‚ÄúIn the winter, we did an annual wildfowl count ‚Äì a colleague and I did this particular section,‚Äù he says, gesturing towards an area of several square kilometres between Coney Island and Kells Point.

‚ÄúWe got about 50,000-60,000 diving ducks. So many that people ‚Äì our bosses, I mean ‚Äì came out of Belfast to take a look for themselves, since they didn‚Äôt believe us at first.‚Äù

These fleets of pochard, scaup and goldeneye made Lough Neagh an internationally significant site for overwintering birds in the 1980s. In the years since, their numbers have plummeted. A 2013 study found that the number of these winter migratory birds at the lough had dropped nearly 80% in a decade ‚Äì from 100,000 to fewer than 21,000.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking out there ‚Äì at the same spot ‚Äì now,‚Äù Breen says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a wee flock of coot and no ducks. None. So there‚Äôs been a catastrophic collapse in duck numbers from when I started.‚Äù

Overwintering whooper swans from Iceland used to arrive as December approached. ‚ÄúFor many years, they would herald the winter coming in,‚Äù says Tom McElhone, who lives near a disused freshwater laboratory at Tra√°d Point on the lough‚Äôs north-western shore ‚Äì its last major research facility, which closed in the early 2000s.

‚ÄúI remember lying in bed and hearing these swans calling out to each other, up and down the lough, having this magnificent conversation at all hours of the night. That‚Äôs all gone.‚Äù

Even when they move away from it, Lough Neagh courses through the veins of those like Coney, raised on its south-western shores, who have worked the water or resided within one of its many tight-knit local communities.

The 53-year-old believes, however, that many of the social ties and customs that helped fuse together these shoreline villages, parishes and townlands have unravelled during his lifetime, mirroring a progressive decline of the lough‚Äôs central fishing industry.

As the number of boats fishing the waters has dwindled ‚Äì from more than 200 in the 1980s to a few dozen today ‚Äì so too, he says, have the summer fairs and ‚Äúlough shore tug of wars‚Äù, the ad-hoc music sessions, hyperlocal vernacular ‚Äì even residents‚Äô familiarity with the water body itself.

‚ÄúThe local knowledge is not there any more,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd that sense of togetherness along the lough shore is just gone.‚Äù

Along the walls of the Toome Canal, at the north-western tip of Lough Neagh, chalk-like bright blue residue from the algal blooms was visible for weeks after the thick sludge of surface algae had disappeared from sight. Warning signs have remained in place at sites such as Ballyronan throughout the Christmas holidays and into early 2024.

The algal growths have robbed people not only of this year‚Äôs summer craic ‚Äì families around the lough, say ‚Äì but also of something calming, restorative, even ‚Äúhealing‚Äù.

And they have also prompted a belated ‚Äúawakening‚Äù to the lough‚Äôs plight, in the words of the lough shore resident and former MP for Mid-Ulster, Bernadette McAliskey (nee Devlin).

She and other veteran civil rights leaders ‚Äì who took up the cause of the area‚Äôs disfranchised fishers in the 1960s ‚Äì have been speaking up for the lough once again.

Addressing a rain-drenched demonstration by the same canal in late November, just a stone‚Äôs throw from the eel fishery‚Äôs headquarters, McAliskey cited talks to bring the lough into a community co-operative trust nearly a decade ago. It was one of a number of lost opportunities for public ownership over the past 50 years.

‚ÄúOur evidence was [that] people look after what belongs to them,‚Äù she said.

Ownership of Lough Neagh has a long and contentious history. The aristocratic Shaftesbury family has claimed the lough‚Äôs bed, banks and soil since the 19th century, having been given the asset by the Chichester family, whose territorial claim dates back to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 1600s.

The lough‚Äôs fishing communities were once bound together by a history of struggle in defending public rights to fish the lough that, in the words of House of Lords judges at a key 1911 appeal case, had been exercised ‚Äúfrom time immemorial‚Äù. But now, Coney says, many have become despondent due to mismanagement of the water body, and a ‚Äúlack of industry support‚Äù or apparent outside interest.

Those who fish for the increasingly emaciated, scattered eels only managed three weeks last season, which would usually run from May to late October.

The lough‚Äôs ecological and economic decline is now playing out amid fragmented management structures, and a lack of key scientific data ‚Äì ecological ‚Äúbaselines‚Äù.

Local communities fear that the lough may be sold on to a new private owner ‚Äì a prospect the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury has not ruled out publicly. Among many, there is a profound lack of trust or confidence in management and governing bodies.

‚ÄúThe priority has to be sustaining the life of the lough,‚Äù McAliskey told the Toome rally. ‚ÄúBecause if we sustain the life of Lough Neagh together, Lough Neagh will sustain the rest of us. So long as we work in harmony with her, there is a living [here] for everybody.

‚ÄúThis whole lough could be an income generator that keeps all of our young people from emigrating to the cities and emigrating out of the country. We could have a really good life around this lough, while supporting the rest of the ecology.‚Äù

But Breen, who has also worked in government, is less optimistic.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hoping this will blow over, now the algae‚Äôs disappeared from sight‚Äù, he says of decision-makers and government, ‚Äúand that it‚Äôll be back to business as usual.‚Äù",19 Feb 2024 10:04:47,reddit

Starch-based feedstocks encompass grains like corn and wheat and tubers such as (sweet) potatoes and cassava. These feedstocks are rich in intricate chains of sugar molecules, making them readily convertible into fermentable sugars. These sugars can then undergo conversion into ethanol or drop-in fuels. Also, the fibrous components of these plants, such as wheat straw or corn stover, hold the potential for transformation into advanced Biofuel Industry, as seen in the case of cellulosic ethanol production.

## Biofuel Industry are a never-ending, environmentally friendly fuel derived from Biomass.

Biofuels are viewed as clean and among the most readily accessible fuels globally. They are sourced from biomass like wood and straw, achieved through the direct burning of dry matter, transforming into gaseous or liquid fuel. Other origins encompass organic materials such as sludge, sewage, and vegetable oils, which can be transformed into biofuels through a wet process like digestion and fermentation.

## Types of Biofuel Industry

Biofuels are widely accessible across the globe and typically include the following fuel types:

* Biodiesel
* Bioethanol
* Bioethanol

Among these, bioethanol and biodiesel stand out as the most prevailing types of biofuels currently used, representing the first generation of biofuel technology.

### Generations and Promising Sources Of Biofuel Production from Plant Resources

The generation of biofuel from botanical resources involves using materials like timber, straw and household refuse to generate heat and power. Also, biofuels can be derived from animal fats, botanical byproducts, and various organic waste materials from living organisms.

### This progression is categorised into three distinct types:

* First-generation: Biofuels primarily originate from consumable sources like sugar, [**starch**](https://bluecraftagro.com/product/food-grade-starch/), and other food crops cultivated on arable land.
* Second generation: Biofuels are produced using non-edible plant substances, including dry plant matter, woody biomass, [**agricultural**](https://bluecraftagro.com/)  remains and detritus.
* Third generation: Biofuels predominantly stem from algae and microorganisms, known for their high yield potential.

Also, the jatropha, belonging to the spurge family and containing a genus of flowering plants, is a notable [**biofuel industry**](https://bluecraftagro.com/product-category/oil-gas/)¬† across various global regions.

### The Biofuel Production Process

**Phase 1:**

Carefully selected plant crops are allowed to bask openly under the sun‚Äôs warmth.

**Phase 2:**

Subsequently, these cultivated crops undergo thorough refining procedures within factory settings to yield various food products.

**Phase 3:**

Following the creation of [**food products**](https://bluecraftagro.com/blog/exploring-the-role-of-starches-in-the-food-industry/), these crops are again subjected to refinement geared towards biofuel production.

**Phase 4:**

Upon the successful generation of biofuels, they are meticulously gathered into storage tanks and readied for subsequent processes.

#### The biomass or raw materials used for crafting biofuels include:

* Grain starch for bioethanol production: Comprising crops such as[ **corn and wheat.**](https://bluecraftagro.com/)
* Sugar crops for bioethanol production: Including sugarcane and sugar beets.
* Oilseed crops for biodiesel production: Encompassing soybeans, rapeseeds, palm oil, cooking oil, and various tropical oilseeds.

#### Also, cellulosic biomass serves as a crucial resource for bioethanol production and includes:

* Residues from forests.
* Municipal solid waste.
* Managed biomass, which incorporates trees and grass.
* Crop remnants include corn stover, wheat straw, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse.

#### Advantages of Biofuel

* Promotes public health by reducing toxic emissions.
* Contributes to a cleaner environment.
* Eliminates hazardous gases like Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Sulphur Oxide (SO) emissions.
* Reduces the risk of cancer and respiratory issues in humans due to non-toxic emissions.
* Mitigates the threat of global warming, making it eco-friendly.

#### Disadvantages of Biofuel

* Disruption of natural life cycles.
* High labour costs and significant storage space requirements.
* Increased water consumption, particularly in arid regions.
* Elevated demand for agricultural land when cultivating biomass for biofuel production.

##### The Rationale for Biofuel Adoption

Biofuels present various advantages and drawbacks concerning their impact on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Globally, the foremost biofuel drivers revolve around reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, bolstering energy security by decreasing crude oil imports and fostering rural development. These same advantages align with the findings of the Niti Aayog report, encompassing enhanced energy security through potential crude oil import reductions, increased engagement of local entrepreneurs and sugarcane farmers in the energy sector and reduced vehicular emissions. While the advantages for farmers are unmistakable, as any surge in demand for crops, not limited to biofuel crops, benefits them, the energy and environmental gains are nuanced and heavily contingent on specific contexts.

##### Net Energy Balance

The overall energy ratio (OER), which signifies the ratio of energy delivered by a fuel (be it petroleum or biofuel) to the total energy inputs required for its production, exhibits its highest value for gasoline and its lowest for cellulosic ethanol. However, using renewable energy sources to produce biofuels results in a lower fossil energy ratio (FER), representing the ratio of liquid energy output to fossil energy input. Gasoline maintains an FER equivalent to its OER at approximately 0.8, while Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol boasts an FER of about 10. The notably high FER for sugarcane-based ethanol can be attributed to the substantial contribution of energy from sugarcane fibre in its production process. Although specific FER estimates for Indian ethanol are unavailable, they are likely to be lower than those for Brazilian ethanol, as the latter is consistently rated as the most energy-efficient biofuel in numerous studies.",12 Feb 2024 07:03:04,reddit
192,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeculativeEvolution/comments/1aor825/a_terrestrial_wetland_equivalent_to_coral_reefs/,A terrestrial (wetland) equivalent to coral reefs,"Coral reefs are incredibly beautiful and diverse environments, but they're limited to marine environments due to the biology and limitations of the corals themselves.

Corals feed on zooplankton that is abundant in their circulating waters, but circulating air is comparatively poor in floating organisms. Any hard corals would also run into the issue of acquiring enough minerals to build their skeleton. Along with that, there's also the issue of reproduction, with corals relying on water currents to reproduce, which prevents them from moving upstream and into terrestrial areas. This all makes it very unlikely for any corals to evolve to live on the land, but other groups could create similar habitats, with one such group being fungi.

Swamps and other wetlands have lots of dead organic matter to decompose, but their soils and waters are too oxygen-poor for fungi to break it down. This could be solved if fungi were to evolve to be colonial and create large spires like [prototaxites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototaxites). These towers could function as respiratory organs, pulling in oxygen-rich air from above the water and bringing it down to the rest of the fungus. These towers could also assist in reproduction by allowing for easier spore dispersal.

Some of these fungi could become symbiotic with various algae or other plants to provide additional energy and oxygen while the plants receive abundant nutrients. These fungal towers and their various symbiotes could produce a wide array of pigments, either to show their toxicity in the case of the fungi or to perform photosynthesis in the case of the algae.

This would produce a dynamic ecosystem similar to coral reefs that could thrive in wetland environments, making these already diverse areas even richer in biodiversity and life.

It seems to make the herd hallucinate.

When Clark seizes, he's got a dusting of snow on his coat, so he was just outside at the same time.

Asked ChatGPT: ""150 miles north of the arctic circle, what kind of substance in a cloud could explain hallucinations/panicking of a herd of caribou?""

Response:

> The phenomenon of hallucinations or panic in a herd of caribou 150 miles north of the Arctic Circle, attributed to a substance in clouds, could be theoretically explained by a few speculative and environmental factors, although it's important to note that such a scenario is highly unusual and would require specific and rare conditions. Here are some possibilities:

> Toxic Algal Blooms: While typically associated with aquatic environments, the toxins produced by algal blooms (such as neurotoxins from harmful algae) can become aerosolized under certain conditions. If these toxins were to be carried into cloud formations and subsequently deposited in an area with caribou through precipitation, it could potentially affect their neurological systems. However, the feasibility of this scenario occurring in the Arctic, and specifically through clouds, is highly speculative and unprecedented in scientific literature.

> Volcanic Gases: Volcanic eruptions can release a variety of gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), into the atmosphere. These gases can travel long distances and, under specific atmospheric conditions, could potentially be associated with cloud formations. High concentrations of these gases can have toxic effects on wildlife, including disorientation or panic. However, the presence and effect of such gases in the Arctic region, transported by clouds, would be a rare event.

> Anthropogenic Chemicals: Industrial pollutants and chemicals can travel long distances in the atmosphere. Certain chemicals, if present in high concentrations, could potentially cause disorientation or neurological effects in wildlife. This would require a significant and concentrated release of chemicals that somehow become encapsulated within cloud formations and then precipitated out, which is a highly speculative scenario.

> Mycotoxins from Fungi: Certain types of fungi produce mycotoxins that can be harmful to animals and humans. In theory, spores from these fungi could become airborne and, under the right conditions, could be involved in cloud formation or precipitation, leading to exposure in wildlife. This scenario, however, is highly speculative and there's no direct evidence to suggest it occurs in nature in the manner described.

> Natural Gas Emissions: Methane and other natural gases can seep from the ground in areas rich in organic deposits or where there is geothermal activity. If such gases were somehow to become concentrated in cloud formations and affect animal behavior, it would represent a novel and undocumented phenomenon.

> It's crucial to emphasize that these scenarios are speculative and not based on documented scientific phenomena. The direct link between specific substances in clouds causing hallucinations or panic in caribou herds would require a novel mechanism of environmental interaction that has yet to be observed or studied in detail. Realistically, environmental stressors that lead to panic or unusual behavior in wildlife are often more terrestrial or direct in nature, such as predation pressure, human activity, or direct exposure to toxins in their environment.

I find both toxic algal blooms and mycotoxins from fungi particularly fascinating here, as Clark was specifically researching cyanobacteria and Alternaria (black mold).

Asking a followup: ""Could the absence of sunlight contribute to any of these factors?""

> Changes in Microbial Activity: The absence of sunlight can alter the temperature and moisture conditions in the environment, which can affect microbial and fungal activity. In theory, increased fungal activity could lead to higher concentrations of spores or mycotoxins in the environment. While this could affect animal health if ingested or inhaled directly, the connection to cloud-borne substances is speculative.

The timing of the black water appearing in the Villages is the same as the last sunset, is the same as the caribou herd freakout, is the same as Clark's seizure, etc. They all have the absence of light in common.

In another post I shared a research paper studying the impact of blue light and its absence on black mold. Blue light increases mycotoxin production by 2-3x, and it's absence causes spore proliferation.

Abnormal amounts of blue-green light also turns cyanobacteria... orange. In the opening credits, twice we see a setup of blue-green lights surrounding one orange rod. What were they doing there?",08 Feb 2024 15:00:09,reddit

But, to help me out and to perhaps even nix it completely (lol, I know, let me dream) I am looking into mystery snails as an add-on to my clean up crew. Previously I had brought on board a SAE but he didn't end up lasting long- my suspicion is he got too stressed by his tankmates. We then brought in a nerite (onion snail variety), and the barbs straight-up stressed it to death in 2 days.

The tank is the 45-ish gallon bowfront that Fluval makes (actual volume something like 46.7 gallons?), with a Fluval 406 for a filter. Lots of java ferns, some anubias, some hygrophila that refuses to stay in my substrate so I just let it float, and a whole schwack of hornwort. Livestock are a Bristlenose Pleco, a pair of Otos (hoping to get them some friends soon), 8 zebra danios and 13 Glo Tiger Barbs. We don't have a huge amount of hardscape hidey-holes, but we've got two caves plus a big cavernish centerpiece and all the roots you could ask for plus some wood for the BN to rasp at.

The question is- I keep seeing mixed things on the supposed toxicity of Mystery Snails. I hadn't come across any mention of it in my initial poking around, and it was only at my LFS that a staffer mentioned they don't carry them anymore because of some neurotoxin that's in them and their eggs. My plan had been to get one and if it happened to be female to then break up the egg sacs as a bit of a live food treat for the danios and tigers. Another LFS I went to had never heard of anything like this, and now that I'm looking for info on it online I keep getting the range between ""hell, you can eat 'em"" to ""wear gloves when taking the egg sacs out"". Our tiger barbs are a pretty rowdy shoal, apparently, so the likelihood they would give a mystery snail a few test nips while everyone's figuring each other out is pretty high, and they're not especially clever so I imagine the occasional nip may always be in the cards. Would I be endangering the barbs with a mystery snail in the tank? Conversely, can mystery snails handle the occasional abuse like that or should I look for something else that has a taste for black algae? It's a short list!

Any help or guidance anybody has would be greatly appreciated!",06 Feb 2024 13:57:09,reddit

Hey, all. So, I‚Äôve got an approx 1 year old tank, started it with a mix of various frags after the bacteria-in-a-bottle start. It‚Äôs a little IM AIO Lagoon, 25 gallons. It reached the point where the coral was surviving but not ‚Äòthriving‚Äô‚Äîalso had a spontaneous colony of pods that was fat and health, they eventually died off. 

Turns out, there were NO nutrients in the tank (I did give the occasional reef roids feeding).  So, finally added a fish (purple firefish). I feed it the frozen brine shrimp (I just shave a little from the cube, but what he‚Äôll eat), but I notice everywhere I dump it in, there is cyano all over that specific spot next day.

I am dealing with hair algae and black beard algae in this aquarium at moderate levels due to my immense amount of hornwort and my deep sand bed that is 3.5in in depth. The color of the algae is a mix of blue, green, and grey. The algae is also hard (in a way similar to encrusting saltwater algae) and crunches if I attempt to squeeze the algae in my fist. The individual strands of the algae are also larger compared to regular green hair algae and can be picked out individually. There has also been a noticeable change in the smell of the aquarium, it does not exactly smell bad or like septic, more like just unusual and neutral. I have not had blue-green slime/cyanobacteria algae before and this does not sound like it due to the hardness of the algae as well as the thickness of the strands. I was not sure if this was some rare form of freshwater calcareous algae since it is hard and thick as well as that my water is quite hard with a high pH. Does anyone have any idea of what this algae might be?

I have attached pictures of the algae, note that it is a bit dehydrated.

Context: My world, The Vau, is the central location of my series I'm working on, Time of the Paragons. It's set in an binary star system (kind of), and focuses on events on four planetoids that orbit a brown dwarf (Kvum) that is in a binary orbit with a red dwarf (Bora). From one of the planetoids, Shuerash, comes the vapelese people.

Vapel are bipedal humanoids, tetrapodal in limb plan, plantigrade in stance, with five digits on their hands and feet.

* Avg. Height: 1.1m
* Avg. Weight: 21kg
* Natural Habitat: Savannahs and the fringes of deserts.
* Diet: primarily vegetarian but not exclusively.
* Intelligence: Sapient
* Unique traits:
   * Outside their small size, their skin is soft blue. This is due to a symbiotic relationship they have with cyanobacteria which lives in their skin. This also makes their skin poisonous.
   * They also have frond-like antennae which are connected to their senses of smell and hearing. The antennae are sensitive enough to detect the faintest scent molecules or sound vibrations, but not precise enough to locate it. Instead they act as early warning, notifying the vapel that a possible threat may be nearby so they can locate it with their sharp noses and sensitive ears.
   * Their eyes are wide-set and large. This gives them excellent peripheral vision as well as more space for a larger nasal chamber. Their noses also have soft wet tips like a dog or cat. Living on the savannah they have also evolved horizontally slit pupils. This gives them good focus on a flat plane, better able to spot predators.
* History: There are two major vapelese cultures, the Wonsullish and the Hatr√¥pians.
   * The Wonsullish are traditionally semi-nomadic. They would set up their settlements far in the desert, usually around an oasis. The fittest members would then travel to more fertile lands, harvesting food to bring back. This isolated their homes from the many dangers that lived on the savannahs. Wonsullish can be spotted as they've begun to lose their symbiotic nature with the cyanobacterias and thus have much paler skin than their cousins the qofallish.
   * The Hatr√¥pians are more sedentary. Rather than live in deserts and wander, they live largely along the northwestern coast, preferring wetlands and thick forests, where they live on platform villages in the trees. They have a much stronger relationship with the cyanobacteria and so are much bluer than the Wonsullish.
   * Vapels of both cultuers were long victims of enslavement by the peviuir after they returned to Shuerash. Their small size and hardy nature combined with not needing to eat as much as other peoples of The Vau made them the ""perfect"" candidates for being put to work in fields and factories, particularly on the neighbouring planetoid of Shudo.",07 May 2024 03:08:32,reddit

while I think it killed the cyanobacteria, the resulting nitrates spike has been concerning. I lost several of my older fish (rip mikey and gerard my 5.5 year old cory cats I miss them so much üò¢üíú) and 4 black neon tetras. My theory is I don‚Äôt think they could handle the sudden nitrates change from the algae death. 

the remaining residents of the tank are some shrimp, one nerite snail, and two betta females (the result of a failed beta sorority‚ÄîI am never be attempting one again. these two are indifferent to each other but like to hide. I am looking into getting another tank or rehoming one of them)

I‚Äôve attached a pic of my levels. Have done about 3 30-40% water changes over the past three weeks since the fritz. One since the big die off (got sick). Aggressively scrubbing down green algae on the glass each time. Cutting and removing leaves that get overwhelmed with algae. Added frog bit. The nitrates have reduced from 160 to 80, which is encouraging, but slow and too little change for my liking. 

1. Is there any way to speed up lowering my nitrates? 
2. Is the ph of my water concerning or possibly contributing to any of the issues i‚Äôm having? It has gotten more basic in the past 6 months since I moved house, and I think the hardwood features I added a month ago might have also upped it. If it is a problem, how to lower it safely?

Initially, I was more interested in stopping plastics from entering our waterways by designing an 'end of pipe' solution. However, after conducting extensive research, I have now realised that plastics are only the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is that when it rains, vegetation ends up in our stormwater systems and begins to rot away. This rotting vegetation provides huge nutrient loads for cyanobacteria to thrive on and our drainage systems make for the perfect conditions for such bacteria. All around Australia we are starting to see these harmful bacterial blooms spreading into our local waterways. It begs the questions, why are we still not doing anything about this?

It is more of my coming to accept our fate, so to say.



Let me start out by saying that since I was a small child I have always cared deeply about nature and the environment. Almost like I understood that it is important, it keeps us healthy, it keeps us alive. I was fortunate enough to grow up right next to a forest park filled with wildlife. I would climb trees with my friends, pick the wild berries and catch frogs in the ponds. And in my later years I still love to feed the birds and small mammals in this same exact area.

  
In 2019 when I was 24, I moved to Australia for work. While I was there I decided to take the chance to visit the Great Barrier Reef. I originally hadn't intended on it but it is one of the great wonders of the world after all, why not take the chance.

Well, from the very moment I signed up for it I knew that something was deeply wrong. The guide recommended me a specific tour that would go to a place where quote on quote 'there are still fish'. My heart was broken upon witnessing it in person. Yes, there were still some fish but it was nothing like I had seen it in the nature documentaries from my childhood. It was dull, grey, clinging onto life. Much of the surrounding reefs were completely dead. 

That was the moment in my life where everything hit me.  

We did this.

I was so naive as a child, in my little bubble of the world.   
Growing up and realising that just by \*existing\* in this global North, capitalist hell system I am contributing to the destruction of ecosystems around the world hit me like a tonne of bricks and I fell into a deep depression. 

If I bought something, anything, really; let's give chocolate for example. By buying that bar of chocolate, dozens, hundreds of trees and vegetation had to be destroyed, all of the wildlife that depended on them, slaughtered or left homeless, starving with nothing to eat, maybe they'd try to take some of our crops and we would kill them for trying to feed themselves. Some poor third world farmer basically being treated as a modern slave has to harvest the beans for my 'chocolate' in shit conditions for shit pay by a massive company who is the only one that profits in all this.

So many people, especially in urban areas are not aware of any of this and how could you blame them? It is hidden so well. You're not thinking about any of that when you buy something in the store, you've not thinking about where it came from or the damage it caused, just that it is there on the shelf and you can buy it. We are so detached from the natural world that there is no appreciation for how much blood was spilled for us to be able to live a comfortable life.

I couldn't watch nature documentaries anymore. I would cry and every time toward the end they would show what humanity's destruction is doing to kill off every last living thing that is not us or our livestock but there would be some hopium thrown in like 'BUT it's not too late! You can switch to an electric car' or some bullshit--

It did nothing to relieve me of the deep sense of dread I felt for years and still do to some degree. I think I've gone through every stage of grief. denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.

But how do you accept this when it hurts you so deeply? How do you accept that we are destroying not only ourselves but everything around us and there's nothing we can do about it?

I started listening to Dr William Rees talk about overshoot and his understanding of life, death and everything  in between. 

I specifically want to quote what he says here

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE39xfNRRyw&t=36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE39xfNRRyw&t=36:52)

(That entire podcast is a very good watch for anyone suffering the same unsettling thoughts as me btw.)

He mentions how unsustainability is the default. It has really helped me to cope with all of this. I love how he explains that humans are still a part of nature and cannot extract themselves away from it no matter how hard we try, we are all still bound by the same laws of the natural world. How living things are all just varying degrees of energy gradients. It is a natural phenomenon built into the DNA of every living thing on the planet to want to consume as much energy as they can and expand their population as wide and far as they can. Usually there are negative feedbacks such as disease, war, famine that prevent such exponential growth but they were temporarily halted due to the use of fossil energy. So what you get is overshoot on a global scale. What happens when we no longer have cheap and easy to extract fossil fuels? The same thing as all other species that exceeded their carrying capacity.

The thing is, humanity is supposedly self-aware that it is doing this, yet denies it's animal nature.

Wouldn't an intelligent species look at what we are doing and think, hey, maybe we should cut back, stop depleting all of the non-renewable resources at an outrageous pace and leave some for the future generations? Leave some room for all the other species on Earth?

I guess the more frustrating part about this is that we call ourselves an intelligent species far above everything else yet we are doing the exact same thing as what a fucking yeast in a petri dish would do. We are no different from the cyanobacteria that caused a mass extinction. 

Only we are self aware.

And sadly this will correct itself if we don't do so ourselves. And we won't because who wants to reduce their energy consumption? The majority don't want to give up what they have. People are rioting right now because of the planned '15 minute cities'. It's not going to change until nature corrects us itself.

When there is a boom among *any* species there has to be a bust.

But I have accepted the fate of the natural world, our fate and accepting that we are not removed from nature, we are animals behaving in an animal way. 

Maybe I had hope that we were something more at some point and that's why I couldn't accept this for a long time.

tl;dr: Humans are a living species and act like any other species would in favorable conditions. Because of this, there is really no solution to the many environmental problems we've caused. We will just have to let it play out in nature.

I realise this may be an unpopular opinion and it's not to say that you shouldn't still care for your surroundings and the environment but it has helped me to understand the whole mess, I suppose.",27 Apr 2024 18:08:59,reddit

The blue supergiant Delta Leonis (also called Zosma) is one of the brightest objects in Akila's night sky, even at fifty light years distance. Orbiting its fifth planet is a moon much like our Montera Luna, small and distant from its host star, but warmed by the radiant and reflected energy from the gas giant it orbits. Unlike Montera however, Zosma V is a ringed giant and unlike Luna, Zosma V-a orbits so closely that the planet does not so much hang in the sky as loom, its rings stretching across a full quarter of the horizon. in all our travels we have seen nothing to rival it. 

Like most satellites of gas giants, V-a is tidally locked, completing an orbit and thus one full rotation every 12 standard hours.

The blue supergiant Delta Leonis (also called Zosma) is one of the brightest objects in Akila's night sky, even at fifty light years distance. Orbiting its fifth planet is a moon much like our Montera Luna, small and distant from its host star, but warmed by the radiant and reflected energy from the gas giant it orbits. Unlike Montera however, Zosma V is a ringed giant and unlike Luna, Zosma V-a orbits so closely that the planet does not so much hang in the sky as loom, its rings stretching across a full quarter of the horizon. in all our travels we have seen nothing to rival it. 

Like most satellites of gas giants, V-a is tidally locked, completing an orbit and thus one full rotation every 12 standard hours.

Best guess is this is cyanobacteria because I had some growing on my filter before I realized it had been turned off for like 2 weeks (didn't know the cleaning people unplugged it...).

Is it ""dangerous"" or can I just leave it be? The shrimp seem to enjoy the weird moss ball so if it's not super invasive or harmful I'd like to keep it in there for them.

It is my first one and it's been a very pleasant experience despise all the problems I'm having from time to time. 

First of all, it's already stable (8 litres weekly changes, 0 am√¥nia, 0 nitrites, 10 nitrates, pH around 0.02 , rest of if is under regular levels, it goes low from time to time , then I change the water and goes up again). 

And before telling my story, please give me some advice about what corals do I introduce and where to put those. I'm rookie and I know is not the best good looking one but I like to learn.

I went to a business travel, an euphyllia died and my wife realized 2 days after. All the acroporas died and other soft corals too. In consequence I had a huge plague of cyanobacteria that I needed help to control (3 days no light no skimmer no reactor and antibiotics) and now I have some algae because overfeeding after a big murderous treachery.

So, I had two fire shrimp. Murdered viciously with no witness. Then one day I find the shrimp eating the goby like a sandwich. Other day I found the second one in the same hands... And I started to think what is going on. Parameters were perfect all the time by the way.

So, since I didn't have no more fishes, I had to buy another three.  Two black and white clowns and a Benito. 

The first clown appeared in the wave maker . Then the Gobi one morning in the hands of the shrimp as a nutritive breakfast. 

And this morning again, the last clown was as a hat of one of my sea urchin. 


Seriously wtf? Parameters perfect again. No snail, no shrimp, no sea star no sea urchin looks bad. Hell, even the corals are growing like hell now! 

I've read about the chance of having a mantis in the tank, but I never heard or saw a thing. 

And then there is the only one that suspiciously survives, this shrimp. Its already the size of my hand. It attacks anything that approaches. You can see it walking around during the night stealing food from the polyps and algae.  And I saw it attacking shrimps some times. 

What do you think? Is this massive shrimp? It's well fed... It has pellets, mysis sometimes and algae. Never bothers a sea urchins , sea stars or snails. I don't know what to think. Shall I get rid of it and put 3 more fishes again? Shall I wait to see if anything else dies? Or just accept that I have a shrimp dominion tank?

##Armenia and Azerbaijan reach a preliminary agreement to delimit parts of the Tavush border

[Joint statement here.](https://en.armradio.am/2024/04/19/armenia-azerbaijan-agree-that-the-process-of-delimitation-will-be-based-on-1991-alma-ata-declaration/)

The map published by the press indicates that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached a preliminary agreement to delimit the border stretching between Baghanis and Voskepar and that Azerbaijani forces will not cross into the Armenian highway in this section. 

Going further south, between Voskepar and Kirants, this second most talked-about area will be excluded from this delimitation phase and the Armenian forces will maintain control over the hilly curvy road. This is the area where the Armenian road crosses the border multiple times. After PM Pashinyan's recent meeting with local residents, one resident claimed that Pashinyan told them that they are negotiating with Azerbaijan to keep Azeri forces behind the river, which is in line with the map presented today. 

Going further south, the Azeri village Kheyremlu will protrude and cover part of the Armenian road passing near the Armenian village of Kirants. During the recent meeting with residents, Pashinyan informed residents that building a bypass road won't be a problem here. 

Going further down, the border will be delimited near Berkaber. The Azeri village on the other side of the border has already been under Azeri control for decades. 

**REPORTER:** The AM-AZ border commissions have released a joint statement about a preliminary agreement. What can you tell us about this?

**GOVERNMENT:** The commissions reproduced on the map the borders that existed during the period of the Soviet Union in this section, and in the next step, these borders should be clarified and expressed on the ground as well, and this will be an unprecedented event. For the first time, there will be a demarcated state border between our countries, in the section of the four villages.

**REPORTER:** What year of maps is this process based on?

**GOVERNMENT:** The most recent topographical maps with a legal base of the USSR period. The important detail is that according to the statement issued by the border Commissions, the borders that existed at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union have a legal basis and are being restored. It is also important to record that the Commissions agreed that in the entire process of border delimitation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, they will rely on the 1991 Alma Ata Declaration. This principle should also be recorded in the Regulation of the border delimitation process, which will be agreed upon between the parties in the coming months and will undergo the necessary internal processes, including the approval process in the parliament.

**REPORTER:** The issue of enclaves/exclaves is also mentioned in the joint statement of the Border Delimitation Commissions, what does that mean?
 
**GOVERNMENT:** The Commissions agreed that after the approval of the Regulation, they will agree on the order of delimitation of the remaining sections of the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border, and in this context, they will also address the issue of enclaves/exclaves. Armenia cannot renounce this issue, because Artsvashen is a part of the sovereign territory of our country. We are going to de jure substantiate the existence of the Artsvashen exclave/enclave in the delimitation process, and the government of the Republic of Armenia has such substantiations, after which the actual delimitation process around Artsvashen will be carried out. What kind of political solution will be given to the issue after being recorded is a different question. In the delimitation process, the existence of the exclave/enclaves must first be substantiated de jure.

**REPORTER:** After the border delimitation, the armed forces will withdraw in the area of the four villages and give way to the border guard troops. When will this happen?

**GOVERNMENT:** It should happen soon, without artificial delays.

**REPORTER:** As a result of this process, will any village in Armenia be deprived of roads?

**GOVERNMENT:** No. In the section of Kirants village, a few hundred meters section of the road outline will be changed, which is not something difficult and will be implemented in a few months. But this is not the only road for Kirants. The Kirants-Acharkut-Ijevan road will be repaired, maybe rebuilt as well. Kirants also has an alternative road, and practically there are no major problems.

**REPORTER:** And Voskepar won‚Äôt have road problems?

**GOVERNMENT:** No. At this stage, areas that have the potential to cause such a problem are not being delimited.

**REPORTER:** As a result of this border delimitation process, Azerbaijan will come close to the villages of Kirants and Voskepar in a number of areas. How will the security of these villages be ensured?

**GOVERNMENT:** Azerbaijan is already very close to those villages and they are under direct fire. Yes, as a result of this process, the border guard service of Azerbaijan will get closer, but their villages and ours will be separated by a delimited state border. This is a key factor and let's not forget that the border protection will be carried out by the border guards of the Republic of Armenia. In addition, there are many details of providing security, which will also be discussed and detailed in the near future.

##prominent members of the ruling party respond to the border delimitation agreement 

The opposition's stance on Tavush delimitation has been clear: it's capitulation and treason. Ranking members of the ruling party responded to the new agreement: 

**MP KHANDANYAN:** The border commissions have agreed to rely on the 1991 Almaty Declaration, which is recorded as a fundamental principle of the demarcation process. It should continue to be the main political condition in the further process of state border delimitation.

**MP KONJOYAN:** This is the first time we're going to have a demarcated section of the AM-AZ border. The clear recording of the border will become a decisive and legitimate factor aimed at protecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Armenia.

**MP ALEXANYAN:** Having a delimited and demarcated state border with Azerbaijan based on the Alma Ata Declaration can become the basis of long-term peace and stability for the region, and Armenia will continue to steadily move in this direction. Expect the known forces to receive a metodichka [from Russia] to launch a new whining campaign. 

**MP GRIGORYAN:** Azerbaijan was previously refusing to accept the 1991 declaration as the basis for this process. They were also previously refusing to rely on the de jure situation at the time of the collapse of the USSR, in other words, the most recent de jure topographical maps of USSR.

##interview with Pashinyan's chief of staff about the border delimitation 

**REPORTER:** What does this agreement mean?

**HARUTYUNAN:** This is an outcome of very hard work. If we are able to implement the agreement, we will have an unprecedented situation in AM-AZ relations. It creates a civilized platform where specific documents and agreements can allow us to clarify and reaffirm the AM-AZ state border. Negotiations are always better than aggression. Since there was a tension created by the media around these 4 villages, we decided to make an offer and choose this path, and the parties agreed. We have long insisted that the delimitation must be based on de jure documents so you can use the same thing to demarcate the entire AM-AZ border from north to south with the same logic. The basis of our agreement are the latest legal topographic maps that hold de jure power, that were created by Soviet authorities with relevant power. We have worked very long to use Almaty as the basis. We raised this during various formats and meetings. I'm very happy that it is fixed as the main principle. 

**REPORTER:** What about enclaves/exclaves?

**HARUTYUNAN:** As we've said before, Artsvashen is legally part of Armenia. We have documents proving that. Armenian government acknowledges that the Constitution and law require us not to ignore any territory belonging to Armenia, so the exclave topic is on the table. Similarly, if Azerbaijan claims it has exclaves controlled by Armenia then they must prove it by presenting de jure documents. 

**REPORTER:** The armed forces will retreat to give way to border guards. When?

**HARUTYUNAN:** Within a reasonable timeframe after the commissions and departments reach an agreement. We will first discuss various security issues concerning neighboring areas.  

**REPORTER:** Will the Armenian villages lose roads? 

**HARUTYUNAN:** There is a small section in the Kirants direction, a few hundred meters, which has an easy terrain and our experts can resolve that issue within several months. Additionally, we will repair or rebuild the existing secondary road in that section - the Kirants-Acharkut-Ijevan.
 
**REPORTER:** Will there be a problem in Voskepar road?

**HARUTYUNAN:** No. All the concerns that the residents of Voskepar raised during the meeting with Pashinyan have been heard, and that road is not part of the delimitation process at this phase. 

**REPORTER:** How will you organize the protection of nearby villages if the border gets closer?

**HARUTYUNAN:** The line of contact is already very close to their homes. These villages have been in the line of fire. The conversion of the line of contact into a state border will make it safer. Because of modern technologies, living hundreds of kilometers away without a stable border is more dangerous than living near a stable border. This topic is often manipulated by those who oppose the delimitation process.  

**REPORTER:** What does Armenia gain from this process?

**HARUTYUNAN:** Armenia gains (1) a stable border, (2) confirmation of the Almaty Declaration as the main principle, (3) a civilized platform for discussing and reaffirming the borders, (4) the basis for using jure documents that will allow us to demarcate the AM-AZ border from top to bottom, (5) Armenia stands on its legitimate territory by returning the 2.5 villages to Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** The Friday agreement says parties agree to later continue to demarcate the rest of the border. So is this the beginning of a lengthy process? 

**HARUTYUNAN:** This is going to be a long and complex process. Armenia is committed to the peace agenda.

##Armenia offered its services as a potential facilitator between Israel and Palestine 

FM Mirzoyan visited Saudi Arabia earlier this week. ArabNews outlet interviewed him. 

**ARAB NEWS:** Mirzoyan expressed his support for a two-state solution and ceasefire in Palestine. In December last year, Armenia joined Saudi Arabia and more than 150 other countries in the UN General Assembly in voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. If necessary, and if asked, Mirzoyan said Armenia would be ready to act as a potential facilitator between the two sides.

**MIRZOYAN:** Armenia has always supported the two-state solution, and Armenia is strongly against the violence and targeting civilian populations. Armenia had very recently been on the receiving end of such violence. So we are strongly against violence against civilian populations.

**ARAB NEWS:** Armenia‚Äôs commitment to helping war-affected civilian populations has gone beyond mere words and condemnation. Last month it sent 30 tonnes of food and medicine to displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in Rafah. Armenia regretted seeing tens of thousands of innocent victims of the escalation of hostilities in Gaza, said Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at a press briefing during a visit to Egypt to discuss aid deliveries. Armenia is embarking on diplomatic ties with several nations and multilateral bodies, including the EU, as it shifts away from its historically strongest ally, Russia.

**FM MIRZOYAN:** The people of Armenia have European aspirations and it is becoming more and more strong on the background of the frustration that Armenian people had in terms of Armenian-Russian relations, but not limited to that. Armenia is really deepening, significantly deepening, its relations with the US, with the EU. They are our main partners in our democratic reform agenda. Now they show a strong willingness to support Armenia, to strengthen Armenia‚Äôs economic resilience. We are starting with the EU a new path of close partnership and, so far, none can say for sure where this path will lead the two sides.

Context in [April 18 news](https://www.reddit.com/r/armenia/comments/1c7h9fc/war_crime_case_filed_against_ilham_aliyev_regime/).

##Kremlin confirms the recent ""leak"" by a ranking CSTO official: CSTO and Russia do not recognize Armenia's territories and therefore cannot protect it 

Armenia requested military-political assistance from CSTO and Russia after the Azerbaijani army encroached several kilometers into Armenian territories and stood near the outskirts of the town of Jermuk in 2022. They encroached far beyond the immediate line of contact, beyond the ""small hills and bushes"" that could be argued as ""disputed"" by some. 

Western states immediately recognized it as a clear violation of Armenia's territorial integrity and demanded the withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces. 

An anonymous ranking CSTO official recently made it clear that CSTO didn't help Armenia because Azerbaijan considers those territories disputed and as long as Armenia and Azerbaijan do not agree around their borders and resolve it themselves, the CSTO won't help Armenia.

Under that logic, if Japan attacks Russia in the area where they have not demarcated their borders, and the Japanese army reaches all the way to Vladivostok just as Azerbaijan did to Jermuk, and if Russia requests dear CSTO for help, should we tell Mr. Lavrov to go clarify his borders with Japan?

##Nagorno-Karabakh's pro-Russian parliamentary parties express concern about the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers 

**PARTIES:** The process of the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping troops from the territory of the occupied Artsakh Republic is very concerning for the 150,000 Artsakh citizens who were displaced from their homeland months ago under the real threat of genocide.  

For the legitimate authorities elected by the people of the Republic of Artsakh and factions of the parliament, the issue of dignified return has been and continues to be a priority, and the guarantee of our fundamental rights and security is of cornerstone importance.

The people of Artsakh became trapped by the provisions of the November 9 declaration and believed in the assurances of the Russian top leadership to ensure its security. We are forced to record with pain and regret that the fate of the people of Artsakh became a secondary issue for all the parties that signed the Nov. 9 agreement, due to which Artsakh was completely depopulated in September 2023. //

The parties want the Russian government to launch a dialogue with them ASAP to discuss the reasons for withdrawal.

**SELLER:** Whaaaaaat? You better go after the talanchi instead.

**INSPECTOR (to reporters):** We patrol every day and urge them to stop but there are some who violate the law regularly. The people you saw today were warned 100-150 times and had their stuff confiscated 10-15 times already. You saw how they sold fish in the open air on a sidewalk under everyone's feet. Their excuse is that they have to do this to make a living, but we have offered them employment with high wages in the city departments; we are hiring. If they don't want to work for the city, they can sell their products in one of the 26 legal markets in the city. Why should they be more privileged than law-abiding sellers?

##for the first time in one billion years, two lifeforms were caught merging into one organism: scientists

This rare event occurred between a marine algae and a bacterium in a lab. For perspective, last time this happened, the Earth got plants.

Primary endosymbiosis happens when one microbial organism engulfs another. It then begins to use the swallowed organism as an internal organ. 

The host provides it with nutrients, energy, and protection. When the swallowed microorganism can no longer survive on its own, it becomes an organ for the host. 

This endosymbiosis has only happened three known times. All of these instances were a major breakthroughs for evolution.

##... the first event 

It was 2.2 billion years ago. A single-celled organism swallowed up a bacterium and eventually became the mitochondria. Its formation allowed for complex organisms to evolve. 

##... the second event 

About 1.6 billion years ago, more advanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria. One thing led to another, and it gained sunlight-harvesting abilities and led to the birth of plants.

##... the third event

With this latest endosymbiosis event, it‚Äôs possible that the algae is converting nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia that it can use for other cellular processes, and it needs the help of the bacterium.

Even earlier than that, the cyanobacteria potosynthesizing filled the atmosphere with oxygen which killed off most species. And I don't think anyone in their right mind is saying that plants and cyanobacteria are demonic species that hurt the planet and all the other human-hating bullshit we are fed today. I think climate change is a propaganda tool to virtue signal against people by the rich and to distract people from rising inequality. Christianity was also used by the rich to tell regular people they were ""sinners and evil and deserved punishment and were going to hell unless they did as they were told"". ""Climate change"" is just the new bullshit. We are just a massively succesful species, and historically that means climate change and mass extinction. Nothing inherently wrong with that.

  
EDIT: To everyone saying ""oh you are just selfish you think it's indifferent because it won't affect you"", you are completely misinterpreting my argument. The point was more along the lines of the fact that since climate change and its prevention has become one of the main political talking points, it displaces more important issues, namely inequality (which, as one commenter pointed out, underlies climate change). It also makes it easy for rich people to virtue signal and say ""oh no we are very good because we are now investing in this shiny bullshit to prevent climate change. Please nevermind the private jets or military operations or Mr Epstein's private island. The evil ones are those pesky Chinese burning coal.""

Two months ago I posted asking for help with Walter, my office's fish and I got some great suggestions and I followed them to a T. We had a successful fish-in cycle that lasted 6 weeks and it's now been 3 weeks of stable water parameters. Ammonia:0ppm, Nitrite: 0ppm and Nitrate: < 10ppm.
I want to slowly start introducing live plants to his tank and get rid of the fake ones, however. I have noticed a growth of dark green algae (which I think might be cyanobacteria). I read that it can be treated with Erythromycin. So I was wondering if it would be safe for me to treat the tank with API E.M. Erythromycin before I introduce any plants?

Other info: Walter seems to be doing better, co-workers tell me he gets excited about food again. However, he spends most of his time at the bottom of his tank, on top of the filter or hiding in a rock hide. I also feel like there hasn't been much improvement on his color and fins.",19 Apr 2024 00:02:09,reddit

After the tank cleared up (again) I put in some plant food and quick start to get things moving. After being stuck at 1ppm ammonia for a few days, I added more beneficial bacteria.

279,https://i.redd.it/hbs8on4wwkuc1.jpeg,Has anyone visited Grand Prismatic Springs at Yellowstone? ,"Unlike the water at Cotorra Springs the water in these aquifers is hot enough to boil the meat off your bones, as a few visitors unfortunately find out from time to time, if they're not gored by bison first. These waters are heated by the potentially violent and devastatingly eruptive Yellowstone magma hotspot below, a region of the Earth's crust that is being melted by the underlying mantle.

Nevertheless rich ecosystems of microrganisms have evolved to live along the gradient of high temperatures within the geyser water and springs and are responsible for the deep zones of coloration. These thermophilic microbes, many of which are photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria and Archaea are also differentialy adapted to the pH gradients that are present. Essentially the coloration is due to pigments in the microbes that selectively absorb and/or reflect different wavelengths of light. This protects the cells from the intense sunlight. 

Finally because of Covid most people are familiar with the PCR test, which had already revolutionized biotechnology and medical research long before 2019. These microorganisms, however, revolutionized the PCR procedure. PCR imitates the copying of DNA that goes on when cells replicate and divide, but rather than using enzymes to pull apart the double stranded DNA, a PCR device uses heat to break hydrogen bonds and separate DNA strands, much like heat separates the molecules in a pan of water when you boil it. Unfortunately the heat also takes its toll on the enzymes used to copy DNA. It literally cooks them. Early on someone realized that they could  use the DNA copying enzymes purified from these microbes and it would mean not having to replenish by adding fresh enzyme after each hot cycle in the PCR program.

287,https://i.redd.it/4o0r7ui38xsc1.jpeg,Alternate History/Timeline; a Clockwise Spinning Earth,"Context;

This is the premise of an alternate history or evolution project, centering around the idea of a world where the Earth spins clockwise, or ‚Äúbackward‚Äù, something that is known as retrograde rotation, similar to Venus. This doesn‚Äôt focus on what caused this to happen, but it instead focuses on geographical changes related to climate and weather changes between the two timelines, some similar and some dramatically different to our timeline. How the plants and animals of this world would adapt to all the changes.

Me and Molotovsnowman have gone through yet more scrutiny with regards to our previous data, especially by using the videos from the 2018 study data to measure using better software such as paint.net and climate simulation software so that we can more accurately measure the climate of this world. If a more up to date and powerful study looks at this premise with higher resolution, this will likely become obsolete, as the squares the studies use are quite big and make averages.

Using this more precise measuring, we‚Äôve modified some of the temperate and humidity values of certain places, particularly with regard to precipitation patterns and seasonal variations, showing exactly how these places vary between seasons. As a result this helps us come to think about what would be living in these places. In future we will do an updated biome map that covers exactly what kind of ecosystems would be prevalent on such a world.

Molotov did some dats analysison the rainfall pattern of this timeline, determining not only the overall rainfall of certain places, but also what times of the year in which they fall significantly in, as can be seen the rainfall gif near the end of the slideshow, showing areas of intense rainfall in each month of the year.

Before this is a graph showing some of the wettest places in this timeline. Some of these are very wet year round, such as Ascension Island and coastal southwest Africa as a whole, or the Indus Valley, now a subtropical rainforest akin to a wetter southern China. Others are more monsoonal with pronounced dry seasons, which as the dry forests of the former Sahel and Arabia, now akin to our India or Southeast Asia. The flora and fauna of these lands would undoubtedly be a mix of subsaharan, Indian and even European migrants.

Just because a place doesn‚Äôt register on the humidity gif doesn‚Äôt mean there is no rain in this seasons, it means that it is not a significant or ‚Äòmonsoonal‚Äô quantity, with the picture before it showing places that received a lot of rain.

Hawaii is an interesting example; at first it appears only slightly warmer and wetter on average than in our timeline, but in practise, it has gone from a rare dry summer savannah variant (As in the Koppen-Geiger system) to a more typical dry winter variant (Aw), with resulting changes in flora happening as a result. 
Similarly, the Iberian peninsula maintains rainfall from the Mediterranean monsoon, while also getting an Atlantic rain during winter, keeping it notably more humid than in our timeline. However, the harsh winters of Europe (keep in mind the temperature gif is skewed somewhat by elevation averages) mean that continental climates are far more prevalent. Other changed islands are a much drier and somewhat cooler Madagascar, Taiwan and Mauritius, a far wetter Galapagos and Socotra, a wetter and monsoonal Cyprus, and a strangely oceanic Mediterranean Japan, including southern Sakhalin. Other tropical islands like Indonesia haven‚Äôt changed too much, a result of low latitude.

My own gif creation involves a demonstration of how temperatures have altered in their distribution in this timeline. As can be seen by my monthly averages graph, winter temperatures in Europe and British Columbia are much harsher than in our timeline, but the reverse is true for the eastern coasts of America and Asia. An interesting fluke is the Mediterranean Sea, which helps moderate the hardness of Europe and North Africa, allowing much of that region to have relatively mild winters. Similarly, surrounded by oceans, the now monsoonal Arabia doesn‚Äôt vary as much as our India in temperatures, with only some of the southern regions averaging above 27C and only for a short time, while even Syria, Cycilia and Kurdistan remain above 2C in January.

Western Europe is a far cry from ours, with parts of northern Britain remaining below 2C until June, while the Italian peninsula is mostly very seasonal, akin to our Korea or New England roughly. Eastern Europe is even colder and harsher, with all of Europe north of the Seine being taiga forest. Tundras stretch down into Norway, while temperate forests cling on in southern Europe and Crimea. The cool and dry Caucasus remains a steppe, as does a cooler Central Asia, akin to pre-Reversal Mongolia. 

Australia has certainly changed too; a cooler and much wetter west and warmer east is present; the desert is still present, but is now focussed in the east and has shrunk considerably to the benefit of the savannahs of the north and subtropical woodlands of the west. The continent now resembles how it did during the early Pliocene, and like it sees a resurgence in declining groups. This region would definitely be more capable of higher population in this timeline.

South America has dramatically changed in some places. The Amazon still exists, but is smaller and less dense than before, more like our Congo, while the savannahs have shifted northward. North Brazil is now dominated by the world‚Äôs largest desert, akin to the Outback, though the La Plata river offers a lifeline through this, ideal ground for urban societies to develop. The same is true for the Orinoco in Venezuela, now akin to our Indus. The western coast on the other hand is much wetter, the Galapagos and Atacama now being rainforest and coastal Peru‚Äôs deserts are now savannah. Valvidia is colder and drier, while Patagonia has become temperate forest. 

As before, the Sahara is mild and wet, but it wasn‚Äôt clear until now how mild it is, with even the Maghreb (part from the highlands) being around 7C or above in winter and only slightly above 22C in summer, and year round humidity making akin to the southeastern USA of our timeline. The drier Egypt region is nearer 14C in January, allowing easy plant growth if one is ok with the winter dry season. Further south, the former Sahel has mostly changed into an intensely monsoonal region, akin to India or Indochina but in an even larger scale, with lake Chad not being too dissimilar to our Thailand climatically. Only the western Sahel is relatively similar. A vast savannah larger than all those south of the Sahara combined exists in these regions, allowing easy flow of African animals northward and beyond. The Great Lakes region is slightly wetter than before, but the Horn is an outright rainforest, while the southeast and Madagascar are much drier and more hostile now. Rainforests stretch down the coast all the way down to Angola and even Namibia. The Congo has now supplanted the Amazon as the world‚Äôs largest rainforest, and deserves a new name to boot; the Azanian. This has now taken the savannah‚Äôs place as the main division between Africa. 

Don‚Äôt take these temperatures too perfectly, however, as they do seem to(based on the prograde simulations in the same study) to exaggerate the extreme summers of hot desert climates in a way not seen elsewhere in the study data, as well as possibly continentality. It underestimates winter temperatures in prograde British Columbia while overestimating those of northern Japan for example. This is why Molotov simulated only coastal Iberia to be temperate rather than continental. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of southern Europe is still fairly mild despite the vast changes. Also keep in mind these assume preindustrial co2 levels and climate, with this world on average being 1.24C cooler globally than ours currently is.

Some of the most extreme temperature swings are present in Central Asia, home to summers almost as harsh as in our timeline, but considerably stronger winters, akin to the Midwest, creating ideal environments for tornados. Even more extreme is Northern European Russia, with summers only being above 2C on average for a meagre 3-4 months of the year, followed by bitter winters, akin to our Yakutia. Even the Caucasus and Anatolia are cold and continental, with only coastal Anatolia being still warm and mild, allowing a pathway for fleeing European flora and fauna to migrate to the Middle East.

Meanwhile, the Asian far east has become much milder than before, at least in the north; not to the extent of our Europe but still a vast improvement. Southern Manchuria and North Korea reach or surpass 22C for 3 months (compared to 2 in otl) and all 12 months average above 2C (compared to 3 averaging below 0C in otl). This along with flat land and a decent Mediterranean rainfall pattern of sunny dry summers and mild rainy winters makes this good land for early civilisation to form, as is the Yellow River basin to the south. Manchuria both inner and outer quickly becomes more continental as you go further inland, just as with our timeline (something the squares of the study videos do tend to skew a bit), but even parts of outer Manchuria are now temperate, while the bits that are still continental are now relatively mild and easy to handle for creatures, similar to Eastern Europe. Deciduous woodlands now grow as far as and even beyond (at least near the coasts) the Stanavoys. Even Mongolia is relatively milder than our own; slightly wetter and with weaker winters than before, its mountains providing refuge from the blistering heat of the south. The Yellow Sea is like a much smaller Mediterranean here, and like it has a great desert to the south, though not nearly as big or harsh as our Sahara, harbouring a Sahelian Indochina to the south. Indonesia is relatively drier than before, especially Sumatra but remains very humid and forested despite minor changes. Japan‚Äôs islands are very oceanic, with only the southwest having hot summers, while all of the islands, including not only Hokkaido, but the Kurils and the southern half of Sakhalin having mild winters that allow easy plant and crop growth. Even southern kamchatka now has an oceanic climate, akin to British Columbia or Ireland. 

The Indian subcontinent apart from the aforementioned rainforests of the northwest, hasn‚Äôt changed too much at all in the north, but the south and Sri Lanka are substantially wetter as seen in the study data, now being one of the wettest places on earth, a large rainforest. In addition, sea nitration occurs on a level unheard of in our timeline here, leading to unprecedented Cyanobacteria blooms off the coast. 

The west coast of North America now has one of the world‚Äôs largest monsoons affecting it, though not quite as large and intense as the East Asian monsoon of our timeline. Only California still recieves decent rain during the winters now, a very stark contrast. Southern Cascadia, with a strong continental shift, resembles a milder Manchuria now, and Columbia is akin to the Russian far east, harsh and hostile to outsiders, though a warmer and milder Aleutians catches the brunt of the Mid-Pacific current, being relatively nice to dwell in. California and the southwest resemble an even more mountainous southern China in miniature form, and Baja takes Florida‚Äôs place. Animals of southern and western Mexico now roam around California without issues, as well as refugees from the desertified southeast. The Midwest and Great Lakes is a wild place of hot and dry summers and freezing winters, similar to our Central Asia, while the midatlantic and New England are Mediterranean. Even Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are now temperate, and coastal Labrador and the Hudson Bay coastline are little bit milder than in our timeline, the opposite of their west coast counterparts.

290,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecosphere/comments/1bu3x2z/eternal_algae_ecosphere_elder/,eternal algae ecosphere (elder),"hello, some of you have already seen that I made a post about my oldest aquatic ecosphere, and in one of the photos, there is an ecosystem with yellowish water and a lot of soil, and that's what I'm going to talk about, in case you haven't seen the other one post I will put the link in the comments, ok :)

This pot was assembled on December 30, 2021 (2 years and 3 months), together with another pot (the smallest pot of the 3). When setting up, I added a lot of water and a leaf that was outside the lake where I got it, just to see what happened.

I can describe this ecosphere as: ""a pump of nutrients that are in constant recycling and with countless algae and other beings taking advantage of this high dose of nutrients to thrive. Worms and ostracoda come out of the soil/hiding places in warm periods and graze or eat any organic debris and algae that they find. Colonies and biofilms of bacteria inhabit the soil and the airy part of the ecosystem (?), caves that previously existed are buried by debris, with only 1 large cave in the back. plains and mesas are formed in the ecosystem, in addition to 2 distinct biomes above ground"".

Since its beginning, its water has always been cloudy, and all beings that were not copepods, worms, ostracods, died quickly. Due to the enormous amount of algae and nutrients, copepods/cyclopods and ostracods lived in peace and harmony for a long time. The water in these biospheres became clear twice, and on both occasions, it was possible to see the mountain that was forming in the front of the pot and the countless worms that inhabited that environment, along with the leaf. The atmosphere was dynamic and beautiful.....even a cold week.

In the same week that there was a kick-off for the great extinction in the ""peaceful pastures"" pot, the ""eternal algae ecosphere"" also went through the extinction process, only surprisingly, the ecosphere suffered practically no serious damage, like its companion , there was only the extinction of copepods and one species of ostracoda.

Currently, the pot is healthy and has a huge population of ostracoda and worms, which dig into the new soil that was created from the remains of the decomposition of organic matter, the leaf, was buried by the detritus and must now be completely decomposed. The ostracods swim and hit the algal mist that has created at the back of the pot, and the colonies of bacteria and algae that have formed beneath the soil are stable and have apparently created an ""ecosystem"", along with the biofilm. and the algae colony that is above the water level. In front of the pot, a large film of cyanobacteria is growing and creating a biome of its own.

This pot is the youngest of the ancients and is the most mysterious, a cool fact is that when I went to take the photos, I noticed that the water in the pot is clearer than in summer (here in Brazil it is autumn, we changed seasons recently) , then the pot may have clear water soon.

Black algae in pools is the species of algae that mainly develops in both indoor and outdoor swimming pools due to the appropriate temperature and humidity. ""Cyanobacteria,"" scientifically known, shows a dark black or blue-green rash on the surface of a pool, especially walls and crevices. Attaching deeply to the pool's surfaces, black algae can become a nuisance as they grow up towards the water. This condition explains their ability to live in chlorinated water and withstand brushing. It usually grows best in areas with poor circulation, low sunlight, and very low chlorine concentrations.

And I wanted to show you the history and what the ecosphere is like today. Just letting you know that the story will be about the things I remember, so we'll have some time holes, showing only the important things. Having made all that clear, let's move on to the story.

It was created on November 28, 2021, in a pot that wasn't airtight (hence the bunch of ribbons and little water), it's still a plant that I thought was aquatic. At the beginning (decantation and first months), it was on a sill in my window, receiving direct sunlight - only for a short time - then I noticed the larvae that lived there and even a flatworm (it died without leaving any descendants).

After decanting and staying on my balcony (where it is today) it contained A LOT of life, in a way that seemed to already have an ecosystem...... until that winter.....

In a cold week, somehow, all the filamentous algae died and this must have acidified the water (?) and killed a large part of the beings (from copepods to worms and some ostracoda and what was left of larvae), this devastated it to a point where a lump of dead algae that formed in the center did not decompose and remained in the jar for almost 1 YEAR. What was left was just mites and worms that died quickly. Today, a mat of cyanobacteria formed and some ostracoda eggs hatched, causing the species to thrive to this day.

Today, we have a stable ecosystem with euglenas (I forgot to mention them), a species of ostracoda (in Brazil - where I live - they are more resistant than copepods), a species of mite and 3 species of algae (which I identified). Besides a little orange ball that I don't know what it is.

Anyway, this is the ecosphere that I like to call ""peaceful pasture"", an ecosphere with a history that is far from calm and with some changes of destiny. It's a long post, but I wanted to share the story of this pot with someone and this subreddit is perfect. Anyway, thanks for reading and until next time, in the meantime, photos of the peaceful pasture :)

297,https://www.reddit.com/r/terraforming/comments/1brwxe5/creating_a_permanent_atmosphere_on_the_moon_from/,Creating a permanent atmosphere on the Moon from lunar industrialization,"I believe it is possible to terraform the Moon, or at least make the Moon far more habitable than it currently is.

One of the biggest problems with terraforming the Moon is that it does not have enough gravity to hold onto a breathable atmosphere for more than a few hundred years. However, some gases, such as xenon, are able to stay gravitationally bound to the moon. These gases could potentially last for millions of years, as the only force acting to remove them is solar wind.

Lighter gases are accelerated faster than heavier ones, and reach planetary escape velocities easier. This is why Earth doesn't have a hydrogen or helium atmosphere.

Molecules with higher molarity tend to move at lower speeds. Therefore, in the Moon's case, any gas with a molar mass greater than xenon will be gravitationally bound to the Moon. Luckily, there are hundreds of gases that are heavier than xenon, and can be mass-produced by manufacturing processes

The idea is once we colonize the moon and set up manufacturing hubs for mining helium-3 and taking advantage of making things in low-gravity, we emit tons of gaseous byproducts, mostly CO2 and methane, but also trace amounts of heavier molecules, which stay on the Moon and accumulate over time.

Then maybe after a few thousand years, the moon has enough heavy gases accumulated in it's atmosphere that the moon has a sky, liquid water can exist on the surface, and you can walk on the Moon without a spacesuit and just a hazmat suit.

There are several benefits to having an atmosphere on the moon, even if it is not breathable.

- Lunar dust loses it's static electricity

- Regolith can become clumpier and easier to use

- Protection from micrometeorites

- Protection from extreme day/night temperature changes

- Extra protection from cosmic radiation

- Moon bases won't explode if seriously ruptured

We could potentially even genetically engineer extremophilic cyanobacteria to metabolize the chemicals in the air and water to produce food or even small amounts of breathable air.",30 Mar 2024 20:24:45,reddit

300,https://i.redd.it/lh0vzdm0n4rc1.png,I'm on earliest stages of building my world. And I need several thoughts,"Hi there! You may think that this is an image of ancient eldritch horror but, actually, it is a map. Well, a sketch of a map of my fantasy world (part of it). But if your eyes start bleeding after you see this image - I think it's a compliment for me! Ok. So, white is ground, black is water. For context - this sketch was prepared for Wonderdraft, so this is a reason for such an interesting choice of color.

Oh, and I should say that I already made a post with this map more than a year ago, but I was lazy enough all that time to make nothing with it. Plus my doubts. Plus overthinking. Plus bad ideas that I couldn't reject for quite  a long time.. Though, I decided to return to that project and make something already.

Well, the main reason why I‚Äôm making this post is because I want to know if my ideas are interesting enough for people. And I have some ideas that I think are questionable.  I need someone's clear sight. So, all this long text is quite a boring bunch of facts about Akuma - my fantasy world. First of all - Akuma means ""evil spirit"" or ""devil"" in japanese. I suggest, this is the perfect name for this planet.

This planet is the third moon of a brown dwarf, and I can call it ""moon"" because the brown dwarf itself orbits a red dwarf star making this star system binary. There are three planets between red dwarf (RD) and brown dwarf (BD). RD is slightly heavier than half of the sun. BD has a mass of 54 Jupiters. All three planets between them are lighter than Earth. 

BD has six moons (or planets if you want). 5 of them are lighter than Earth, third is Akuma and 6 is, interestingly - a gas giant with moon. I made a model of this system in Universe Sandbox so it seems quite realistic despite being quite unlikely.

Well, I don't know of any real star system similar to it - no brown dwarf was found in such a strange configuration with a red dwarf. But I make it with purpose (!!!). Like, I want my fantasy world to be ""dark and spooky"" but I want it to be scientifically possible and still good enough for highly developed forms of life. Though most of its people evolved here good enough to live with all its ""spookiness'' without any problem. (Dark lighting from the planet's stars isn't the biggest problem). Forgot to say that Akuma has a mass of 77% of Earth.

So Akuma's environment is affected by both RD and BD. Needless to say that Akuma is tidally locked. And I work with half of the planet that can't see BD. So people here don't even know that they live on ""moon-like object"". Akuma's orbital period is 26 hours. The orbital period of BD around RD is 217 earthly days. 

While modeling in Universe Sandbox I make sure that Akuma's temperature is good enough for life, though in this model BD had an orbital period of 183 days. Well, it's slightly more than half of our year so I thought it was kinda boring. So I assumed that the effects of BD can expand the habitable zone for Akuma so I make BD's orbital period longer - 217 days. So Akuma's year is still lesser than Venus' year but its day is two hours longer than ours. 201 local days.

RD makes the sky on this planet reddish. And people here can see the brightest stars even during daytime. Scientists say that stars here might appear blue, but, well, if you were born in a red dwarf system and all your ancestors too, I suppose you wouldn't be able to see blue, green, and purple, and maybe all colors that are higher on the spectrum than orange and, maybe, yellow. You won't even know what it is.. It definitely creates some problems for my future writing‚Ä¶

Because of the red light, plants on Akuma are red or black. Plants' color depends on the environment and height, so some plants here are really brighty red and some are blacker than my soul. Like, plants in the mountains are red, because they need more protection from sunlight while plants in the lowest part of forest are quite black because for them catching sunlight is definitely uneasy. Well, I assume, there are no other specific effects of RD on the Akuma surface.

The impact of BD is interesting too. Every fucking day Akuma fluctuates. Because of BD's gravitation. You know, planets' orbits are not exactly round, so they have some part where they are closer to their parent object and part where it's farther. So to be short: every 26 hours of Akuma's day/night cycle (its orbital period) gravitation of BD stretches and squeezes it. Well, there is quite a big chance that in reality such a planet becomes hellish as Venus or Io...  

So BD's gravitation creates a lot of inner heat under Akuma's crust and this makes it warmer but consequence of it is quite wild tectonic activity. Volcanoes everywhere!!! And volcanic winters... sometimes. Earthquakes here and there... Such kind of stuff. Well, if you wondering why shape of continents on my map is such... strange, it is because of fucking BD's gravitation that plays with Akuma as dog with a ball. Plus I assume that gravitation of the nearest to Akuma planets have its effects too. And that creates unpredictable tides. Well...

Besides, BD has an electromagnetic field (EMF), and, considering the mass of BD I suggest that it's massive and powerful as fuck. Akuma is big enough to have its own EMF, and I suggest that interaction of two EMFs creates interesting effects. I just hope that they are not deadly for the planet's life and most importantly - intelligent life.

Well. BDs EMF protects Akuma from dangerous cosmic stuff and first of all - RD's solar storms. And aurora borealis everywhere!!! Sick waves of light across the skies almost everyday! I don't know if there can be some pattern of aurora's appearance so I just assume it's an unpredictable phenomenon. I think it's possible to see other similar phenomena here. I mean, phenomena with electromagnetic and/or electric nature. Ball lightning for example, sprites and so on. And that stuff is really frequent here. 

Because of the powerful presence of EMF it's quite hard to establish a high technological civilization on Akuma. Well, tbh it's impossible. Electromagnetic storms and stuff. It could look pretty in the skies but, you know, EMF kills all electronics here. I have plot trope with aliens that come to this planet long time ago and got fucked up by it. 

I suppose that local plant and animal life found some ways to use EMF for themselves. Like, for example, predators that can find prey by electric signals, or plants or mushrooms that use electromagnetic induction for its benefit.

Oh. I need to say that because of BD's EMF Akuma's polar regions are terrible for living. U know - it's like life in Chornobyl zone but worse. Polar regions are much more affected by EMF than others, so not many things can live here.

I suppose that the temperature of BD has some effect on Akuma too but, considering the nature of those objects and its evolution, I suggest, it's not so big. But, who knows? It's still quite a big relatively warm object, not an actual star though, but, well, it makes Akuma warmer than it could be.

And I have more!

Another distinctive feature of Akuma are its mushrooms. Giant mushrooms, actually. Well, I just slightly OBSESSED(!!!) with mushrooms so Akuma has different forms and types of them. 

I suppose I can justify its size by the environmental conditions of Akuma. You know, all those volcanoes release a lot of carbon material. CO2 at least. Mushrooms store it in their mycelium. Plus, well, maybe some of them have symbiotic relationships with some bacteria/cyanobacteria and/or lichen. And maybe volcanic emissions can be used by mushrooms quite well as ""food"". 

Mushrooms here create quite a wide and deep web of mycelium. I mean, this network may be stretching under the entire surface of the planet. This network is one of the main reasons why life is possible here despite all those shit as fucking volcanos with toxic gases and high as fuck greenhouse effect. I need to say that even in the earliest stages of worldbuilding when I didn't really know what kind of world I was trying to create, I had this idea of some ""World Tree"", though, ""dark"" variant of it. So this mycelium network is Akuma's ""World Tree"", Yggdrasil-like entity, though it is mushroom and it's mostly horizontal, plus kinda growing down - to the depths.

And now I go to the most problematic element of this world - this element is the main reason for my doubts and unproductive overthinking. Climate system of Akuma.

You know, our climate depends mostly on Earth's axis, so seasons exist because the axis is changing its incline through the year. Because of the short orbital period and strong gravitation of BD, the axial tilt of Akuma is 0. Maybe I should change the axial tilt of BD so it can change the orbital incline of all its satellites? Well, no. The orbital period of BD is shorter than Earth's, and its orbit is round almost perfectly because of it. I mean - seasonal changes on Akuma could still be quite unrecognizable even if BD has a bigger axial tilt. Plus - the big axial tilt of BD and its ""moons"" makes the whole system really unstable so everything just flies in different directions after several dozen years. 

Did I say I made modeling in Universe Sandbox?

So, our more ""traditional"" climate system doesn't work here on Akuma. I mean, in normal realistic conditions Akuma's climate is quite unchangeable, without seasons. Well, sometimes volcanic winter/s happens. Though it's unpredictable. And it's sooo boring!!! Fucking eternal summer!!! But I, seemingly, found a way!

Let's go back to the mushrooms! And to the volcanos! So, as it was said before, gravitation of BD makes Akuma fluctuate as accordion (?), because its orbit isn't perfectly round. That's create a lot of inner heat and more tectonic activity, volcanos and stuff. In turn that creates a greenhouse effect and fills the planet's atmosphere with a lot of CO2, methane and different toxic shit. 

And here mushrooms come into play! I mean - those fucking giant network of mycelium under Akuma's surface and ""normal"" mushrooms too absorb those gases, well, by using symbiotic organisms (bacteria, algae or lichen) or maybe by direct interaction of mycelium with plant roots... I don't know exactly how... 

This mycelium network protects the planet's lifeforms from dangerous greenhouse effect, stabilizes temperature and humidity and, possibly, recycles toxic elements of volcanic activity into something useful. And, moreover, mushroom-mycelium network creates seasonal changes. Somehow. And for some reason. 

I mean, this network has lifecycles that make its absorption (?) capacity sometimes worse and sometimes better so there is part of a year when greenhouse effect affects planet more and other part when it's not so bad. Well, mycelium lifecycles creates seasonal changes on Akuma. But I suppose this change is still not as drastic as Earth's so it looks like tropical seasons with small transition periods in-between. Ok. 

I hope all those bullshit is understandable enough. Akuma's climate system isn't simple. This is actually the main reason why I still can't make another step in my worldbuilding process. I need someone who can say something about it.

So, what do we have here? Planet in the strange star system, with reddish sky and red and black plants, with giant mushrooms all over the place. Volcanoes and different electromagnetic stuff happen here. And volcanic winters... Not the best place to live. If you think that this planet looks like Hell - you are right! It definitely is!

Well. That's not all. It is a fantasy setting and what a fantasy without magic? Yeap, there is magic here. Considering all BD's effects I suppose that local magic exists because of it. So here on Akuma a lot of anomalous places can be found. You know, all of this stuff with tectonic faults, ley lines, mysterious zones... So, polar regions are big fucking territories FULL of anomalies! 

All gods, spirits, demons and even souls could be considered as sentient anomalies. Well, I'm still thinking about magical stuff. I have an idea of ""Dreamlands"" or ""Dream realm"", and, well, it mostly exists in dreams (or mind) of... giant mycelium web! But almost nobody knows it. I'm not sure that fungi need sleep though... So a lot of magic is connected with sleep and dreams. But mostly with different electromagnetic shit. 

I can‚Äôt say much about Akuma‚Äôs magic system just because I still haven't come up with something interesting. 

I don't think it's time to speak about local races, history and cultures, because, again, I still have doubts about the most fundamental elements of this world. This is the reason why I made this post. Doubts. Overthinking. Inability to make any progress‚Ä¶

I hope that‚Äôs all is understandable enough. I have worked with this world since 2019 and most of the time was wasted on research and modeling. This was interesting work though, but it‚Äôs time to do something more and start write a fucking story! Well, firstly I need to build the world's history, cultures, and create interesting characters‚Ä¶ Sometimes it‚Äôs all become quite frustrating. So. What do you think?",28 Mar 2024 15:31:40,reddit

From removing harmful pollutants to recycling water for reuse, these services have far-reaching benefits that positively impact communities worldwide.

**Environmental Sustainability:**

1. **Pollution Control**: Wastewater treatment services help remove pollutants and contaminants from wastewater before it is discharged into rivers, lakes, and oceans. This prevents the contamination of natural water bodies, preserving aquatic ecosystems and biodiversity.
2. **Nutrient Removal**: Wastewater treatment facilities remove excess nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, which can otherwise cause harmful algal blooms and disrupt aquatic ecosystems. By reducing nutrient pollution, these services help maintain water quality and ecosystem balance.
3. **Water Conservation**: Many wastewater treatment plants utilize advanced technologies to treat and recycle wastewater for various purposes, such as irrigation, industrial processes, and even drinking water supply. This reduces the strain on freshwater resources and promotes sustainable water management practices.

**Public Health:**

1. **Disease Prevention**: Proper wastewater treatment eliminates harmful pathogens and bacteria from sewage, reducing the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis. This protects public health and ensures safe drinking water for communities.
2. **Toxic Chemical Removal**: Wastewater treatment processes also target toxic chemicals and pollutants, such as heavy metals, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals, which can pose significant health risks if released into the environment. By removing these contaminants, treatment services help safeguard public health and prevent long-term health impacts.
3. **Air Quality Improvement**: Some wastewater treatment facilities utilize anaerobic digestion or other processes to generate biogas, a renewable energy source. By capturing methane emissions from wastewater, these facilities not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions but also improve air quality in surrounding areas.

F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel, ""The Great Gatsby,"" is a classic work of American literature that explores themes of love, wealth, and the pursuit of the American Dream in the Roaring Twenties. While the novel is primarily a social commentary on the excesses and disillusionments of the Jazz Age, it also offers insights into ecosystem ecology and the interconnectedness of human activities with natural systems. This essay examines the intersections between ""The Great Gatsby,"" ecosystem ecology, biogeochemical cycles (specifically the hydrologic, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus cycles), and human impacts on the environment.

""The Great Gatsby"": Wealth, Excess, and Ecological Disruption

""The Great Gatsby"" is set in the wealthy enclaves of Long Island, New York, during the 1920s, a time of unprecedented economic prosperity and cultural upheaval in the United States. The novel follows the story of Jay Gatsby, a mysterious millionaire, and his pursuit of the American Dream, as narrated by his neighbor, Nick Carraway.

At its core, ""The Great Gatsby"" is a story about wealth, excess, and moral decay in American society. The characters in the novel live extravagant lifestyles, characterized by lavish parties, opulent mansions, and reckless behavior. However, beneath the surface of this glittering facade lies a world of moral ambiguity, social inequality, and ecological disruption.

Ecosystem Ecology: Interactions, Dynamics, and Feedbacks

Ecosystem ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and their physical environment to form self-regulating systems. Ecosystems are comprised of biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact and exchange energy and nutrients through various biogeochemical cycles.

In ""The Great Gatsby,"" the ecosystem of Long Island is depicted as a microcosm of the larger American landscape, characterized by human activities such as urbanization, industrialization, and agricultural expansion. The interactions between human society and the natural environment have profound effects on the health and stability of local ecosystems.

Biogeochemical Cycles: Hydrologic, Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus

Biogeochemical cycles are pathways through which elements such as water, carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus are exchanged between living organisms, the atmosphere, the hydrosphere (water bodies), and the lithosphere (rock and soil). These cycles play a critical role in regulating Earth's climate, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem functioning.



 The hydrologic cycle describes the movement of water through the atmosphere, land, and oceans, driven by processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. In ""The Great Gatsby,"" the characters' extravagant lifestyles and excessive water use contribute to the degradation of local water resources, such as the polluted waters of the Long Island Sound.

The carbon cycle describes the movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, soil, and living organisms through processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, and decomposition. In ""The Great Gatsby,"" the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and gasoline, contributes to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and global climate change, as depicted by the smoky industrial landscape of the East Egg.

The nitrogen and phosphorus cycles describe the movement of these essential nutrients through the atmosphere, soil, water, and living organisms. In ""The Great Gatsby,"" agricultural runoff from nearby farms leads to eutrophication of water bodies such as the East Egg Bay, resulting in algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and fish kills.

Human Impacts on the Environment: Urbanization, Pollution, Deforestation, Climate Change, and Habitat Destruction

Human activities have significant impacts on the environment, including habitat destruction, pollution, deforestation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. In ""The Great Gatsby,"" these impacts are depicted through the lens of human society's excesses and moral decay.

Urbanization and industrialization lead to habitat destruction and fragmentation, as natural landscapes are converted into urban developments, roads, and industrial zones. Pollution from industrial activities, such as coal mining and factory emissions, contributes to air and water pollution, as depicted by the smoky, polluted skies and waters of Long Island.

Deforestation and agricultural expansion lead to loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction, as natural ecosystems are cleared for urban development, agriculture, and timber extraction. Climate change, driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, leads to global warming, sea level rise, and extreme weather events.

Conclusion

""The Great Gatsby"" offers valuable insights into the interconnectedness of human society and the natural environment, highlighting the ways in which human activities impact local ecosystems and global biogeochemical cycles. By examining the intersections between literature, ecosystem ecology,



 biogeochemical cycles, and human impacts on the environment, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of human-nature interactions and the importance of environmental stewardship and sustainability in shaping our collective future.

As we navigate the challenges of the 21st century, it is essential to recognize the ways in which our actions affect the health and stability of ecosystems around the world. By promoting conservation, sustainable development, and responsible stewardship of natural resources, we can work towards a more equitable, resilient, and sustainable future for all. Just as the characters in ""The Great Gatsby"" grapple with the consequences of their actions, so too must we confront the ecological realities of our time and strive to build a better world for future generations.",10 May 2024 09:50:23,reddit

These trash islands are killing untold millions of creatures and changing the ecosystems of the ocean for the worse. Our monocrop agriculture systems are stripping the soils world wide of nutrients to the point the dirt is basically just a vessel for fertilizer. Every time there is a large rain event near the coast of any major agriculture area those fertilizers are flushed into the oceans, lakes, and rivers causing massive imbalances in BOD, red tides, and algal blooms. The climate is warming rapidly due to the mass release of greenhouse gasses and we see it every single day in extreme weather all over the world. As the icecaps melt the salinity of the oceans is changing, weakening currents we rely on to distribute thermal energy throughout our atmosphere and oceans. 

The scientific community is drawing attention to all of this with conclusive solid results and data but all our political and economic leaders are focusing on is money and power. Entire swaths of the population are being convinced, despite what they see with their own eyes, that this is all a natural process and there's nothing to worry about. I suppose if you count human intervention as natural you could say that. Believing that unchecked pollution is bad is somehow now a political stance. 

Humanity is so focused on unlimited economic growth and possessions that we are running ourselves right off of a cliff. Capitalist societies are driving authoritarian countries to do most of the damage but they are just as culpable if not more. We have the technology, resources, and knowledge to fix these problems but because it if not profitable most would rather just destroy the earth (or at least our capacity to live on it). Politicians are bought and paid for by the people making money off of the destruction of our planets human friendly ecosystem, and there seems to be no end in sight. ",08 May 2024 14:16:06,reddit

Unlike their smaller  counterparts, giant viruses boast genomes and physical sizes comparable  to that of some bacterial cells, blurring the lines between viral and  cellular life forms. Among these microbial giants, a particular virus  infecting the amoeboflagellate \*Naegleria\* has drawn significant  attention, not least because of its host's infamous relative, \*Naegleria  fowleri\*‚Äîthe brain-eating amoeba responsible for fatal encephalitis in  humans.

The Intriguing World of Giant Viruses

Link: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47308-2#Abs1](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47308-2#Abs1)

Giant  viruses, belonging to the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, are distinguished  by their large double-stranded DNA genomes, which encode a vast array of  proteins, including those involved in translation‚Äîa feature previously  thought to be exclusive to cellular organisms. This extensive genetic  repertoire allows giant viruses to exert considerable control over their  host cells, manipulating them in ways that are only beginning to be  understood. The recent isolation of a novel giant virus, \*Catovirus  naegleriensis\* (Naegleriavirus, NiV), from an amoeboflagellate host,  provides a unique opportunity to study these interactions in detail.  This virus not only infects various \*Naegleria\* species but also  demonstrates a remarkable capacity to lyse them, including the  pathogenic \*N. fowleri\*.

Giant Viruses and \*Naegleria\*: A Complex Relationship

Link: [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300904#s0010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682218300904#s0010)

The  interaction between giant viruses and \*Naegleria\* species is a vivid  illustration of the complexity of microbial ecosystems. The capability  of \*Naegleriavirus\* to infect and kill \*N. fowleri\* suggests potential  applications in controlling the spread of this pathogen in warm  freshwater environments, where outbreaks of the deadly brain infection  occur. Moreover, the study of this virus-host dynamic offers insights  into the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis and host resistance, shedding  light on the broader implications of giant viruses in microbial ecology  and evolution.

Parasitism and Ecosystem Dynamics

Giant  viruses introduce an additional layer of predation within microbial  communities, acting as ""hyperparasites"" that infect and lyse amoebae,  which are themselves predators of bacteria. This parasitic relationship  can significantly impact microbial population dynamics and nutrient  cycling in aquatic ecosystems. For instance, the lysis of algal blooms  by giant viruses can lead to sudden shifts in the composition of  microbial communities, affecting the entire food web.

Implications for Human Health

While  direct infections by giant viruses in humans have not been documented,  their interactions with amoebae like \*N. fowleri\* have indirect  implications for human health. The ability of giant viruses to infect  and potentially modulate the virulence of amoebae raises concerns about  their role in the emergence and spread of amoebic diseases. Furthermore,  the study of giant viruses may uncover novel molecular mechanisms of  pathogenesis and immunity, offering new targets for therapeutic  intervention.

Challenges and Future Directions

The  study of giant viruses is fraught with challenges, from the isolation  and cultivation of new viruses to the characterization of their complex  interactions with host cells. The interdisciplinary efforts of  virologists, microbiologists, ecologists, and bioinformaticians are  crucial to unravel the mysteries surrounding these enigmatic entities.  As we delve deeper into the biology of giant viruses, we are likely to  discover new paradigms in virology and microbial ecology, with  far-reaching implications for our understanding of life on Earth.

In  conclusion, the discovery of \*Naegleriavirus\* and its interaction with  \*Naegleria\* species opens a new chapter in the study of giant viruses,  offering a window into the intricate web of microbial life. The  implications of these findings stretch far beyond the confines of  microbiology, touching upon fundamental questions about the nature of  viruses, the evolution of life, and the delicate balance of ecosystems.  As we continue to explore this uncharted territory, we may find new ways  to combat microbial pathogens and protect human health, underscoring  the importance of basic scientific research in addressing real-world  challenges.",25 Apr 2024 11:40:38,reddit

***


On some level, I knew that I was on a wild trip. That part of me tried to ignore what my senses told me; attempted to beat my mind into submission and force my senses to observe what I knew was there. And yet, a more significant part of me believed my senses without reservation. I wanted to believe that what I saw was real because, honestly, the lie was more comforting than the truth. I desperately hoped that everything I had just been through, dealt with, and recovered from was a dream.

The human mind is a powerful thing: If you believe something hard enough, your mind makes it true‚Äîor as genuine a facsimile as possible. Take on too much stress, and you can get sick from it. Convince yourself that your medicine works, and it just might. Delude yourself into believing something, and you‚Äôll find every reason to keep believing the delusion, even when confronted with every piece of evidence to the contrary.

At its core, that‚Äôs all magic really is. Mind over matter. But instead of the matter being you, it‚Äôs the world.

Once we were whittled down to a handful of people, humans were forced to constantly challenge their preconceptions. All the people who clung to their biases rather than embrace cold, hard facts had perished. Conduits were meant to help with that; we gain insight into people as we connect to the collective unconscious. For a lot of Conduits it's all about about striving to rise above self-delusion and ignorance, which I think is a noble sentiment.

It‚Äôs a damn shame that my bane makes it that much easier for my senses to betray me.

‚ÄúGet her shoulders; don‚Äôt grab her arms‚Äî‚Äú

Shapes danced in the terror-soaked twilight behind my eyelids. I opened them, and the amber lamplight on the ceiling burned down like miniature suns, making my eyes water. I saw cables, braided wires, and hastily connected woven hoses with brass couplings. I smelled lubricant mixed with rich earth and felt a subtle humidity on my skin, masked by a gentle artificial wind.

I was Home.

‚Äú‚ÄîTurn that damn thing off! Shut it down, and start finding‚Äî‚Äú

I couldn‚Äôt pick up my neck; someone was steadying it and holding it tight. I was being moved *somewhere*. My eyes focused on the connection from the hose attached to the chrysalis, and as we moved, I dimly traced the connection back. I didn‚Äôt know whether I was thinking it in my mind or I was muttering it: *hose to the aetheric bellows, bellows to the primary camshaft, to the electric motor stack, to the bioelectric transformer, to the biocell array*. I saw the rows of containers with their soft blue-green light and felt the effort it took my mind to attach a label to it: *starbloom biocell*.

*Bioelectric battery that generates electricity using algal blooms of *Astethra Syncrova*. Discovered in a cave network below the Warren, shaped by Alvi Verdomancers to increase metabolism, electrical output, and luminescence. A Human-Tevelish engineering crew that traces their patent lineage back to the late Geferan reformation guilds built the metal and ceramic housing and the alchemical brass couplings to integrate with Fanein electric motors‚Äî*

‚Äú‚ÄîRecovery couch is right here, get her‚Äî‚Äú

The blue-green light from the cells reflected off the brass in the room like a treasure hoard, but my mind couldn‚Äôt keep hold of a coherent visual. The reflected light started to bleed into the color of the surfaces like watercolors in a rainstorm, the saturation running down to pool on the ground. The sound of dripping water pounded in my ears, first soft, then unimaginably loud. Truth and illusion flowed between each other without form or reason. The ship‚Äôs metal bulkheads merged with the stone walls of the testing chamber like the curling patterns of Heshae‚Äôs bark-like crest, like the flames in Taga‚Äôs eyes.

A steady stream of information poured out of me as my eyes attempted to focus on my surroundings. Things would be as expected one moment before crashing into a kaleidoscope of stained-glass colors like the membranes of Selema-vass‚Äô wings. My psyche hid in the deep recesses of my mind, beyond the outpour of data, asking whether or not I was losing my mind.

‚Äú‚ÄîHeart rate is elevated, get the emergency trolley‚Äî‚Äú

My body was discarded onto the recovery couch, and the synthetic gossfluff and cultured leather felt *amazing*. The world shifted from where I wanted to be to where I thought I was: one second, I‚Äôd see the bellows, the machine parts, all the combined effort of the Sidereal Pact to get this one ancient machine running, and the next, I‚Äôd see the wild, strange mechanical guts of the ship above me as I lay on a grated floor.

Then the railings grew into tree branches and sprouted leaves of luminescent twilight, which drifted to the ground. The leaves evaporated, and I found myself back on the recovery couch in the Warren as they desperately tried to stabilize me.

My eyes drifted to a tall, thin shadow in the near distance: my mother‚Äôs figure standing on the stone rise nearby, observing the proceedings with that all-too-common mask of calculating neutrality on her face. An orderly, a boy of perhaps fourteen, jogged up to her and relinquished a clipboard. Papers flipped over the top of it every few seconds as she scanned their contents like a computational machine. She gave him a handful of clipped words and sent him off after jotting several figures on the papers.

A schoolmaster grading papers. A general to her troops. All hail the queen bee.

‚ÄúLady Volaire! The engineers are asking for you in the aether reservoir‚Ä¶‚Äù

My concentration was broken by the sharp and pungent smell of ammonia and the feeling of someone pouring cold water into the back of my head, like someone delving into my surface thoughts. I instinctively gasped for air, felt the cobwebs dissipate, and watched as the room shifted from the testing chamber to a cramped, dank space on the ship.

Selema-vass was walking away from me, cradling a circular device in her hands that cast an eerie amber glow as she fiddled with it. The amber light transformed into spiraling embers into the air like campfire flame, leaving afterimages in their wake. As each little ember touched a surface, it burned a hole into the paper skin of the world, showing the blurry but enduring image of the testing chamber behind it.

Light flowed out between the holes and widened into a brush stroke that painted the testing chamber in impressionistic blobs of color. It was the day they brought in the chrysalis; when we started working out how to connect to it and make it work. Technicians, engineers, and magi of every species in the pact worked towards activating it.

It was my mother‚Äôs‚ÄîLady Meralin Volaire‚Äôs plan. Unlock the secrets of this ancient magitech stasis chamber and make more of them; use them to wait out the re-greening of our world. The Tevelish and the Fane would join us in slumber, and the Alvi would become the stewards of our world, waiting a hundred or a thousand or ten thousand years for the day that we could re-emerge. The Pact would live on: not just for the Humans to whom Terra was their birthright, but all her children, old or new.

And then we would rebuild.

Behind the waves of sensory overload, I felt my body moving again. My mother was pulling me away from Feneska‚Äôs cloister, where I had been training to become a Conduit. The day‚Äôs training had been brutal; I could still feel dried blood down one nostril and the shadows of throbbing pain in my backside. Even then, I fought with every bit of strength I had left to stay in that room. She continued marching me out, calmly and cooly, telling me what I would do.

I interlaced my right hand with my left while it was still in her grasp and strained against her pull. I told her that I was doing this no matter what. That she couldn‚Äôt stop me. That she *wouldn‚Äôt* stop me. She ignored me. Heat flooded my body as I realized that I wasn‚Äôt going to let her decide for me, and I drove my foot into the back of her knee. She buckled like a collapsing building, pulling me down with her.

The tumble sent me sprawling, and the world tumbled with me. I came to rest against the far wall in a circular room with an array of doors on the far side of it. Low amber light bars ringed the floor, trailing up the walls and weaving between one another on the ceiling overhead, but then the room‚Äôs composition would shift and show me the vaulted ceiling of the cave that formed the mage‚Äôs cloister in the Warren. It was like watching two scenes superimposed on one another. Focus one eye, see the past. Focus on the other, see the present.

Then Taga was there, standing over me like a mother gorilla protecting her infant. He changed to Feneska, the shadow of her imposing form cloaking me in impenetrable night, but I could still feel Taga‚Äôs warmth against my skin. 

In all of the hallucinations that I had been subjected to after training, I had never felt something like this. It felt like reality was attempting to re-establish dominance over the illusion. It wasn‚Äôt me that was superimposing reality on the illusion: someone or something else was doing it.

‚ÄúYAMOU would refuse JU daughter AVOR birthright?‚Äù she and Taga said in a strange unison of their phrases. I shook my head to clear it and felt my temples throb. Whatever Selema-vass had done might be clearing up, but it wasn‚Äôt clear.

‚ÄúI would see her safe,‚Äù my mother‚Äîno, the Lady Volaire said. There was no emotion, no inflection in her voice. She was always like that. The statement would have had more emotion if my mother had written and mailed it to her. Selema-vass spoke, and the illusion expanded from her voice, swallowing me again.

‚ÄúSafe? How can she stay safe,‚Äù Feneska said, ‚Äúif she can‚Äôt defend herself.‚Äù Feneska tapped my mother‚Äôs cheek with the metal tip of her cane, pointing out her defenseless position. She‚Äôd done the same to me earlier that day when I was on the floor. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs no longer your decision. The council sided with me because we need new Conduits. We need new storytellers at the campfire, explaining the world. She belongs to the Gossamer now, Volaire.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe belongs with me. I give myself for the species daily; give me my daughter.‚Äù

‚ÄúFouza e‚Äôah, e riga du keecha?‚Äù Selema-vass said as she backed across the threshold of one of the circular doors just as I saw my mother‚Äôs ghost walk through the cloister threshold and out of sight. The phrases overlapped again, but what I saw felt real. My head wasn‚Äôt swimming anymore, and I felt my senses sharpen.

‚ÄúNA FOUZA JU A,‚Äù Taga said, inching forward and placing a protective arm around me. His bulk was imposing, but I could see and touch it. I knew it was real. For the first time, I *hoped* it was real, and I felt my heart skip a beat when I started exploring the implications of that statement.

And just like my mother, Selema-vass turned and limped into the escape pod, closing the hatch behind her. A few seconds later, a set of dull explosions popped off behind the door, and I saw nothing but the endless black curtain of space and gauzy multicolored clouds studded with the light of a million unfamiliar stars.

It was beautiful. Dangerous, but beautiful.


***


Taga and I returned to meet with the other groups that had spread out to search the ship for Selema-vass and me. During the walk back, I spent the last of the stored anima in my engram and got the abridged tale of what actually happened while I was off my nut.

She hadn‚Äôt been very circumspect while she worked to get a completely unresponsive me out of my infirmary room and back into the access corridor that she used to bypass everyone else, so the jig was up almost immediately. Taga had been halfway across the ship. If he hadn‚Äôt, the door would have been opened in seconds; as it was, it took a few engineers some time to get at the motivators and open it manually, and by that time, we were long gone.

Selema-vass had carried and dragged me halfway across the ship, through access corridors and hidden back entrances, through ventilation shafts and maintenance tunnels while I tripped my ass off and babbled like an idiot. After describing it, I asked Taga whether he could identify Selema-vass‚Äôs device, and he told me it was for communication.

You know the drill: tons of questions, not enough answers. If I was going to be stuck here, I needed to find a library.

Anyone who could stand and fight had broken off into groups and started combing the ship for her, driving her away from the escape pods and into the newly reopened starboard habitation. She managed to slip past the dragnet and make it to the starboard escape pods, where I finally came to my senses. In a startling coincidence, the kick I had leveled at my mother‚Äôs hallucination had dislocated her knee and broke her hold on me‚Äîhurrah for small miracles.

Paramount on my mind was answering how I had come to my senses in the first place. I didn‚Äôt do it, and after Taga told me it had been roughly twenty minutes since the whole debacle began (given the conversion between our time scales), I knew there was some exterior force at work. I would expect to be out for at least an hour with a blast like that. The weirdest thing was that I didn‚Äôt think she knew she was doing it.

Either that or she was a terrific liar.

Some parts of what she said didn‚Äôt quite add up. I had observed Ulketh speaking to Selema-vass through some sort of communication device on his upper torso during our initial push into engineering, and it sounded like she was a superior, not a subordinate.

Then, there were the things that she said that made sense. Keeping Ulketh from killing everyone made sense, but it also made sense that she was doing it to protect someone‚Äôs investment. I was more surprised that Ulketh was into killing everyone; it headlined the top of my ‚Äúreally dumb ideas‚Äù list. And then what had she said about the last six weeks? How had she been researching me, the chrysalis, and the artifacts they recovered?

‚ÄúTaga, I‚Äôm going to the cargo hold.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt see if he would follow me; I didn‚Äôt care. What mattered to me was the other things in those crates. I remembered my unceremonious deposit onto the cargo hold floor and what I had seen there. At first glance, I had identified it as treasure, but what if it wasn‚Äôt?

My brain replayed my memories from earlier as I ran. The doors to the cargo hold were still jammed open‚Äîthanks, Taga‚Äîand the room had been returned to some semblance of order, except for a few panels ripped off the wall on the port side. Those panels matched up with the ones used to build the shield for the distraction a few hours back, so I doubted they would be making a return trip.

And there it was, the chrysalis. I looked at it for a long while, standing almost in the same spot my mom would have been standing in. Blessing, or curse? My pulse quickened, and I let my mind drift in and out of memory for a while. It wasn‚Äôt why I was here, though. I had other business.

It took a few seconds to figure out how it worked, but I opened the end of the cargo container that held all the ‚Äútreasure‚Äù from before. A jumble of Pact-era technology spilled out and around my feet, with more of it deeper in. Larger shadows in the back hinted at objects I hallucinated earlier: empty biocells, hoses, transformers, mechanical devices, valves, and a thousand different parts for a thousand different machines.

Icy calm crept into my voice as I said, ‚ÄúTaga, where did you get all this?‚Äù

It took him a moment to answer, and when he did, his words came out slow and deliberate, ‚ÄúDO NOT KNOW. SOMEONE FAMILIAR WITH MASTER TOKUL‚ÄôS OPERATION. HESHAE SAID THIS, YES? WE TOLD HER T‚Äî‚Äù

*Holy shit.* I was off like lightning, rushing back to the infirmary. I asked everyone where Heshae was until I got a straight answer that she was at the helm, coordinating efforts to leave. Taga caught up with me in the makeshift armory and bolted with me to the helm, where several people had strapped into the control couches and were busy making final adjustments for travel.

The helm looked a lot like the command and control vault in the Warden. Most seats were in a half-circle formation on a depressed platform, surrounding a singular elevated chair in the center. Instead of paper on pantelegraphs and brass dials, those same black glass panels were everywhere. While I couldn‚Äôt tell you what was on them, there was something there; technicians glanced at them and rattled off information as fast as they could speak.

‚ÄúHello again, Amelin,‚Äù Heshae said from behind my left shoulder, making me twitch, ‚ÄúI heard that Taga had found you and was busy aiding you with something. We are about to get underway; did you need my help?‚Äù

I assumed an air of dignified calm‚Äîor hoped I did‚Äîand sat next to her. At a gesture from Messec, Taga‚Äôs hands gripped a pair of massive handholds on either side of the foyer just inside the door, which slid shut and clicked to lock.

‚ÄúThe Impellers are going, and the aetherflow is almost to maximum,‚Äù a creature of the same species as Veligrusk said while turning to Messec in the primary seat, ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre ready to try this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, let‚Äôs spread the word,‚Äù Messec said, touching another one of those black panels next to him. ‚ÄúEveryone, we‚Äôre about to try and get out of here. Strap in for the transit, you know the drill.‚Äù

It made sense as soon as I heard the dull echo of his voice from the hallway. *Shipboard radio. Gotcha.* I might have been out of touch with the technology, but some things were similar enough for me to understand. While they continued checking and making a show of sounding off their respective stations, I buckled myself in and whispered, ‚ÄúBefore Selema-vass took me on a tour of the ship‚Äôs bowels, she said that she had spent the last six weeks researching where all of the Pact gear in the hold came from. Most of what she said was bullshit, but that wasn‚Äôt, was it?‚Äù

Heshae turned to me with a face colored with regret and began to open her mouth before I cut her off.

‚ÄúSo she was telling the truth about that,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúShe said that I was ‚Äòrecovered.‚Äô From whom or what? From where? What else *aren‚Äôt* you telling me?‚Äù

‚ÄúAmelin, it was a delicate, time-sensitive situation. I didn‚Äôt have the time to explain everything that I knew, and‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you do now. I *gave* you the time. So talk.‚Äù

The air grew still between us, and contrary to what I wanted to do (which was to force her to spill it *immediately*), I let her gather her thoughts. As she opened her mouth to speak, a voice from within the ship interrupted her. 

In a deep resonant tone full of forgotten sorrow, the ship said, ‚ÄúPrepare for Waycast.‚Äù

That old, familiar elastic sensation washed over me, and pins and needles danced across my skin simultaneously. If I wasn‚Äôt strapped in to a chair on a ship going somewhere using the conceptual space between the material world and the Gossamer, you could have knocked me over with a feather. You could have knocked me over with a hair. With a look.

I found my voice about a million years later, and blurted out, ‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù",16 Apr 2024 10:39:50,reddit

But I have never seen this with an aquatic theme. Plagues and insects coming from the deep sea. I imagine someone like that could perhaps summon bobbit worms from the ground, conjure magical jellyfish that spread some sort of poisonous algal bloom, use parasites that would normally attack fish now attack humans, leeches, etc.

Do you guys have any more ideas for this kind of plague magic? Specific spells or general directions, all are welcome!

Edit: The magic doesn't necessarily need to affect bodies of water or fish, I just wanna swap the thematics around. So imagine a regular plague mage but with an aquatic flair to them.

343,https://youtu.be/uTmkohs2PvI?si=shY7IJdYR7ETH0zg,Massive project works to restore Florida's Everglades,"The Everglades; the massive restoration project underway in north America, which is considered the largest environmental restoration effort in the world, with billions of dollars being invested to restore millions of acres of the unique ecosystem.

The purpose of this environmental restoration is to undo the damage caused by human activities such as farming, road projects, and land development. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aims to restore the natural flow of the Everglades, improve water quality, and protect the ecosystem's wildlife and plant life. It is also intended to provide for other water-related needs of the region, including water supply and flood protection. The project is expected to take 30 years to complete and cost $US7.8 billion, making it the largest hydrologic restoration project ever undertaken in the USA.

The benefits of the Everglades restoration project are numerous and significant. Here are some of those:

üíß Improved water quality: üå± The project will improve water quality by reducing nutrient pollution and harmful algal blooms.

üåø Enhanced wildlife habitat: üêæ Restoring the natural flow of the Everglades will enhance habitat for fish and wildlife, including endangered species like the Florida panther and manatee.

üåä Flood protection: üè† The project will improve flood protection for communities in South Florida.

üí∞ Economic benefits: üíº The restoration project is expected to create jobs and boost the regional economy.

üí¶ Increased water supply: üö∞ The project will increase the water supply for South Florida's growing population.

üåç Climate change adaptation: üå°Ô∏è Restoring the Everglades will help the region adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and more frequent extreme weather events.

It's wonderful new this amazing efforts underway to protect and restore the Everglades, one of the most unique and valuable ecosystems in the world. It's a great reminder of the importance of environmental conservation and stewardship.

The United States has [extracted more oil for each of the last 6 years](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/28/oil-and-gas-fossil-fuels-report) than any country in history. Another [conference on global heat](https://www.usaid.gov/heatactionhub) began on 28 March, and will run through early June, accomplishing little. And, although temperatures are rapidly rising, [the **heat index is rising even faster**](https://www.dailycal.org/news/campus/research-and-ideas/campus-study-finds-heat-index-rising-faster-than-global-temperatures/article_4e7785d8-ec22-11ee-9130-6790a19554c8.html). A [study](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adl1598) in *Science Advances* concluded that **heat waves are lasting longer, and traveling more slowly**, because of manmade climate change.

A state of emergency was [declared in part of eastern Malaysia](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3256725/malaysias-drought-hit-sabah-taps-run-dry-more-extreme-heat-expected) over worsening Drought. [**Flooding in Brazil**](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/25/climate/brazil-flooding-landslide-climate-intl/index.html) killed at least 27, displacing 7,000+. At least 15 Mexican states [are experiencing wildfires](https://www.sfgate.com/news/world/article/forest-fires-burn-in-nearly-half-of-mexico-s-19368488.php), made worse by a lasting Drought. Flooding [slew 7+](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/least-seven-dead-nairobi-flooding-120203712.html) in Nairobi. 

The EU Parliament [shelved a plan](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/a-major-european-climate-change-plan-stumbles-amid-farmer-protests) to restore tracts of land & sea, in advance of a vote that was certain to fail. With new EU elections in June [expected](https://europeelects.eu/ep2024/) to boost conservatives and reduce the number of seats of greens & socialists, future environmental legislation will be less likely to pass. 

Drought is [interfering with crawfish spawning](https://thefishsite.com/articles/how-drought-is-destroying-the-us-crawfish-sector-in-louisiana) patterns in the U.S. Deep South. **Low water levels** threaten to leave fragile eggs exposed, and reduce the amount of vegetation (and oxygen) necessary to support baby crawfish. 

Dunes in South Australia are [being pushed inland](https://theconversation.com/coastal-dunes-are-retreating-as-sea-levels-rise-our-research-reveals-the-accelerating-rate-of-change-225664) over 3 meters per year, as a result of rising sea levels, Drought, and winds. Meanwhile, [Sahara duststorms](https://archive.ph/nikxo) are reaching Europe more often, thanks to changing weather patterns and growing **desertification**. The Greater Beijing area was also [smacked with a **duststorm**](https://www.mk.co.kr/en/world/10977974), forcing some schools and factories to temporarily close. Duststorms may also [carry bacteria & fungi](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-unseen-storms-bacteria-fungi-world.html) over great distances.

The Maldives [hit 35 ¬∞C](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1771874567503368214) 95 ¬∞F for the first time in March. A heat wave in Thailand [is expected](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1773354872462569886) to hit 43 ¬∞C (109 ¬∞F), with a [temperature humidity index](https://www.britannica.com/science/temperature-humidity-index) of 55 ¬∞C in Bangkok, and nights over 30 ¬∞C. [Wet-bulb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature) here we come. Phuket already [broke its all-time temperature](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1773327437289447879) with 39.3 ¬∞C (103 ¬∞F). Meanwhile, Guatemala [made new records](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1773033316112851305) for March, and, in some regions, all-time temps; Honduras, too. Guyana [broke its March temperature record](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1772743698410836466), and parts of Algeria‚Äôs highlands [hit such high temperatures](https://twitter.com/extremetemps/status/1771887481551503781) that they not only broke March records, but April & May records, too.

**Cyclone Gamane** [lashed Madagascar](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/29/weather-tracker-cyclone-gamane-unexpectedly-veers-into-madagascar), killing at least [18 people](https://www.arise.tv/at-least-18-dead-thousands-displaced-as-tropical-cyclone-causes-devastation-in-madagascar/) and destroying hundreds of houses. The Atlantic hurricane season is [shaping up](https://www.accuweather.com/en/hurricane/explosive-atlantic-hurricane-season-predicted-for-2024-accuweather-experts-warn/1633944) to be a record season with ‚Äú**well above the historical average number of tropical storms, hurricanes, major hurricanes and direct U.S. impacts**,‚Äù according to one meteorologist. Scientists expect more named storms, more serious hurricanes, and more U.S. storm impacts than average. Hurricane season for the U.S. begins on June 1.

Iowa, America‚Äôs #1 corn state, is [facing Drought](https://ukragroconsult.com/en/news/the-largest-corn-state-in-the-united-states-is-suffering-from-drought-on-the-eve-of-planting-season/) and water restrictions just as the planting season approaches. Yet global corn supplies have swollen so much that [corn prices are expected to drop](https://www.agriculture.com/u-s-crop-prices-head-downhill-after-roller-coaster-climb-8426669) considerably later this year. Conversely, Irish potato-planting is [being hampered by overly wet earth](https://www.potatonewstoday.com/2024/03/28/potato-planting-in-peril-irish-farmers-face-uncertain-future-amidst-wet-weather-woes/) forcing a delay to the planting. Blistering Drought in Iraq is [forcing some farmers](https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20240328-in-iraq-water-crisis-leaves-farmers-clinging-to-sidr-trees/) to plant drought-resistant jujube trees instead of classic date palms.

Atmospheric warming has caused [a polar vortex to reverse direction](https://www.space.com/earth-polar-vortex-spinning-backwards-above-arctic-reversal-event)‚Äîthough it is believed to soon return to its normal course. Renowned climate scientist James Hansen released a 14-page [article](https://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/2024/Hopium.MarchEmail.2024.03.29.pdf) claiming that **global warming is accelerating**, contrary to the claims made by the IPCC‚Äôs global climate models.

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46577-1) in *Nature Communications claims that reforestation can, in some instances, actually lead to a warmer climate, when one factors in the **albedo** (sunlight reflection) change. Savannahs which were reforested may absorb more sunlight; this effect is not accounted for in many studies, leading to **overestimations of the impact of carbon sequestration** for some projects. [Another study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-024-01313-x) on Australian efforts to reforest tracts of land determined that their efforts had a negligible effect on carbon offsets.

Antarctica‚Äôs largest ice shelves are moving a few inches every day, according to [a study](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL108040) released last week. Glaciers are ‚Äúslipping‚Äù on icy rivers partially as a result of [lamb waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_waves). Meanwhile, scientists looking into eutrophication in the Baltic Sea are concerned with how [blue-green **algal blooms** may endanger sea life](https://phys.org/news/2024-03-eutrophication-climate-food-webs-baltic.html) and impact the global food chain‚Äîand how such problems may not be limited to just the Baltic Sea.

A Colorado university released a 48-page [report](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63ffa3d6d5088335a4306e8a/t/65e1ce15281d0f13f001fb97/1709297187964/Decarbonizing_Water_report_March2024_FINAL-WEB.pdf) on carbon credits and **water security** claims that the market for voluntary carbon credits may incentivize local sustainable water projects‚Ä¶or something. I couldn‚Äôt fully understand this report but some of you might find it interesting.

Climate change is [impacting our brains](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/everybody-has-a-breaking-point-how-the-climate-crisis-affects-our-brains) and leading to greater **ADHD, Alzheimer‚Äôs, depression**, and much more. Rising CO2 levels have been linked to decreased **concentration abilities, domestic violence, and aggression**. Storms and wildfires can give survivors PTSD. And don‚Äôt even get me [started on health threats from nano/microplastics](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/06/health/nanoplastics-heart-attack-study-wellness/index.html). Chemical pollution from fossil fuels is also [contributing to **diabetes**, some **cancers**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/06/increase-fossil-fuel-pollution-health-risk-report), and neurological problems. 

**Dengue fever has** [**come to Puerto Rico**](https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/28/health/dengue-fever-puerto-rico-emergency/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc), with 500+ new cases this year.

Debt [feeds the exploitation](https://archive.ph/5MBd8) of sugar workers in India, forcing girls into early marriages. For these desperate wage slaves, many of whom are pushed into hysterectomies, Collapse has already arrived. 

Crops around the world are [losing some of their nutrients](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/28/vegetables-losing-nutrients-biofortification) due to rising CO2 levels. In response, scientists are looking into ‚Äú**biofortification**,‚Äù a process which engineers seeds to produce one or two nutrients in greater quantities; botanists are not yet able to increase all nutrients for a given seed. 

[20% of food is wasted](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/mar/27/fifth-of-food-wasted-globally-at-cost-of-1tn-a-year-says-un-report), according to a 191-page UN Report, the [**Food Waste Index**](https://wedocs.unep.org/handle/20.500.11822/45230) 2024. Although fewer than half of the world‚Äôs nations have data on household food waste (and fewer than 25% have data on food service & retail food waste), the report indicates that ‚Äúthe median amount of food waste is 212 grams per person per day or 77 kilograms per person per year, close to the global average of 81 kilograms in this report.‚Äù According to the report, food waste is primarily an urban issue, and is concentrated more among households than in the restaurant industry or retail‚Äîwhich doesn‚Äôt seem to me to be entirely accurate. The report also lacks data on agricultural food waste, like crops rotting in the field.

>‚ÄúFood waste‚Ä¶results in the throwing away of more than US$1 trillion worth of food every year. It is also an environmental failure: **food waste generates an estimated 8‚Äì10 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions** (including from both loss and waste), and it takes up the equivalent of nearly 30 per cent of the world‚Äôs agricultural land.‚Ä¶up to 783 million people are affected by hunger each year‚Ä¶.Most G20 countries do not have data suitable for tracking progress‚Ä¶.‚Äù -selections from the executive summary

The Agricultural Revolution marked a pivotal moment in human history, transforming societies from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agricultural communities. While it brought about significant advancements in food production and human civilization, it also initiated profound changes in the Earth's carbon cycle, impacting our environment in ways that continue to resonate today. This essay explores the intricate relationship between the Agricultural Revolution and carbon, delving into its environmental impacts and avenues for sustainable practices.

The Agricultural Revolution and Carbon Dynamics:

The transition from foraging to farming during the Agricultural Revolution led to the widespread clearing of forests and conversion of land for agriculture. This land-use change resulted in the release of large amounts of carbon stored in trees and soil organic matter into the atmosphere. Deforestation, a prominent consequence of agricultural expansion, not only reduced carbon sinks but also increased carbon emissions due to the decomposition of cleared vegetation.

Furthermore, the adoption of agricultural practices such as slash-and-burn farming and intensive monoculture cultivation exacerbated carbon emissions. These practices often led to soil degradation, loss of soil organic carbon, and increased vulnerability to erosion. Additionally, the use of fossil fuels for mechanized agriculture and transportation further contributed to carbon emissions, exacerbating the greenhouse effect and global climate change.

Environmental Impacts:

The Agricultural Revolution's carbon footprint extends beyond emissions to encompass broader environmental impacts. Deforestation for agricultural purposes not only releases carbon but also diminishes biodiversity, disrupts ecosystems, and compromises ecosystem services such as water regulation and soil fertility. Moreover, the reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides in modern agriculture contributes to nitrogen pollution, further exacerbating environmental degradation.

The intensification of agriculture has also led to water scarcity, soil erosion, and loss of arable land, creating challenges for sustainable food production. Furthermore, agricultural runoff containing fertilizers and pesticides pollutes water bodies, resulting in eutrophication and harmful algal blooms, further compromising aquatic ecosystems and human health.

Sustainable Solutions:

Addressing the environmental challenges posed by the Agricultural Revolution requires a multifaceted approach that prioritizes sustainability and resilience. Adopting agroecological practices such as

&#x200B;

 conservation agriculture, agroforestry, and integrated pest management can enhance soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration while reducing reliance on synthetic inputs.

Furthermore, promoting sustainable land-use practices such as reforestation, afforestation, and land restoration can help mitigate carbon emissions and restore ecosystem services. Investing in renewable energy sources, promoting energy efficiency, and transitioning towards regenerative agricultural systems can reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture and foster climate resilience.

Moreover, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations between scientists, policymakers, farmers, and communities is essential for implementing evidence-based solutions and fostering agricultural sustainability. Empowering smallholder farmers through access to resources, knowledge, and markets can enhance food security, livelihoods, and resilience to climate change while promoting environmental stewardship.

Conclusion:

The Agricultural Revolution has profoundly influenced the Earth's carbon cycle, shaping landscapes, ecosystems, and climate dynamics. While it has contributed to significant advancements in food production and human development, it has also precipitated environmental challenges that necessitate urgent action. By embracing sustainable agricultural practices, promoting ecosystem restoration, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations, we can mitigate the environmental impacts of the Agricultural Revolution and pave the way towards a more resilient and sustainable future.",27 Mar 2024 09:46:13,reddit

Originally the lagoon was an teeming reef. This atoll located 100km away from mainland Kairul, and it is inside Kairulan's interior sea, far enough to make it immune to the asteroid impact which concluded the First Dynasty, but also close enough to make an tropical climate and to all 6 groups of First Dynasty's terrestrial animals to raft or island-hopping to the atoll. After the Dynastic Extinction, the reefs perished and replaced by an seagrass meadow. Recent migrants to the lagoon is Lonchidion, an hybodontiform shark,  some pachycormids, icthyodectids, pycnodontid and coccolepid. In the atoll, various ambuloicthyian, torosteonian, heterotherm, fabadont, dignathian and carbosuchian thrived. It was during the last dynasty of the First Children that they attempt to conquer Kairul and banish their enslaved Kentarims onto the atoll, and also make an stone dam that culled the lagoon to outside, entirely isolate the lagoon. Now, the Kentarim have made an stable population on the atoll. The atoll was located in the center of the shallow seagrass meadows of the interior sea between Kairul's two peninsula, 100km away from mainland. Some amynodontid rhino from outside the atoll may come from the atoll coast to rest, or the Terror Dolphin(Squalodelphis/Squalodon kairulensis) that landfall in the atoll for 1-3 hours to pursue dignathians because the fabadonts and torosteonians is too rapid for an amphibious cetacean to drag it body to pursue, but instead, it use ambush or stealthy tactics to catch the fabadonts and torosteonians when on land, like what it do to the neotenic lambeosaurine on mainland ",26 Mar 2024 06:23:52,reddit

That of lightning and something solid landing very hard. Lon got quakes, but not lightning. It sounded controlled too, perhaps deliberate. Only one way to find out what it came from.

She grabbed a condensed mana canister, the visage orb, and her trusty osmium staff, prepared to leave. Her bare skeletal feet shuffled hesitantly over the dust outside her cave. Nothing had changed for thousands of years, and before the Great Wizard War of 2907, 4 million years. 

It was never something good, that was for certain. Yet something always had to be done about it.

Zastrus sighed. There was no point fighting it.

‚ÄúStay here, Ball! I usually bring you everywhere, but this might be too dangerous for you.‚Äù

The orb let out a gurgle.

Title: Enhancing Soil Health Through Organic Farming Practices

&#x200B;

Introduction:

Organic farming stands as a beacon of sustainable agriculture, prioritizing soil health and ecological balance over chemical-intensive practices. Central to this approach is the recognition that [healthy soil](https://kavyaorganicfarm.com/how-organic-farming-enrich-the-soil/)is the foundation of successful farming. By eschewing synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, organic farming methods focus on enhancing soil fertility, structure, and biodiversity. In this article, we delve into how organic farming enriches the soil, fostering a symbiotic relationship between agriculture and the environment.

&#x200B;

1. Building Soil Structure:

   Organic farming employs practices such as crop rotation, cover cropping, and minimal tillage to enhance soil structure. These techniques promote the formation of stable aggregates, which improve soil porosity, water infiltration, and root penetration. By reducing soil compaction and erosion, organic farmers mitigate the loss of valuable topsoil and preserve soil fertility for future generations.

&#x200B;

2. Nutrient Cycling:

   Organic farming emphasizes the recycling of nutrients within the farming system. Through composting, green manure, and crop residues, organic farmers return organic matter to the soil, enriching it with essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This closed-loop approach minimizes the need for external inputs, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and mitigating nutrient runoff into waterways, which can lead to harmful algal blooms and aquatic ecosystem degradation.

&#x200B;

3. Microbial Diversity:

   Soil is teeming with microbial life crucial for nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and plant health. Organic farming practices nurture this microbial diversity by providing habitat and organic matter for beneficial microorganisms. By avoiding synthetic pesticides and herbicides, organic farmers safeguard the delicate balance of soil microbiota, fostering a resilient soil ecosystem capable of supporting healthy plant growth and suppressing pathogens naturally.

&#x200B;

4. Carbon Sequestration:

   Organic farming has the potential to act as a powerful tool in the fight against climate change by sequestering carbon in the soil. Through practices such as agroforestry, perennial cropping systems, and conservation tillage, organic farmers enhance carbon storage in the form of soil organic matter. This not only mitigates greenhouse gas emissions but also improves soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability, contributing to the long-term resilience of agricultural systems in the face of climate variability.

&#x200B;

5. Biodiversity Conservation:

   Organic farming practices prioritize biodiversity both above and below ground. By promoting diverse crop rotations, intercropping, and hedgerows, organic farmers create habitat for a wide array of plant and animal species. This ecological diversity enhances pollination, pest control, and soil fertility, reducing the need for external inputs and fostering a more resilient and self-regulating agroecosystem.

&#x200B;

6. Reduced Environmental Impact:

   Unlike conventional farming, which relies heavily on synthetic inputs and often leads to environmental degradation, organic farming minimizes its ecological footprint. By avoiding synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, organic farmers protect water quality, preserve biodiversity, and mitigate soil erosion. Furthermore, organic farming promotes energy efficiency, conservation of natural resources, and resilience to climate change, making it a sustainable choice for the future of agriculture.

&#x200B;

Conclusion:

Organic farming offers a holistic approach to soil management, prioritizing soil health, biodiversity, and ecological sustainability. By adopting practices that enhance soil structure, nutrient cycling, microbial diversity, and carbon sequestration, organic farmers nurture resilient agroecosystems capable of sustaining food production while mitigating environmental impacts. As the challenges of climate change, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss loom large, organic farming stands as a beacon of hope, demonstrating that a regenerative approach to agriculture is not only possible but essential for the well-being of people and the planet.",22 Mar 2024 14:44:31,reddit

357,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/1bfmlrt/advice_for_upcoming_fish_auction/,Advice for upcoming fish auction,"Hello everyone.  I have a 120 gallon tropical freshwater community tank that is currently understocked.   PH around 7.  Temp around 80.  I have not stocked the tank in some time, in anticipation of a local fish auction, which is now here.

I have one gold severum as a showpiece fish.  
I have a blue acara.  
I have a raphael catfish and chinese algae eater  
I have a small school of black skirt tetras and giant danios.  
I have a small pleco and a few snails and a couple of Florida flag fish for algae purposes.

I prefer a tank that is balanced and requires little upkeep.  I try to find natural solutions and choose fish and plants that will do the work for me, when possible.

I have recently added some aquarium plants and in the past I haven't had much luck.  In doing so, I'm now dosing the tank and have increased the lighting conditions to encourage growth.  That, paired with not adding to my algae crew has resulted in some floor-algae, which is not something I normally have to deal with.

The auction format means that I can't 100% know what's going to be available ahead of time, so I have to have an open mind and be able to respond quickly.  I know I would like to replace cory catfish, as I currently have none.  I would also like to add non-plant-eating snails and more plants, themselves.  Other than that, what do you recommend to be on the lookout for that might do well with the fish I have, especially anything that will help naturally combat the algal bloom I'm experiencing on the floor of the tank.

Thanks!",15 Mar 2024 15:44:09,reddit

I will likely be a ‚Äòlifer‚Äô at the company I work at just due to the flexibility, freedom, and development opportunities afforded to me as a B.S. degree holder. To do what I do in my industry, typically specialty education (M.S. &/or P.hd) is necessary but I have wonderful coworkers, mentors, and supervisors who have given many hours to help educate me, partaken in many workshops and industry trainings, trained myself through self-study and research, and used networking connections to find myself in national and state level organizations that afford me access to a whole field of great minds to ask questions to.

As mentioned in the title, I‚Äôm in the process of developing a new department at my company and have a timeline of roughly a year to get it off the ground while also training someone to fill my current position. I expect this to come with a job title change and pay raise but that has not been fully fleshed out yet.

Yes, both my husband and I have Income Share Agreements‚Ä¶. I would NOT recommend this to ANYONE EVER. We were taken advantage of by the university we attended and were lied to about the funding source and purpose. Ended up being that our university partnered with a huge hedge fund to fund Income Share Agreements with false projected salaries to make future payment assumptions upon. In my husband‚Äôs case, we will pay less than he borrowed but for me, I will pay more than I borrowed. We are 4 years into our 10-year income share agreements. Unfortunately, not covered in any borrower‚Äôs defense and despite a lot of local media coverage there has been so collective action lawsuit or anything for us to take part in so we‚Äôre just kind of screwed. If we lose our jobs however the payment goes to $0 so there are a few measures in place that give us a little bit of protection.

**Wednesday:** Z wakes up before me to get ready to go into the office. He goes in about two times a month but it‚Äôs about 75 minutes from our house. I get up after a few additional snoozes on the alarm and get ready. He heads out and I scoop the litter boxes, play with the cats, make my coffee, fill my water bottle, and head out as well. I get to the office, boot up my computer, put together a task list for the day, and update some projects I‚Äôm working on. After a 90-minute marketing meeting, I take a phone call from someone who is driving up some pretty crucial samples to my laboratory from a farming operation in Illinois. They‚Äôll be here in about 2 hours. I grab my purse and head out into the nearest town to go purchase a dishwasher (company‚Äôs dime, not mine!) for the laboratory we are about 3 weeks from being completely done with building. I designed almost every aspect of this new laboratory, and even did the 3D proof of concept design drawing myself! I‚Äôm not sure how many people can say they‚Äôve had as much involvement in a project like this or have been on the receiving end of such an amazing investment for not only the company but for the operation and logistics of our laboratory.

While in town, I pick up a Subway sandwich and bring it back to the office to have for lunch. **$12.29.** While eating my lunch I see my local yoga/pilates studio I attend is partnering with a local independent bookstore for an event next week that will benefit the bookstore. They are trying to expand into a second location and are fundraising to make it happen. The class is a $25 donation that the studio will match. I sign up. **$25.** When the samples arrive, I start doing an algal ID while my lab tech starts on the water quality. I‚Äôm walking around boxes as we are partially trying to pack and partially trying to still keep necessary supplies accessible. We currently work in about 100 sqft of area‚Ä¶ Our 2000 sq ft space can not be finished fast enough.

I write up a report, do my time card for the past three days, and get the heck out of the office after summarizing some meeting notes into my project management software into some action items for further developing the new department I‚Äôm working on getting off the ground. I‚Äôll work more on this tomorrow if time allows. It‚Äôs grocery pick up day! Groceries end up being **$109.62** after some substitutions and unfulfilled items. I fill up the gas tank on the car for **$38.52**. The second car only gets filled up maybe once every other month depending on how much we‚Äôve got going on. I drop the groceries off at home and get started on dishes and dinner while Z attends the State of the City address by our mayor on his way home from work. Z is running for a county government position and we are very involved in local politics so we try to attend pretty much everything we can to keep up to date on the goings-ons, I just simply would not have made it to the meeting on time and could not stare at the sink being that full any longer.

Z gets home and we have Steak and asparagus. My attempt at zucchini fries is a horrendous and an absolutely gross mushy mess and does not get eaten. We watch New Girl (Season 4) and then I eventually fall asleep on the couch while Z plays video games until about 10pm when he wakes me up to go to bed. We put the house to bed and then ourselves to bed.

**Thursday:** Z and I wake up, shower, and get ready. I fill up my water bottle, make my coffee, and head out the door VERY sluggish this morning. No need to pack my lunch as we are having lunch catered by the dealership where we buy our work trucks. We placed a truck order this year in the $X,XXX,XXX number range and made some promotional videos that went semi-viral so a thank-you lunch is being provided. I make some edits to a document I‚Äôm supposed to have done before our research meeting right before the meeting‚Ä¶ and then sit through a 2-hour long meeting going over the year's research projects at all of our office locations. After that, some of us stayed to talk about a specific project call that is happening at noon to talk through specifics on the plan for management and monitoring this year as it is a VERY complicated water body with very complicated regulations. I‚Äôm not actually in the project call later, but I‚Äôll be looking at these samples so getting a gist on the project is always helpful.

Lunch is wonderful and I snag some brownies to bring home for Z and I. Our CEO is in the office and we spend a long time talking about the goings-on in the area and I update them on the political issues around town as they snowbird part of the year. After a very long lunch, I get back to work and start working on a presentation outline for a conference I‚Äôll be attending in 2 ¬Ω weeks that I should have started a lot sooner. I eventually hit a wall with this and ID some algae that came in during the morning of meetings.  After that, I check in on the task list I‚Äôve got for the department I‚Äôm working on developing. There‚Äôs a bit of laboratory research we are working on accomplishing so that we can determine the viability of this new operational department so I review an SOP we are working on updating and set up a game plan for the next time we will tackling the method again. I leave work at about 4:45 to get to town for a 5:30 yoga class before heading home. I purchased an unlimited class pass for $99/month. I typically attend somewhere between 15-25 classes a month and will do two classes on Saturday‚Äôs sometimes depending on whose teaching and what classes are in rotation! **I‚Äôd guess I pay about $7/class on average once you work in the very occasional late cancelation fee.**

I get home around 6:45 and head upstairs to Z‚Äôs office to hang out with him and the cats. We do some work getting his schedule together for campaign things, talk about the letter to the editor he‚Äôs writing, and chat about our weekend plans. By the time we realize what time it is, we realize we need to make dinner. We phone it in and have a freschetta frozen pizza and have some devils lettuce while it cooks. We catch up on some youtube, watch two more episodes of New Girl to finish Season 4, and then I read a library book before going to bed at 10pm. Z joins me around midnight after spending a lot of time thinking about the city‚Äôs poor transportation and working more on his letter to the editor.

**Friday:** I wake up feeling refreshed. I get ready, fill up my water bottle, and make my coffee and my lunch (Turkey & Pepperjack sandwich, fancy yogurt, granola bar, some cheese, & clementines). There‚Äôs only a tiny bit of turkey leftover after my sandwich so I split the turkey between our two cats. Both our cats have M names but two insanely different personalities. One is a grandpa in a 2-year-old cat body, the other is a [hellbender](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scientificamerican.com%2Farticle%2Fcannibalistic-dads-may-be-contributing-to-hellbender-salamander-declines%2F&psig=AOvVaw2G1vaoh0Dl85B0SIfIE23o&ust=1710429376477000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBMQjRxqFwoTCMC4_YzE8YQDFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE). I give the hellbender some first and then run over to the other cat and give him his half and then run back over to the hellbender and scatter some tiny pieces around him so it takes him longer to eat it to give grandpa a fair shot at eating his before hellbender can run over and steal his treats. Z helps me give Grandpa a fair chance by giving some encouraging pets.

Off to work and today I‚Äôm doing more lab work than I normally do as my lab tech is working from home so she could spend time with family and her twin sister. I try to be as fair and compassionate of a manager as humanly possible, especially since our ETO policy really sucks the first year of employment at just 40 hours of ETO. Before heading into the lab, I ask my mom if she wants to come up to a yoga class on Sunday with me if I buy brunch and she signs up for class. **$7**  I live about 90 minutes from my parents so we are always trying to find good excuses to get together. Then I use $30 in coupons I have for American Eagle to buy more of my favorite leggings that are on clearance. **$27.78** I hope they aren‚Äôt getting rid of this style as it is my favorite legging I‚Äôve had in YEARS. I work on some water quality, clean up the laboratory, and start packing some of our equipment into boxes that we won‚Äôt need in the next two weeks. We move into the new lab space in approximately 2 weeks! Speaking of which, I head over to the new lab and check on the progress so far. They have installed carpet in the office space and are installing cabinets in our dark room and bathrooms today! By lunchtime I‚Äôve got a ton of reports to generate, lots of phone calls to make, still need to email out some results, and work on my conference presentation some more. I call it quits around 2:45 and head home. I‚Äôm over 40 hours for the week and don‚Äôt have anything else that HAS to get done today.

On my way home, Z‚Äôs dad texts us about going to an open sensory gym this evening with Z‚Äôs niblings. I ask if Z‚Äôs dad will bring us some bikes (I‚Äôm hoping to learn how to ride a bike soon!) and that I‚Äôd see him there to help with keeping the kids in line. Z and I chat and talk about our weekend plans when I get home, but I‚Äôm not home for long before heading off to my 4:30 yoga class. After yoga I drive home to switch cars so I can better fit bikes in the back of the car and drive off to the open gym. Z stays home and starts on some spring cleaning tasks. We are only just now, over 5 years into our relationship really learning how to divide and conquer but we are honestly crushing it. It ends up just being my father in-law and I and two of the three niblings but we still have a lot of fun! My father in-law loses in glasses in a ball pit at some point so the next time I‚Äôm in it with my neice, I hunt them down for him. I teach my two-year-old niece how to use a water fountain, and I think it‚Äôs her favorite thing at the whole gymnasium. It‚Äôs raining really bad when they close the gym, so we drop off the kids at their house and say goodnight then meet back at my house where my father in law backs his car up to our garage and we put the bikes in the garage. He even gives up a bike rack we can attach to the back of our car. It‚Äôs 7:30pm and dinner hasn‚Äôt been started yet, so I head inside why Z and his dad chat in the garage and start making a really quick stir fry with some frozen veggies, leftover zucchini, and leftover steak. I use a store bought sauce that I fancy up with some spices and seasonings in the pantry and dinner is ready in 20 minutes. We watch the last episode of The Curse by Nathan Fielder and it‚Äôs so insanely trippy I can‚Äôt even begin to summarize my thoughts. I read through the subreddit for The Curse and read a few reviews I found online before calling it a night.

**Saturday:** Saturday‚Äôs are usually our spendiest days as we tend to do a lot of our out-of-house shopping tasks on Saturday. Z and I wake up at 8am and start getting ready. I‚Äôm doing a double header of classes at the studio this morning so I get into workout gear and spend way too long braiding my hair. Usually Z will come downtown with me and work in a coffee shop on campaign things while I‚Äôm in class but he‚Äôs no where near ready when I need to leave for class or I‚Äôll be late. He decides to stay home and do a few more spring cleaning tasks and we‚Äôll go out when I get back. First up in a 45 minute group strength class where we work on muscle groups from largest to smallest, set to music and it‚Äôs SO FUN. It‚Äôs my first time ever doing this class but it itches that recovering marching band addict in my brain. After that, I do an hour long restorative yoga class and feel nice and refreshed afterwards. **$14**

I call Z after class and we discuss lunch options which results in me driving over to our favorite local deli and it‚Äôs closed so I drive home. I‚Äôm ravenous after two back to back classes and start eating trail mix while Z gets ready. We decide to grab Tropical Smoothie Cafe **$25** before making a return at Joann Fabrics $11 and going to get cat food and litter. **$79** We also end up in Target for a lot of household needs and they got a target circle deal for $15 gift card if you buy $50 in household care items. We also bought some easter candy and ice cream, a cute toy for the cats, refill razors for Z, conditioner, a new pair of tennis shoes and some socks for me, and two shirts for Z for work/campaigning. **$178**

We head home after this and put away everything we got while we were out. We open the cats new toy and play with them with it, before hanging out on the couch where I end up taking a two hour nap. When I wake up I feel really refreshed and my oura ring scores shot way up. I make dinner of meatloaf, mac & cheese, and mashed potatoes. From here, the rest of our evening is just eating dinner and watching Poor Things. I end up having a mini ice cream sandwich with a spoon of whipped cream and fall asleep pretty early.

**Sunday:** I wake up at about 8am which is actually 7am but time change :( . I send my mom a text to make sure she‚Äôs up and coming to 10am yoga. She‚Äôs heading out soon! My quads are so insanely stiff and sore this morning. I struggle a lot with DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness) and have my entire life so this pain will only get worse for the next 24-48 hours. I stretch and get changed and work on writing this MD which feels very meta. I head out to yoga with a game plan to call Z when mom and I are done so he can join us for brunch in town. I get to the studio and set up props for mom and I and chat with some of the girls in the studio who are also very sore from the weights class on Saturday. Mom cuts it close, but makes it in the studio and gets set up just in time for class to start. I love this instructor SO much, she teaches a very dynamic stretching flow for all skill levels and shows an awesome variation for pigeon pose that uses a bolster that my mom and I gush over after class. **$7** I call Z and let him know we are heading over to the restaurant for brunch.

I‚Äôm the person that loves to share food when eating with family. My mom orders a breakfast pizza, Z orders stuffed french toast w/ half order of biscuits and gravy, and I get coffee cake w/ a side of bacon. I eat a piece of my moms breakfast pizza and it is so insanely good. I dip my crust in some of Z‚Äôs gravy. The coffee cake is orange and sage flavored and this is not the first time I‚Äôve had it. Z‚Äôs french toast is good, but not for me. He thinks the coffee cake is too sweet, so we end up with our respective meals. Typically we are a switch meals half way through kind of couple. Z pays because our rewards account is under his card, and we end up with 11 dollars off our meal. **$47 w/ 25% tip.** I drive my mom back to her car and we end up sitting around gossiping for a bit before she heads home. I get home and change into pj‚Äôs and play with the cats for a bit with their new toy. Z updates me on the outline he‚Äôs putting together for a project he and a friend are working on. I hang out on the couch with grandpa at my feet and play switch for a few hours. I‚Äôm really late to the game, but I‚Äôm currently playing Tears of the Kingdom and working on the Fire Temple. I ask Z to switch spots with me so I can charge the switch and play on the monitor at our desk. We do this/Z ends up playing Baulders Gate 3 until dinner time. We almost always order food on Sunday nights and make the poor decision to order Taco Bell after partaking in some devil‚Äôs lettuce. **$37 w/ tip**. We have dinner and watch youtube on the couch for an hour before I head off to bed.

**Monday:** Waking up really sucks today, it‚Äôs dark out and hellbender bites at my feet after our first alarm so I don‚Äôt even get to enjoy hitting snooze. Z and I shower, get ready, and I get out the door later that normal. I‚Äôm at the office by 8:30am but today our sewer line is being replaced‚Ä¶ we are not allowed to use the bathroom after 9:15am. We have some auto transfers that happen every monday. $50‚Äôs each to our brokerage accounts and $100 each to our Roth IRAs. **$300** total. By 10:45 I already have to pee and decide I‚Äôll see how poorly this whole toilets thing is going for everyone else. Someone at my office is 39 weeks pregnant so she has claimed a bathroom as hers and is just peeing ontop of her own pee at this point. I‚Äôm definitely not up to peeing on top of my coworkers pee or trying to squat in view of the many cameras on property so I get in my car and head to the closest gas station. Halfway into my ten mile drive back into civilization I realize I‚Äôm going to be spending 30 minutes of my life today just going pee ONCE and that there is no way in hell that me, someone who pees every 60-75 minutes, am working from the office in this condition.

I text my supervisor to inform her and update my lab tech that she can go home if she wishes and work from home. I head home, have lunch with Z and set up at the desk in the living room to work on my powerpoint for the conference next week. This is the same location where I play switch a lot, so it‚Äôs a lot of fighting myself to get work done and not just say fuck it and do what I want to do instead. I make it to 4pm before caving and playing some tears of the kingdom until I need to leave for my 5:15 warm yoga class. My legs aren‚Äôt hurting as bad as they did this morning thank goodness, or I would not have made it through class. **$7** I stop at Aldi and grab a bag of lettuce, chicken, coffee, two yakisoba noodles for Z, and dryer sheets. **$18.12** I stop and get gas for car #1. **$33** I want to make a pasta with some leftover veggies, but I meant to pick up some frozen garlic knots at aldi but forgot. I decide I‚Äôll try and make them myself which I‚Äôve done a few times. They turn out‚Ä¶ okay. I should have added more salt to the dough but they still get the job done! We end up with a zucchini, onion, and pea alfredo pasta with the last of our leftover steak.

Z and I watch the first episode of season 5 of New Girl and then we clean up the kitchen. I make us brownie sundaes with leftover brownies from the catered lunch last week that I brought home. I always forget home much I love rainbow sprinkles! I play Switch for an hour before Z and I go to bed around 9:30pm.

**Tuesday:**

Getting up sucks again! I wake up and hellbender has all 4 of his paws touching my back which is cute. I get ready and pack my lunch (leftovers from last night). Z is reading on the couch when I leave, man what I would give to not have to commute every day. Lots of weird tasks today, I order a chemical cabinet that I should have ordered last week as well as I make an order for more sampling bottles for some of our remote offices. I work on my presentation until lunch time when my coworker and I head up to the new laboratory to see the office furniture is being built! It looks so good! After lunch, I‚Äôve got an email from a lake we work closely with wanting to partner on a case study that will help bring the department I‚Äôm working on starting into fruition. I spend the next three hours deeply focused on creating some guidance documents, identifying the needs we will need to develop this project, reading a research paper that outlines a similar case study I would want to utilize as a guide, and chatting with my coworkers about the feasibility of doing this project as a cost-share project. The whole idea of this new department is to address the ROOT causation of harmful algal blooms and nuisance aquatic vegetation via sediment analysis and phosphorus management. I make some notes to bring to my coworkers who are helping guide me on this journey of mine as they are mentoring me through this process as they both have started and grown their own departments at our company.

I start packing up around 3:45 so I can make it to my 4:30 pilates reformer class. When I get to the studio it‚Äôs just 3 of today and it‚Äôs a pretty great but quick workout. My instructor is about to be gone for approximately 8 weeks without anyone replacing her and I‚Äôm going to miss these pilates classes while shes off doing some training hours and getting some medical work done. I stay after class chatting with her and helping clean up the studio. **$7** While I was in class, Z went to the bank to work on getting his bank account for his campaign. They  can‚Äôt help him because they aren‚Äôt sure what to do? So he goes to lowes and buys some new lights for our kitchen. He spends **$17.48**. I head home and tell Z we have to go outside it‚Äôs so nice today. His idea of fun is to get on the roof and clean our dryer vent‚Ä¶. I hold the ladder to help get him up there but once he‚Äôs up there I go around to the garden beds and pull weeds and leftover stems from last season that I never pulled out. I left my tomatoes and peppers in the ground to try and encourage any leftover fruit/vegetables on the stems to leave some seeds behind to volunteer plant themselves so I don‚Äôt have to buy new starts (I‚Äôve grown my own seedlings before, I just didn‚Äôt have the time this year with Z running for local office). The dry stems staying up over fall and winter can also provide a safe place for overwintering bugs in their egg or pupae state, before pulling them up I make sure that theres no stragglers but they are all clear. I have almost an entire garden bed of strawberries already growing and my rhubarb in the same bed is poking through the dirt! I trim back the asparagus stems I left up as well for bug habitat. Z is done on the roof so I hold the ladder so he can come down. The cats are sitting at the back window and looking at us so concerned it‚Äôs frankly adorable.

We have a jack‚Äôs pizza for dinner with salad on the side. I have a bowl of vanilla ice cream with a ton of rainbow sprinkles as we watch 2 episodes of New Girl and then play our respective video games. Another night of going to bed earlier than normal at 9:30  as I still feel so messed up from the time change.

**Reflection:** It‚Äôs really interesting to write up a new money diary! First, reflecting on how my life has changed since my first money diary. We have had some lifestyle creep since our last diary. I attended a LOT of classes this week, which was more than I think I‚Äôve ever attended before at my studio but we had some really awesome classes that aligned with my schedule during this time period. There a lot of things that have changed in our lives, like 2 cat additions we didn‚Äôt have and we have slowed down our lego collecting a LOT since early pandemic days. We still have a LOT of legos, but we routinely take them apart and let our friends build them/use them as decor in their homes too. I never expected to see my salary change as dramatically but it has been a huge blessing since my husband has had 1-2% salary increases annually since starting his job right after my first money diary.

Reflecting on this week in particular, there was a dramatic LACK of entertainment spending which is VERY not like us. We usually have SOME sort of entertainment expense each week wether it‚Äôs for future concerts/events or simple stuff like the movies or buying a new video game. We have both been playing games we‚Äôve had for a long time, focusing on local events that tend to be free, or don‚Äôt have a ton of plans coming up as we have a long summer of doorknocking ahead of us for Z‚Äôs campaign. Our next big trip is in September for a string of concerts for our favorite band in Red Rocks, The Gorge, and several venues in the PNW. But it shouldn‚Äôt be too expensive as we will be camping and hosteling with friends as we travel around. We definitely spend more on food/eating out than necessary, but it is better than it has been in the past! It definitely still fits within our 50/30/20 so I‚Äôm not too worried about it.

**Totals for the Week:**

**Food:  $249.03**

**Entertainment: $0**

**Home + Health: $244.48**

**Clothes + Beauty:  $27.78**

When we explore the etymology of the word 'Maldives'&#044; we uncover a rich linguistic history that connects this beautiful country to its surrounding region.The word 'Maldives' is derived from the Sanskrit word 'Maladvipa'&#044; which means 'garland of islands'. This name perfectly captures the essence of this stunning archipelago located in the Indian Ocean.The Maldives&#044; an independent country&#044; is a tropical paradise consisting of 26 coral atolls and over 1&#044;000 islands.

However&#044; in 947 AD&#044; the Maldives began to establish contact with the outside world. This marked the beginning of a new era for the Maldivian people&#044; as they started to engage with foreign traders&#044; explorers&#044; and merchants who arrived on their shores.In the 12th century&#044; the Maldives transformed into a sultanate&#044; with the establishment of a centralized government led by sultans.

This marked a significant turning point in the country's history&#044; shaping its cultural and societal norms.

The ancient Hukuru Miskiy mosque&#044; built in 1656&#044; stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of the Islamic period in the Maldives.During the Islamic period&#044; the Maldives developed a unique blend of Islamic and local traditions. The religion played a central role in the lives of the Maldivian people&#044; influencing everything from daily rituals to governance. As a result&#044; the Maldivian islands became centers of Islamic learning and culture.The introduction of Islam also had a significant impact on the economy of the Maldives. The shift from a predominantly agricultural society to a more trade-oriented one was influenced by Islamic teachings. The Maldives established trade links with neighboring countries such as Sri Lanka and India&#044; further enriching its cultural and economic landscape.Today&#044; the Islamic period continues to shape the Maldives&#044; particularly in terms of its architecture and religious practices.

Under British protectorate from 1887 to 1965&#044; the Sultanate's powers were suspended&#044; and a chief minister was introduced&#044; altering the traditional governance structure. This period also saw the proclamation of the first Maldivian constitution in 1932&#044; which faced opposition and was subsequently annulled. The British protectorate status facilitated the establishment of British military presence&#044; shaping the defense strategies of the Maldives. However&#044; the transition from protectorate to independence in 1965 marked a pivotal moment in Maldivian history. The country asserted its sovereignty and embarked on a new era of self-governance&#044; free from direct British colonial oversight.

373,https://www.reddit.com/r/RegenerativeAg/comments/1az4d39/nutrient_balance_in_crop/,Nutrient Balance in Crop,"Finding the perfect balance of nutrients is paramount in crop production, and nowhere is this more crucial than with nitrogen. As a cornerstone for robust growth and optimal productivity, nitrogen is indispensable to plants. However, an excess of this vital nutrient can trigger a chain of problems, affecting both crops and the environment.

**Challenges of Nitrogen Excess**

* Nitrogen runoff into rivers and lakes contributes to eutrophication, a process where excessive nutrients stimulate the growth of algae. Algal blooms can deplete oxygen levels in the water, causing harm to aquatic ecosystems and leading to ""dead zones.""
* Nitrogen leaching into groundwater and surface water contributes to water pollution.
* Nitrous oxide, released from nitrogen-enriched soils, has a significant impact on global warming. It is approximately 300 times more effective in trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period.
* Excessive nitrogen can negatively affect the quality of crops. Too much nitrogen can lead to imbalances with other nutrients, having an impact on the nutritional content of the harvested crops.
* Excessive nitrogen promotes leaf and stem growth at the expense of flowers and fruits, affecting overall productivity.
* Excessive nitrogen can contribute to soil acidification, altering the pH of the soil. This can affect the availability of essential nutrients for plants and soil microorganisms, impacting overall soil health.
* Plants with excess nitrogen may exhibit reduced efficiency in utilizing other nutrients, leading to a less optimal nutrient balance in the plant tissues.

**How do we ensure plants receive the right nitrogen levels?**

Plant Sap Analysis provides real-time insights into the plant's nutrient status, allowing for precise adjustments to promote optimal growth with:

* Timely Intervention:Identify nitrogen excess before visible symptoms manifest, enabling prompt corrective measures.
* Quantitative Precision:Accurate data on nitrogen concentrations aids in precise fertilizer adjustments.
* Dynamic Monitoring: Track nitrogen levels throughout the growing season, adapting strategies to changing crop needs.

üå± SoilBeat further simplifies the detection of potential soil deficits with its intuitive alert system, which not only notifies you promptly about possible excesses but also takes it a step further by guiding you through your next steps with insightful microlearnings.

**‚ÄòLike the flip of a switch, it‚Äôs gone‚Äô: has the ecosystem of the UK‚Äôs largest lake collapsed?**

*Lough Neagh‚Äôs flies were seen as a nuisance. Now their sudden disappearance is a startling omen for a lake that supplies 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs water*

Declan Coney, a former eel fisher, knew there was something wrong when the famed swarms of Lough Neagh flies failed to materialise. In past years, they would appear around the Northern Irish lake in thick plumes and ‚Äúwisps‚Äù ‚Äì sometimes prompting mistaken alarm of a fire incident, Lough Shore residents say.

Clothes left out on a washing line ‚Äúwould be covered in them‚Äù, Coney says. So would any windshield on a vehicle travelling around the lough‚Äôs 90-mile shoreline. Conservationists marvelled at their courtship dances, hovering above treetops.

Last spring the flies never arrived. ‚ÄúThis is the first year ever that, if you walked up to the Cross of Ardboe or the area around there, you‚Äôd find there‚Äôs no flies,‚Äù Coney says.

The flies were long considered a nuisance. Now, however, alarm is growing. ‚ÄúPeople have really been scared,‚Äù he says, by the rate of accelerated change to the lough‚Äôs ecology that their absence signals. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just happened. Like the flip of a switch, it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúLough Neagh fly‚Äù can refer to various non-biting midges, but these crucial insects support fish and wildfowl that are endemic to the lough system, as well as frogs and predatory insects. The loss of these keystone species, alongside sharp reductions of others, the spread of invasive species like zebra mussels, and a long-term deterioration in water quality, indicates deep trouble across the lough‚Äôs entire ecology. It also raises the prospect that this shallow body of water and its surrounding wetlands may have shifted beyond a state of decline into cascading ecosystem collapse.

Lough Neagh ‚Äì the largest freshwater lake in the UK ‚Äì supplies more than 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs drinking water, and hosts the largest wild eel fishery in Europe. It is considered a cultural and archaeological ‚Äújewel‚Äù that reaches ‚Äúway back‚Äù into the very beginning of shared memory on the island.

Last summer, a vast ‚Äúbloom‚Äù of blue-green algae ‚Äì a thick, photosynthesising blanket that deprives the lake of oxygen, choking aquatic life ‚Äì brought the lough‚Äôs accelerating biodiversity crisis into sharp focus. It prompted considerable public outcry and is expected to return in ‚Äúmore severe‚Äù form this coming summer.

The toxic algal growth ‚Äì described by local people as appearing like something otherworldly due to its brilliant green or blue appearance ‚Äì has since disappeared from the surface of the lough, but remains visibly suspended just underneath.

The problems have been exacerbated by the paralysis of Northern Ireland‚Äôs power-sharing institutions, which have been dormant for 40% of the period since they were formed by the Good Friday agreement, including almost all of the past two years. Members of the devolved assembly only began debating the management of the lough last week. As the politicians gathered, new reports emerged of a thick, pale scum appearing on the lough‚Äôs waterways.

From the mouth of the River Blackwater, Ciar√°n Breen rows out on to Lough Neagh. Breen has spent about three decades working on this body of water. His vessel is a cot, a small wooden boat he helped to build by the shores of Maghery, a village near Portadown on the lough‚Äôs southern end.

Breen pauses to take stock of the losses he has witnessed since he began work here as a wildlife ranger in 1986.

‚ÄúIn the winter, we did an annual wildfowl count ‚Äì a colleague and I did this particular section,‚Äù he says, gesturing towards an area of several square kilometres between Coney Island and Kells Point.

‚ÄúWe got about 50,000-60,000 diving ducks. So many that people ‚Äì our bosses, I mean ‚Äì came out of Belfast to take a look for themselves, since they didn‚Äôt believe us at first.‚Äù

These fleets of pochard, scaup and goldeneye made Lough Neagh an internationally significant site for overwintering birds in the 1980s. In the years since, their numbers have plummeted. A 2013 study found that the number of these winter migratory birds at the lough had dropped nearly 80% in a decade ‚Äì from 100,000 to fewer than 21,000.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking out there ‚Äì at the same spot ‚Äì now,‚Äù Breen says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a wee flock of coot and no ducks. None. So there‚Äôs been a catastrophic collapse in duck numbers from when I started.‚Äù

Overwintering whooper swans from Iceland used to arrive as December approached. ‚ÄúFor many years, they would herald the winter coming in,‚Äù says Tom McElhone, who lives near a disused freshwater laboratory at Tra√°d Point on the lough‚Äôs north-western shore ‚Äì its last major research facility, which closed in the early 2000s.

‚ÄúI remember lying in bed and hearing these swans calling out to each other, up and down the lough, having this magnificent conversation at all hours of the night. That‚Äôs all gone.‚Äù

Even when they move away from it, Lough Neagh courses through the veins of those like Coney, raised on its south-western shores, who have worked the water or resided within one of its many tight-knit local communities.

The 53-year-old believes, however, that many of the social ties and customs that helped fuse together these shoreline villages, parishes and townlands have unravelled during his lifetime, mirroring a progressive decline of the lough‚Äôs central fishing industry.

As the number of boats fishing the waters has dwindled ‚Äì from more than 200 in the 1980s to a few dozen today ‚Äì so too, he says, have the summer fairs and ‚Äúlough shore tug of wars‚Äù, the ad-hoc music sessions, hyperlocal vernacular ‚Äì even residents‚Äô familiarity with the water body itself.

‚ÄúThe local knowledge is not there any more,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd that sense of togetherness along the lough shore is just gone.‚Äù

Along the walls of the Toome Canal, at the north-western tip of Lough Neagh, chalk-like bright blue residue from the algal blooms was visible for weeks after the thick sludge of surface algae had disappeared from sight. Warning signs have remained in place at sites such as Ballyronan throughout the Christmas holidays and into early 2024.

The algal growths have robbed people not only of this year‚Äôs summer craic ‚Äì families around the lough, say ‚Äì but also of something calming, restorative, even ‚Äúhealing‚Äù.

And they have also prompted a belated ‚Äúawakening‚Äù to the lough‚Äôs plight, in the words of the lough shore resident and former MP for Mid-Ulster, Bernadette McAliskey (nee Devlin).

She and other veteran civil rights leaders ‚Äì who took up the cause of the area‚Äôs disfranchised fishers in the 1960s ‚Äì have been speaking up for the lough once again.

Addressing a rain-drenched demonstration by the same canal in late November, just a stone‚Äôs throw from the eel fishery‚Äôs headquarters, McAliskey cited talks to bring the lough into a community co-operative trust nearly a decade ago. It was one of a number of lost opportunities for public ownership over the past 50 years.

‚ÄúOur evidence was [that] people look after what belongs to them,‚Äù she said.

Ownership of Lough Neagh has a long and contentious history. The aristocratic Shaftesbury family has claimed the lough‚Äôs bed, banks and soil since the 19th century, having been given the asset by the Chichester family, whose territorial claim dates back to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 1600s.

The lough‚Äôs fishing communities were once bound together by a history of struggle in defending public rights to fish the lough that, in the words of House of Lords judges at a key 1911 appeal case, had been exercised ‚Äúfrom time immemorial‚Äù. But now, Coney says, many have become despondent due to mismanagement of the water body, and a ‚Äúlack of industry support‚Äù or apparent outside interest.

Those who fish for the increasingly emaciated, scattered eels only managed three weeks last season, which would usually run from May to late October.

The lough‚Äôs ecological and economic decline is now playing out amid fragmented management structures, and a lack of key scientific data ‚Äì ecological ‚Äúbaselines‚Äù.

Local communities fear that the lough may be sold on to a new private owner ‚Äì a prospect the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury has not ruled out publicly. Among many, there is a profound lack of trust or confidence in management and governing bodies.

‚ÄúThe priority has to be sustaining the life of the lough,‚Äù McAliskey told the Toome rally. ‚ÄúBecause if we sustain the life of Lough Neagh together, Lough Neagh will sustain the rest of us. So long as we work in harmony with her, there is a living [here] for everybody.

‚ÄúThis whole lough could be an income generator that keeps all of our young people from emigrating to the cities and emigrating out of the country. We could have a really good life around this lough, while supporting the rest of the ecology.‚Äù

But Breen, who has also worked in government, is less optimistic.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre hoping this will blow over, now the algae‚Äôs disappeared from sight‚Äù, he says of decision-makers and government, ‚Äúand that it‚Äôll be back to business as usual.‚Äù",19 Feb 2024 10:04:47,reddit

It seems to make the herd hallucinate.

When Clark seizes, he's got a dusting of snow on his coat, so he was just outside at the same time.

Asked ChatGPT: ""150 miles north of the arctic circle, what kind of substance in a cloud could explain hallucinations/panicking of a herd of caribou?""

Response:

> The phenomenon of hallucinations or panic in a herd of caribou 150 miles north of the Arctic Circle, attributed to a substance in clouds, could be theoretically explained by a few speculative and environmental factors, although it's important to note that such a scenario is highly unusual and would require specific and rare conditions. Here are some possibilities:

> Toxic Algal Blooms: While typically associated with aquatic environments, the toxins produced by algal blooms (such as neurotoxins from harmful algae) can become aerosolized under certain conditions. If these toxins were to be carried into cloud formations and subsequently deposited in an area with caribou through precipitation, it could potentially affect their neurological systems. However, the feasibility of this scenario occurring in the Arctic, and specifically through clouds, is highly speculative and unprecedented in scientific literature.

> Volcanic Gases: Volcanic eruptions can release a variety of gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), into the atmosphere. These gases can travel long distances and, under specific atmospheric conditions, could potentially be associated with cloud formations. High concentrations of these gases can have toxic effects on wildlife, including disorientation or panic. However, the presence and effect of such gases in the Arctic region, transported by clouds, would be a rare event.

> Anthropogenic Chemicals: Industrial pollutants and chemicals can travel long distances in the atmosphere. Certain chemicals, if present in high concentrations, could potentially cause disorientation or neurological effects in wildlife. This would require a significant and concentrated release of chemicals that somehow become encapsulated within cloud formations and then precipitated out, which is a highly speculative scenario.

> Mycotoxins from Fungi: Certain types of fungi produce mycotoxins that can be harmful to animals and humans. In theory, spores from these fungi could become airborne and, under the right conditions, could be involved in cloud formation or precipitation, leading to exposure in wildlife. This scenario, however, is highly speculative and there's no direct evidence to suggest it occurs in nature in the manner described.

> Natural Gas Emissions: Methane and other natural gases can seep from the ground in areas rich in organic deposits or where there is geothermal activity. If such gases were somehow to become concentrated in cloud formations and affect animal behavior, it would represent a novel and undocumented phenomenon.

> It's crucial to emphasize that these scenarios are speculative and not based on documented scientific phenomena. The direct link between specific substances in clouds causing hallucinations or panic in caribou herds would require a novel mechanism of environmental interaction that has yet to be observed or studied in detail. Realistically, environmental stressors that lead to panic or unusual behavior in wildlife are often more terrestrial or direct in nature, such as predation pressure, human activity, or direct exposure to toxins in their environment.

I find both toxic algal blooms and mycotoxins from fungi particularly fascinating here, as Clark was specifically researching cyanobacteria and Alternaria (black mold).

Asking a followup: ""Could the absence of sunlight contribute to any of these factors?""

> Changes in Microbial Activity: The absence of sunlight can alter the temperature and moisture conditions in the environment, which can affect microbial and fungal activity. In theory, increased fungal activity could lead to higher concentrations of spores or mycotoxins in the environment. While this could affect animal health if ingested or inhaled directly, the connection to cloud-borne substances is speculative.

The timing of the black water appearing in the Villages is the same as the last sunset, is the same as the caribou herd freakout, is the same as Clark's seizure, etc. They all have the absence of light in common.

In another post I shared a research paper studying the impact of blue light and its absence on black mold. Blue light increases mycotoxin production by 2-3x, and it's absence causes spore proliferation.

Abnormal amounts of blue-green light also turns cyanobacteria... orange. In the opening credits, twice we see a setup of blue-green lights surrounding one orange rod. What were they doing there?",08 Feb 2024 15:00:09,reddit

386,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aj42c1,SotB: finally getting the sound I want,"I've still got some plans for it I'll lay out later on on the post but I'm very happy with my recent reshuffle.

Signal chain:

Guitar (Fender Telecaster, I have 4 but I mostly use a silver 75th anniversary edition) - ES8 - TC Electronic Sentry noise gate - Empress Compressor - Wampler Dracarys - Fuzzhugger Doom Bloom - Fuzzhugger Algal Bloom - Amp (Hughes and Kettner Tubemeister 40) in the volume loop - Empress Tremolo - Old Blood Noise Endeavours Sunlight - Walrus Audio Lore - Amp - DI out via XLR to AXE I/O audio interface and I listen on headphones (Sennheiser HD 650).

The increased headroom on the axe over my old gen 2 focusrite scarlet has been the biggest help to getting the tone I want. 

Each pedal is in a loop of the ES8 (except the tuner which is direct out of the ES8. That tiny switch on the bottom right is a tap tempo (Bright Onion Pedals) controlling the BPM of the ES8, which syncs with the Tremolo by midi. Having the tap tempo next to the tap tempo of the lore allows me to hit both at the same time.

ES8

There are four patches on the ES8 (though I create custom ones for specific purposes that I have to switch to with the editor as I use the bank buttons for something else):

1 Tidy - noise gate, compressor
2 110 - noise gate, compressor, algal bloom
3 Doom - noise gate, compressor, doom bloom
4 Dracarys - noise gate, compressor, Dracarys

Pressing the same button again depends on the patch but the theme is adding gain/boosting:

Patches 1, 3, and 4 enables algal bloom
Patch 2 enables the doom bloom

Button 5 is supposed to enable the hold function on the sunlight but I can't get it to work. I followed a tutorial by man bun metal head on YouTube where he setup the same thing but it won't work for me. It probably th cable not being a proper tea cable so I will get one and try again soon.

Button 6 enables the Tremolo. Button 7 enables the sunlight and button 8 enables the lore. Both of them have trails so I switch patches or disable the loop and still get the remainder of the effect.

Bank down sets the trem to square wave and bank up sets to triangle wave. All automatically tell the trem to a triangle wave with a depth of about half except patch 4 which is defaulted to a very quick square wave with full depth.

Pedals

I would ultimately like to take the noise gate away butmy problem is I have to stand fairly close to the amp in that room and I get feedback when using higher gain.

The compressor isn't theost subtle setting but it's blended with clean signal which calms it down. I love seeing the LEDs show me the compression as I play. I am considering upgrading to a MK2, for space if nothing else.

Dracarys is awesome. It's the only distortion pedal I ever actually liked (though I haven't tried a lot). I use it mostly for playing guns n roses with my black Mexican Tele.

The Algal Bloom is everything the Sparkle Drive could never before me. I use it as a slightly messy overdrive with clean blend.

The Doom Bloom sounds great and both blooms are amazing with chords and open strings, with is a big part of my style. I particularly like using it along with the sunlight for black metal.

I took the trem off as part of my recent reshuffle and immediately regretted it and put it back on. The only thing likely to displace it is a Lightfoot labs goatkeeper, though I have no plans to do that for the foreseeable future.

The sunlight and lore are both new and I have been enjoying them both. I got fed up with never getting modulation sounds I like and sold every phaser, chorus, and assorted other modulation I had. I don't expect to ever buy any single mod pedals anytime soon. If I need modulation I can do it with plug ins. I also took off my dd7 for the first time since I got it something like 15 years ago now.

The tuner has a power out so its powering the empress midi port too. The patch bay at the back is a gigrig cinqo. The power supply underneath is a Friedman something with 10x 9v ports.

Plans

I was just starting to look into replacing my amp with a pedal and kma announced the endgame, so I will wait for more information on it. It looks perfect for my needs but I need to hear and understand more before I commit. I'm wondering about eq control if I used that instead of an amp. If I needed it I'd get an empress paraeq MK2.

That will require a new power supply though and so far the voodoo labs pedal power 3 is in the lead, though I noticed fender have released a power supplythatmay also work for me (LV 12).

Of course that will also likely to necessitate a new board. I like the Friedman ones with two tiers but it would probably be easier and cheaper to ask a carpenter friend of mine to knock something up for me.

That may lead me to having a free space for another pedal. I've got some other nice ones I'd like to use like my BlackArt Toneworks Pharoah and Fnord.",04 Feb 2024 20:08:28,reddit

Over the last year, **I** **built 58 different finished pedals** and I wanted to share with you what I learned, my top **choices**, and what I would like to **improve** about each circuit for future updates.

Explaining each 58 pedals on its own would be a hell of a long thread so I decided to cut it into chunks grouped by category.

For each pedal, I'll write down:

* **What it is**
* **What do I like**
* **What can we improve/ What I didn't like about the pedal?**

Let's begin with FUZZES. Cause we all love fuzzes :D

**During 2023 I built 20** fuzzes in total, almost one a half per month :D

I'll rank the first 10 according to my personal taste from my most favorite to the least favorite. Maybe there are hot points here, and maybe you agree with me, but this is just my criteria, considering mostly how much fun I had playing with the pedal and how innovative the design itself is.

I'm only ranking the first 10 cause after that the line gets too fuzzy :p

1. **Blackout Effectors Musket Fuzz**
2. **Mountain king Megalith**
3. **EQD Bit Commander**
4. **FuzzHugger Algal Bloom**
5. **Boss FZ-2**
6. **Basic Audio Scarab Deluxe**
7. **Cornish NG-2**
8. **Frantone Peach Fuzz**
9. **Analogman Sunface**
10. **Death By Audio Fuzz War I**

&#x200B;

**Blackout Effectors Musket Fuzz**

Okay, the Black Musket Fuzz is definitely one of my all-time favorite muffs. It's super versatile and has most of the features every muff enthusiast always wants, like a mids control to cut through the mix and a focus knob for everything from tight to fat tones. Plus, it's got a fixed LPB1 boost in front, really making it blast your speakers. Overall, it's a fantastic fuzz, and I love everything the guys at Blackart Tone Works did with this pedal. It's a huge inspiration for the Mega Muff project I'm working on.

What can we improve in this pedal? Maybe an on-off footswitch for the Pre-booster? I really dont know this pedal for me is perfect. The only mod I did was swapping a capacitor in the tone section for extra range of action.

**Mountain king Megalith**

I always consider the Mountain King Megalith as one of the best original fuzzes, delivering massive, thick, gritty, saturated, doomy tones. However, I really don't like pedals that are bigger than necessary. Sure, they're fun and look cool, but they're impractical. That's why I decided to build a compact version, tweaking values and experimenting with different transistors. Like the Fuzz Factory, this is a great build for beginners who want massive sounds with minimal components. I personally think this pedal could benefit a lot from a clean blend, making it more versatile. In a future version of this circuit, I'd improve the graphics and correctly place the LEDs in the eyes of the Rapa Nuis I did for the artwork, similar to what we did with the Fender Blender

**EQD Bit Commander**

This isn't the first Bit Commander I've built, but I had some surplus parts from a previous run, so I decided to build one just for fun. I used an old, beaten-up yellow enclosure that ended up giving it a much-loved vintage arcade machine look. In terms of modifications, I changed some capacitors in the filter section to make it more responsive at the high end. I'd love to do a run of this in the future. I think adding the input impedance buffer and the pickup simulator from the Erupter by EQD could be great here, as this circuit is known for not working well with lower impedance pickups, like those in a Telecaster or Stratocaster.

**FuzzHugger Algal Bloom**

What it is: Inspired by the early 4-knob version of the FuzzHugger Algal Bloom

What I like about it: This pedal really stands out for its harmonic and chord clarity. It's the kind of pedal that lets you hear each string defined, clear, and crisp.

What can be improved: Given its sensitivity to biasing effects, I'm considering replacing the bias resistors of each transistor with variable resistors. This would allow for more control over the behavior of the transistors.

**Boss FZ-2**  
What it is: I called my version of the BOSS FZ-2 Fuzzeus. I didn't make many changes to this one, so it remains quite loyal to the original.

What I like about it: I must admit, I'm usually not a fan of Boss pedals, except for the HM-2 I loved growing up. I wasn't too enthusiastic about building this one, but the fuzz on this pedal is incredible. It's very unique, yet familiar. I'd rank it as my second favorite Boss pedal, right after the classic HM2.

What can be improved: Firstly, the artwork and the name. I've never been fond of them, and I did them quite hastily for the enclosure orders. They don't really capture the essence of this beast. Secondly, for building purposes, I'd swap the toggle for a rotary switch, perhaps syncing it with the LEDs to make the eyes of the character glow. Adding a mid-boost after the active EQ section would also be a great addition.

**Basic Audio Scarab Deluxe**

What it is: This pedal is my version of the heavily modified Silicon Tone Bender MKII, the Basic Audio's Scarab fuzz.

What I like about it: I appreciate its versatility and complexity, making it great for riffing and leads with many sweet spots. The Bias control and Fat knob offer a diverse tone range, from gated and gritty to sustaining leads and clean overdrive. The Kafka-inspired artwork, featuring a scarab instead of his face and the Czech flag, is also a highlight for me.

What can be improved: This one's challenging, as it's already well-thought-out. However, expanding the Big Muff tone stack and adding a mids control could enhance it. Incorporating a pre-LPB1 like in the Black Musket might also a cool feature for the everything at eleven gang.

**Cornish NG-2**

This pedal has a really interesting topology, similar to the Big MUFF, with quite interesting peculiarity, it features a front LPB1 BOOST much like the Black Musket fuzz, followed up by 2 gain stages from the Big Muff and finishes with a fuzz face type of section as a post boost. Very interesting circuit.   
The concept of the Fuzz face as a post-effect thing is something I‚Äôd really like to try on the Mega Muff project.

**Frantone Peach Fuzz**

* What it is: A heavily modified Frantone's Peach Fuzz focused on increasing touch sensitivity and dynamics. A very unique fuzz combines a pre-gain stage followed by a gain stage much similar to the Acapulco Gold and closes with a Bigh muff tone stack.
* What I like about it: This pedal excels in clarity and definition.   
And that is certainly a very unique fuzz structure.
* What can be improved: It‚Äôs almost perfect as it is, as a 3-knob pedal. But As you can imagine by now, I‚Äôm not a big fan of 3 knobs pedals.

As this bad boy reminds me of the Acapulco Gold, I‚Äôd add some toggle to switch between the gain levels, going from the original version to the full dirtiness of the Acapulco.

I‚Äôd also add an expanded EQ, maybe a classic 3 knob passive tone stack.

**Analogman Sunface**

* What it is: The Analog Sun is inspired by Analogman‚Äôs Sunface and is a vintage germanium fuzz pedal, which has its roots in the Arbiter Fuzz Face. It includes an internal trimmer for input sensitivity, allowing for tone adjustments.
* What I like about it: This pedal is excellent for its responsiveness to playing dynamics, offering a touch-sensitive and responsive experience. It‚Äôs definitely one of my favorite classic fuzz face-based pedals. And I mean classic in the sense that it doesn't get crazy like with a fuzz factory or any of that stuff. Only beautiful, usable tones here.
* What can be improved: Well, this Pedal has an internal trimpot labeled clean that is actually a pot that controls how much signal you feed into the circuit, like a guitar volume control. I‚Äôd like to have that one externally, I think it will make quite a difference and be useful for shaping your tone.  
As a fuzz face type of circuit, I think it would benefit a lot from the pickup emulator we covered on the Erupter by EQD. Maybe we can have a toggle for setting it on/off.
* I don't think this pedal particularly needs any extended tone control. It is quite good the way it is. What do you think?

**Death By Audio Fuzz War I**

* Based on the now obsolete OG 7 transistor version of the Fuzz War by DEATH BY AUDIO, a very wild and gritty fuzz that, according to many is the best version of all.   
This was a  circuit that I really dug deep into changing component values to make it more stable and usable. The gain control knob does quite little. I think also a fat focus knob at the input section, like in the Black Musket, would be a great addition.  
Independent bias trim pots for each transistor would be great from the builder's point of view.

&#x200B;

Tell me me what do you think, whats that pedal you have where you have a clear vision of what would you like to mod, change, or tweak to make it better to your taste?

I'll be posting the rest of the pedals ASAP, as well as audio clips and more updates!

390,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_maryteatime/comments/19cqq49/how_does_manure_dewatering_affect_the_environment/,How Does Manure Dewatering Affect the Environment?,"Manure dewatering is a process designed to separate solids from liquid components in manure, resulting in a more concentrated and manageable byproduct. This practice is often employed in agriculture to reduce the volume of manure, facilitate transportation, and enhance nutrient management. While [manure processing](https://tzmachines.com/service/manure-processing-machine/) offers several benefits, it also has potential environmental implications that need careful consideration.

# Benefits of Manure Dewatering

1. Nutrient Concentration:

Manure dewatering helps concentrate nutrients, making it easier to manage and apply to crops. This can enhance the efficiency of nutrient utilization and reduce the risk of over-application, which may lead to nutrient runoff.

2. Easier Transport:

Dewatered manure has a lower moisture content, making it more feasible for transport. This can be especially beneficial when moving manure from livestock facilities to fields where it is used as fertilizer.

[Manure Dewatering Machine for Sale](https://preview.redd.it/zokuo3568ydc1.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a16f0bbfbd712209dd09df4e47bb227f04d1ddf)

3. Odor Reduction:

The solid liquid separation in manure dewatering can help reduce unpleasant odors associated with raw manure. This can contribute to a more favorable environment for both farmers and nearby communities.

4. Pathogen Reduction:

Dewatering can contribute to the reduction of pathogens in manure, as many pathogens are associated with the liquid fraction. This can have positive implications for both animal and human health.

# Environmental Concerns:

1. Nutrient Runoff:

While nutrient concentration is a benefit, there is a risk of nutrient runoff when applying dewatered manure to fields. If not managed properly, the increased nutrient density could contribute to water pollution, leading to issues such as algal blooms and degraded water quality.

2. Energy Consumption:

The manure dewatering process often requires energy-intensive equipment such as centrifuges or mechanical presses. The energy consumption associated with these technologies can contribute to a carbon footprint, especially if the energy comes from non-renewable sources.

3. Solid Waste Disposal:

The separated solids from manure dewatering need appropriate disposal. Improper handling of these solids may lead to environmental issues, including soil contamination. Sustainable disposal methods, such as composting or utilization as a soil amendment, need to be considered.

4. Costs and Scale:

Implementing a [manure dewatering system](https://tzmachines.com/manure-dewatering-machine/) can be costly. For small-scale operations, the financial burden may outweigh the benefits. This raises questions about the economic feasibility and scalability of such practices.

# Best Practices for Sustainable Manure Dewatering:

1. Nutrient Management Plans:

Farmers should develop and follow nutrient management plans to ensure responsible application of dewatered manure. This includes considering soil nutrient levels, crop requirements, and weather conditions.

2. Renewable Energy Sources:

Adoption of renewable energy sources for the dewatering process can mitigate the environmental impact associated with energy consumption. This includes solar or wind-powered systems.

3. Solid Waste Utilization:

Finding beneficial uses for the separated solids, such as composting or using them as a soil amendment, can minimize the environmental impact and turn waste into a valuable resource.

4. Monitoring and Regulation:

Regular monitoring and adherence to environmental regulations are crucial. This ensures that the benefits of manure dewatering are realized without causing harm to the environment.

In conclusion, manure dewatering can be a valuable practice in agriculture, offering benefits such as nutrient concentration and odor reduction. However, its environmental impact must be carefully managed to avoid issues like nutrient runoff and improper waste disposal. With proper planning, technology, and adherence to best practices, manure dewatering can be a sustainable component of modern farming practices.",22 Jan 2024 03:06:09,reddit

Northern Ireland‚Äôs environment is unlikely to benefit from higher EU standards because the country already flouts the existing rules, leaving it in a ‚Äúgrossly degraded‚Äù state, experts have said.

The region may escape a post-Brexit erosion of UK environmental law but still suffer grave environmental damage because of governance failures, they warned.

Northern Ireland has no functioning executive or environmental protection agency and the civil service has not published an environmental strategy or statement of principles.

Under the Windsor framework the region remains subject to EU laws that in many cases are more stringent than those in England, Wales and Scotland.

But Northern Ireland will struggle to exploit that opportunity, said Ciara Brennan, director of the advocacy group Environmental Justice Network Ireland. ‚ÄúIt cannot be absorbed given the already grossly degraded state of the environment here. The crisis at Lough Neagh is symptomatic of how bad things are across the north.‚Äù

A vast algal bloom is choking the largest lake in the British Isles and the source of 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs drinking water. It has been contaminated by slurry and other agricultural runoff as well as human sewage discharges.

Campaigners say the plight of Lough Neagh and a huge illegal waste dump outside Derry reflect a lack of scrutiny, enforcement and accountability that have made Northern Ireland the ‚Äúdirty corner of Europe‚Äù, with the department of agriculture, environment and rural affairs, or Daera, accused of favouring farming interests over the environment. The department did not respond to a request for comment.

Poor governance subverted ambitious EU rules, said James Orr, director of Friends of the Earth in Northern Ireland. ‚ÄúThe only way that environmental standards are maintained is if there are effective watchdogs and enforcement bodies. The difficulty is that those agencies don‚Äôt exist or have been defunded or deprioritised.‚Äù

Great Britain‚Äôs divergence from EU rules might leave Northern Ireland with higher standards, but that was of limited value when the region was an environmental ‚Äúbasket case‚Äù, said Orr. ‚ÄúThere is no effective rule of law when it comes to environmental standards.‚Äù

Retaining EU rules was no reason to ‚Äúdance in the aisles‚Äù given that Northern Ireland has ignored EU rules for decades, said Jim Wells, a former Stormont assembly member of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP). ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre decades behind the rest of the UK and Europe,‚Äù he said.

Any divergence from rules in Great Britain had gone unnoticed because of the parlous state of the region‚Äôs waterways, bogs and other areas, said Wells. He accused nationalist and unionist parties of kowtowing to the Ulster Farmers Union. ‚ÄúThe UFU only have to blink twice and various environmental protections are dropped,‚Äù he said.

Viviane Gravey, a politics lecturer and expert on EU environmental policy at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, said the collapse of the Stormont executive and assembly had left the civil service struggling to fill the vacuum.

‚ÄúThere is all this potential for Northern Ireland to be more ambitious than Great Britain but for that you need to have civil servants capable of doing the work and an environmental agency that has teeth. The civil service is under so much stress and there are so many gaps. Deadlines are being missed.‚Äù

The DUP collapsed power-sharing in January 2022 in protest over the post-Brexit trading arrangements, which the party said weakened Northern Ireland‚Äôs place in the UK and left it under EU sway.

The party cites divergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as justification for a continued boycott that has left the secretary of state, Chris Heaton-Harris, overseeing a civil service that runs the region on a type of auto-pilot, unable or unwilling to take major decisions.

Analysts say this has aggravated environmental neglect that dates back to the Troubles and which continued after the Good Friday agreement when the major parties backed the rapid expansion of industrial factory farms, especially of pigs and poultry, that now contribute to 9m cubic metres of slurry a year.

Northern Ireland was in the ‚Äúsurreal‚Äù situation of not adopting an EU ban on single-use plastics, while England, Wales and Scotland, which were not bound by EU rules, enacted their own ban, said Gravey. However, Northern Ireland‚Äôs new Office for Environmental Protection ‚Äì which can scrutinise but not enforce ‚Äì was prodding the civil service into decisions and greater transparency, she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where I see some hope.‚Äù

The scale of divergence in standards between Northern Ireland and Great Britain remained unclear, said Brennan. ‚ÄúBut you could say the divergence question is academic because if you don‚Äôt have the governance structures in place to implement environmental law then it doesn‚Äôt really matter what the law is.‚Äù",19 Jan 2024 17:49:33,reddit

CW: the opps, a judge (he is also an opp), a detailed plan for domestic terrorism (in minecraft), extreme density

Memory transcription subject: Sevros, Magisterial Judge

Date [standardized human time]: September 17, 2136

I had been relatively unknown these past few weeks. I liked that. I needed that. Because, in my line of work, the people who weren't unknown were starting to end up dead.

Yes, I was officially a judge for the Capital Magistratta. I was a particularly good and just judge, too. My work on the Tomi Industries corruption case was legendary. My prison reforms were even more so. I had climbed my way to the top of the judicial ladder, maybe kicking a few others down as I went, and earned my peers' respect through my own honest labor.

Unofficially, however, I was a pawn for the Predator Guard. I say 'was' because, as of September 11, I was now in supreme command of whatever remnants of it I could get my paws on. Cerso had already fled, most of his lieutenants were arrested or killed, and I was still standing.

My days were numbered, though, and I knew that. That was why I flinched hard when I heard the secretary buzz me. *It's nothing, it's nothing. No one can touch you, Sevros.*

That, while true, didn't reassure me one bit. The local authorities had been mopping up the lower-level members of my organization just fine, and I was allowing them to do so with minimal pushback. Enough to delay them, but not enough to get myself in their crosshairs.

The secretary buzzed me again. *It's nothing. The exterminators have bigger problems right now. It's nothing.*

I needed out. This organization was crashing and burning around me, and if I was lucky, I could escape it with little more than my tail singed. The few assets I had still under my command were dwindling rapidly, and I knew that my enemies were growing bolder.

A third buzz, this one much longer. *It's nothing, it's nothing, it's nothing. Answer it.*

*Class III conspiracy to commit terrorism is 10 years minimum. Class IV judicial corruption is 15 years. Class II obstruction of justice is 12 years. Class-*

Another buzz. My shaking paw tapped the answer button. ""Your honor, Heval is here to see you."" *Oh, thank god.* Heval was one of my top lieutenants, despite the fact that I met him less than a month ago. I trusted him. We had the same goal.

""Send him up."" I breathed, hoping I didn't sound afraid. ""Quickly.""

Some time later, Heval was sitting at my desk. ""Heval."" I greeted him. ""What do you have to report?""

He looked uneasy. Whenever Heval looked uneasy, things were usually bad. Granted, he looked uneasy a lot these days, but that was just a sign of how bad things really were. ""Please tell me something good.""

""The exterminators are distracted again?"" Heval ventured. The exterminators, thankfully, were mostly incompetent by now. The UN's decision to force human cooperation down their throats did drive out most of my contacts within the Guild, but it had the side effect of driving out basically everyone else as well.

Once again, the predators proved their malevolence by disarming our protectors. If Cerso's men hadn't massacred our fellow prey a few weeks ago, we might have stood to profit immensely from this.

I looked around. ""Do I have *any* leverage to use?""

Heval sighed. That was never good. ""Not enough."" That was even worse.

""What about Jelim? Did the hit team succeed?"" I didn't even want to know the answer by now.

""The informant did deliver her to the assigned place."" Heval began. *See? See, Sevros? It's alright. Everything will work out in the end, because that's God's divine plan for you.* ""The hit team set up an ambush for her on the way home, to minimize collateral damage.""

That last part was specifically ordered by me for twofold reasons. The first was that killing innocents was usually looked down upon by law enforcement and the public. The more hated I was, the harder it would be to escape punishment.

The second, and the most important in my opinion, was that I didn't like killing prey. The Predator Guard was meant to be a noble organization that did what the exterminators often could not. People forgot that sometimes, and when we lost sight of our goal it could bring nothing but ruin.

""Where are they holding her?"" I didn't usually assume things went well, but I needed a break. God owed me a break. ""They are holding her captive, right?""

Heval looked uneasy again. ""Sir, the hit failed. The team is dead, apart from one captive."" Like I had said, nothing good ever happened when Heval looked uneasy. I'd tell him to stop doing that, but I doubted he'd listen.

""First of all, stop looking so nervous."" Heval looked at me like I had a few members short of a herd. ""When you look nervous, it gets me nervous, because you and I both know there's something to be nervous about whenever you get nervous.""

""Well... yeah, but that's hardly my fault."" said Heval. ""You get nervous whenever I get nervous because I always get nervous whenever there's something to be nervous about, not because my nervosity is contagious."" That was a pretty good explanation, all things considered.

""Nervosity isn't a word.""

""Whatever. Stop stalling."" *I'm not stalling! Am I?* ""What sort of genius Sevros plan do you have this time?""

I sighed. ""Nothing. Nothing!"" I slammed my head onto my desk. It hurt, but I had bigger problems like avoiding a lengthy prison sentence. ""That woman is my ticket out of here, Heval. I need her in my basement like I need air in my lungs."" *Okay, that sounds wrong. That won't look good out of context.*

""Have you considered maybe proceeding without Jelim as a hostage?"" Heval ventured. Now it was my turn to look at him like he was crazy. ""I mean-""

""What?"" I snapped.

Heval sighed. ""Look, sir, sometimes you have to admit something's a lost cause."" He had clearly forgotten that doing so would probably land me in prison. ""I mean, how many times have we even tried to kill this girl?"" I started counting in my head.

Heval, being the special little man he was, counted out loud. ""Okay, so we have Cerso's hit men. That's one spectacular failure. Then we have the massacre a few days later, which was actually pretty successful, all things considered."" He paused. ""I mean, it backfired heavily on us, but it did work.""

""Cerso's men killed innocent prey."" I reminded him. ""That's not success by my metric.""

""Well, yeah, yeah, same difference. If you want to make a salad, you have to chop up some greens."" Just for the record, I kept him around because he did what I said. Not because of stuff like this. ""The point is, every time we try to kill this bitch, it blows up in our faces! Have you considered maybe trying to obtain leverage in a different kind of fashion?""

You see, this was exactly why I kept him around. He had ideas. Good ones, too. ""I can do this.""

My list of crimes was long, but nothing was unforgivable with the right incentive. I had never killed anybody, I had never even ordered someone's death, all I had done was conspire with Cerso and his ilk as a high-ranking member of his organization. That, and I did skew a few trials here and there if he wanted me to.

The exterminators had bigger problems than a corrupt judge, such as actual terrorists who actually killed people, so I was safe for now as the noose tightened in. However, I knew very well that 'for now' wouldn't last. I needed an insurance policy.

I needed one hell of a lot of insurance policies. ""Okay, let's talk hostages. Who could I kidnap that is A: important to Venlil Prime's societal growth and stability, and B: not guarded every single second by a platoon of armed guards?"" I asked.

""Uhh..."" Heval began counting on his paws, scratching his head every so often. He grabbed a writing utensil of mine and started to fidget with it, too. ""Nobody. There is not a single person you can feasibly take hostage that will even come close to earning you amnesty.""

He didn't even look uneasy that time. That caught me completely off guard. ""Also,"" he continued, ""the exterminators are going to kick down your door if you do this.""

""The whole point of this plan is to make sure that they don't kick down my door!"" I exclaimed. ""What do I have to lose?""

""It's 'what do *we* have to lose'."" said Heval. ""I'm going to be your cell-mate if this all fails, and you know damn well I'm not going to let you brahk it up.""

""Fine, fine, you're right. But the point remains that we have nothing to lose by going through with my plan. They can't execute us twice.""

Heval sighed the sigh of a teacher whose student had just told him the most dimwitted answer one could think of in ten lifetimes. I found it quite patronizing. ""I suppose you are correct, technically, I mean, but there are better ways of doing this.""

""I'm listening."" I was, indeed, listening. I was also desperate, so I'd listen to pretty much anything he had to say.

""So,"" Heval began, ""you want to take high-profile hostages because one of them is worth a hundred regular people, right?""

I flicked an affirmative. ""Yeah, something like that. More like a thousand.""

""And, if your hostage is important enough, the Venlil government will theoretically grant you amnesty.""

I flicked another affirmative. ""Yeah, more or less. What? Is there a problem?""

Heval sighed that same patronizing sigh. ""You're a dumbass. An incredible, incredible dumbass."" He looked me dead in the eyes. ""I should just cut and run now, really. But I won't.""

For the record, I appreciated his loyalty. We had a relationship built on mutual trust and respect. ""Can you... uh... un-dumbass me?"" Also for the record, I didn't usually talk in this way. When I was at my judging pulpit, yes, that was its real name, I was a much more formal person. I had a reputation to uphold, after all.

""Yes, sir."" said Heval. ""First of all, everyone worth kidnapping has security."" *Yes, yes, we went over this already! What's your point?* ""Ever since that greedy bastard Cerso committed that mass shooting, that security has doubled or even tripled. Couple that with your complete and utter lack of effective troops, and you're never kidnapping anyone.""

Most of our competent personnel were either imprisoned or dead. What little crack troops I had left were being held in reserve as a last resort force. ""Also,"" said Heval, ""I don't approve of your recruiting Predator Disease patients. They're dangerous.""

""They're trustworthy."" I shot back. ""They do what I tell them to do, and I can always hold a trip back to the facilities over them if they have qualms.""

""They're incompetent, is what they are."" Heval countered. ""Seven of them tried kidnapping one exterminator t, just one, and they all failed. She wasn't armed, she had no backup, nothing! She's just good.""

""Well,"" I chuckled, ""if they're so incompetent, then they're hardly dangerous. But please, continue.""

There were a lot of former exterminators who were in Predator Disease facilities, owing to the predatory nature of their work, but they were kept under the strictest security. Even a man with my connections could only grab a few of the low-risk patients.

I did have one man who scared the hell out of me, though. He was once a high-ranking exterminator, but he got institutionalized after he set his son on fire in a domestic dispute. He was a scumbag, yes, but so was the man I was sending him after.

Cerso used this organization for his own personal ends, and he shoved it at the proverbial and literal predators so he could make off with an absurd amount of wealth. I couldn't let that just happen. I was freeing one monster so I could put down another.

""Boss?"" Heval asked. I had zoned out for a few seconds there. ""You listening?""

""Run that by me one more time, please, I didn't get it very well.""

Heval sighed. ""Fine. Whatever. Just try and pay attention this time.""

I did. Whether or not Cerso died wasn't really important in the long run, at least not to my well-being, but I still held a healthy hatred for the bastard. Most of us Guard remnants did.

""Anyway, if one heavily-guarded person is worth a thousand unguarded people, why not just take all of them hostage?"" Now, *that* was an idea. A damned good one, too.

Except, of course, for one small problem. ""Where in all hell would I find a thousand people? And where would I find the manpower to kidnap them all?""

Heval thought for a brief moment. ""Federation Tower."" he said. ""Just the residential section alone has 600 residents. Combine that with the offices right above it, and that's 1,350 hostages all ours for the taking.""

I did the math mentally. That was a lot of hostages.

Heval continued talking. ""Security is pitiful, and the place is easily defensible once we've taken it over. We disable the elevators and lock up the stairwells, maybe post a few guards, and it'll be a fortress.""

""And the exterminators?"" I queried.

""The exterminators are in the same situation we are!"" Heval laughed. Or, at least, what we considered a laugh. A proper laugh. ""The predators are practically the only people left with competent troops to deploy, and we both know they won't bust their asses to save a few Venlil.""

""Agreed. This could go a long way toward showing the world these predators' true nature. If they elect to storm the building, despite knowing we will kill the hostages, we gain a great propaganda victory.""

Heval once again looked patronizing. Sometimes, I wasn't sure if he knew who was in charge here.

""Not for the Predator Guard."" he said. ""We'll have to rebrand somehow.""

*I'm sorry, we? We? I'm out of here.*

""There is no 'we' when it comes to the Predator Guard, Heval."" I explained. ""Once I receive a pardon for my crimes, I'll be out for good. Maybe I could retire to some town on the night side, live out life under darkness.""

""You? Pardoned?"" Heval laughed. ""You're part of the upper echelon of an organization that killed hundreds of predators! Even if the Venlil do weasel a pardon out of them, you'll just get your brains blown out by the first human who tracks you down.""

""Well, what do you suggest?"" I scoffed. ""That I go down nobly, becoming some kind of martyr for people to suicide-bomb UN tanks about?""

That wasn't such a bad idea, if I were still a loyalist to the cause. Unfortunately for it and very fortunately for me, I knew when to cut my losses and run.

""No, actually, I'm suggesting we both leave Venlil space."" Heval told me. ""I've heard Nishtal looks real nice this time of year.""

I looked at him like he had just told me the secret to finding God. He truly was a genius. ""So we include a shuttle in our demands."" I thought aloud. ""We have them fly it to the top of the tower, leave it there, and let us take off unmolested. Then all we have to do is get to Federation space.""

""I can charter us a ship under false identities. That'll help avoid being tracked."" Heval wasn't just a genius, he was a *criminal* genius. Apparently, spending enough time working for the law let you know how to dodge it.

""That sounds fine and dandy. Now, all we have to do is make sure we succeed.""

""That's... actually not easier said than done."" *Brahking finally! I've been waiting ages to hear some good brahking news!* ""The Venlil civil protection guilds, both of them, are staffed mainly with incompetent trainees. Most guild offices have even more incompetents training them."" The blind could lead the blind off a cliff. This was good for me, but outright terrible for Venlil Prime.

""I doubt the predators will respond to a threat that doesn't affect their own kind. Any response the exterminators can make will be withheld for fear of mass casualties."" The exterminators, despite their predatory name and task, were there to protect us. Even if it meant giving a man like me an escape route.

""There is, however, one issue."" Heval explained. *Oh, boy.*

""What? What issue is there?""

""The UN-Venlil joint response will be hampered by one side's indifference and the other's incompetence. The only way this won't work is if the predators care enough to act..."" That was never going to happen. ""Or the prey know how to."" That was never going to happen either.

""Most high-ranking exterminators either quit or were forced out. Same with the police."" Heval placed a datapad on the table. ""Two did not.""

I read the names on his pad. Karelim, District Supervisor. Jelim, District Commander. Both Krakotl, one a recent transfer and one a second-generation immigrant. They both had impressive records. ""Are they experienced with hostage crises?"" I queried. I already knew the answer was no.

""No, sir, but Jelim has proven herself adaptable. She's open-minded enough to develop a strategy.""

""An open mind is an unsafe one."" I quoted directly from a required-reading Federation pamphlet. ""I intend to teach her that full-well."" She had friends in the Guild. People she thought she could trust. But, as her kind said, the talon in the back hurt like ten in the front.

""Shall I handle her, sir?"" I thought about that for a moment. *Now that I think about it, you probably could.* That was it. I was done thinking now. Jelim was lethal, for lack of a better word. It came with the job. Heval, however, was also lethal.

But it wasn't worth compromising my best asset. If he failed, which our assassins tended to do a lot, then I was screwed. ""No, you won't be needed."" I reassured him. ""I'll have my informant keep her out of our way.""

""Your informant is hardly a trained spy.""

""And you're hardly a trained assassin! Plus, sabotaging her has historically had a better track record than trying to kill her."" I sighed. It felt oddly good. Now I saw why Heval did it so often. ""Look, Heval, my informant is in the perfect place to tie up her and Karelim.""

""It is not that hard to kill her!"" Heval exclaimed. ""I can break into her house with a gun, slip some of my blood in her food, take her out in a hit-and-run, there are so many ways to kill someone that you just haven't considered!""

I sighed again. This time, it felt less good. Now I was wondering why Heval hadn't stopped. ""You are my best asset. If I lose you, I'm screwed. My informant, however, is expendable. Nobody sheds tears over spies."" That was a good saying. I made it up, and even though I still didn't quite know what it meant, I knew that it was a good saying.

""If the informant fails, you call me."" Heval ordered. I didn't get why, since I was his superior, but he did it anyway. ""I can kill one Krakotl, Sevros. It's not that hard.""

I sighed for a third time. Now, it was just getting old. ""Make your preparations, Heval. I'll make mine."" My subordinate flicked an affirmative.

""This can go so horribly wrong in so many ways."" *We've been over this, Heval. There's no other choice.*

""But if it all goes right,"" I reassured him, ""then we get to relax and sip algal blooms on the streets of Kiltra Tamis.""

Scientists named the new species Syllipsimopodi bideni and argued that it was the extinct ancestor of all modern octopuses, which all eventually lost 2 arms. But was it really a new species?","https://preview.redd.it/6kvu7k4psl8c1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=684f27598f230c73b0a6d686c9b2521fc7dcd09a

328 million years ago, Montana was an unfamiliar place. Where there are now snow-capped mountains and rolling plains, there were once deep marine bays and torrential summer monsoons. Its tropical waters teemed with life, much of it quite exotic to our eyes. One day, a violent summer storm ejected undersea sediment up into the water, feeding an enormous algal bloom with organic nutrients. The algae sucked the oxygen out of the water, suffocating countless undersea creatures. Among them was our 10-armed organism, which sank to the bottom and was buried.

In 1988, paleontologists unearthed the creature's fossil at [Bear Gulch Limestone](https://sciencepress.mnhn.fr/sites/default/files/articles/pdf/g2002n2a2.pdf) in Montana. The fossil was donated to the Royal Ontario Museum that year, but no one noticed its importance and it sat forgotten in storage for decades until it was pulled out of a drawer by [Christopher Whalen](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/08/science/vampire-squid-biden.html), a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History. He looked at it more closely than anyone had before. For an invertebrate with no bones and only watery soft tissue, the specimen was remarkably well-preserved. Under a microscope, he saw suckers along all 10 arms.

What Whalen initially thought was just an ordinary cephalopod turned out to be a new species. His discovery was published in [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28333-5) in March 2022. As reported by [*Smithsonian Magazine*](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/ancient-10-armed-octopus-relative-named-for-joe-biden-180979698/):

>The discovery of *Syllipsimopodi bideni*, which lived around 328 million years ago, means these soft-bodied creatures appeared in the ocean far sooner than previously thought. It pushes back the fossil record of the vampyropods, the group of cephalopods containing octopus and vampire squid, by almost 82 million years.  
>  
>The fossil also suggests that the cephalopod ancestor may have originally had ten limbs, before evolving into modern eight-limbed octopuses and squids. The work was published Tuesday in the journal *Nature Communications*.  
>  
>‚ÄúThis is the first and only known vampyropod to possess ten functional appendages,‚Äù study author Christopher Whalen, a paleontologist at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York, says in a statement. ‚ÄúSo this fossil is arguably the first confirmation of the idea that all cephalopods ancestrally possessed ten arms.""  
>  
>The creature has a roughly five-inch-long body similar to those of modern squids, but instead of eight arms and two tentacles, all of *S. bideni*'s limbs are arms, as they have suckers along their entire length. Two of its arms seem to be longer than the other eight, and scientists also found remnants of its ink sac.

# Was it really a new species?

Paleontology is tough. Scientists have to decipher clues about complex organisms which died out millions of years ago, based on visual features in fossils which can be subjective. The discovery of *S. bideni* rests on the presence of a gladius, a shell-like internal feature named after a Roman sword of the same shape. On that point, [*Science News*](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/fossil-octopus-cephalopod-ancestor-10-arms-debate-identity) reported:

>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the gladius, I‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù says Christian Klug, a cephalopod paleontologist at the University of Zurich. He argues that the slender lines are actually evidence of a flattened phragmocone, the series of chambers found in the shells of early cephalopods. And if there‚Äôs no gladius, as Klug suggests, the fossil would not be a vampyropod after all.  
>  
>Different interpretations of fossils are not uncommon in paleontology. A famous example is *Tullimonstrum*, more commonly known as the Tully monster. First discovered in 1955, paleontologists still disagree about whether it‚Äôs a vertebrate.  
>  
>‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all looking at the same fossils and the same features,‚Äù says Roy Plotnick, an invertebrate paleontologist at the University of Illinois Chicago. But something as simple as orientation can affect the interpretation of a fossil. Plotnick is working on a study about a fossil that was classified as a jellyfish for almost 50 years; upon flipping it upside down, he realized it‚Äôs actually a sea anemone.

On December 7, 2023, Klug published [a response article in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42842-x) where he argued that the fossil is from the known extinct cephalopod *Gordoniconus beargulchensis*. This species is not ancestral to octopuses. *G. beargulchensis* was also found at Bear Gulch, Montana and is of the same age, size, and proportions; differences between the specimen might only be due to the condition of the fossil. On December 12, 2023, Whalen & Landen published [another response in *Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42843-w) reaffirming that the fossil shows a new species. They emphasized that the fossil shows suckers, which has not been found in *G. beargulchensis* specimen. There is good reason to think *G. beargulchensis* did not have suckers‚Äîthis is a time long before suckers were thought to have even evolved.

*Syllipsimopodi bideni* translates in Greek to ""Biden's prehensile foot."" Our creature had no feet, but its arms and suckers were probably helpful in allowing it to grab prey. *S. bideni* might have used its arms to crack open shells and feast on the flesh inside. It may have been the first in a long lineage of species that had discovered an inventive way to eat.",26 Dec 2023 04:20:49,reddit

## Minnesota Aims to Shrink Pay Gaps with New Legislation üí∞

**The Summary:** The Preventing Pay Discrimination Act, effective Jan.1, seeks to [narrow gender and racial pay gaps](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/thats-unacceptable-and-thats-real-money-minnesotas-new-pay-gap-law-to-go-into-effect-jan-1/?utm_source=www.tcinsider.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=12-25-2023-warm-weather-records-pay-gap-legislation-vikings-struggle) by promoting pay based on an applicant's skills and prohibiting employers from inquiring about past or current pay during the hiring process.

**Current Pay Gaps:** Minnesota women face an average lifetime earnings loss of $447,960 due to the gender wage gap, and the disparity is even more significant for women of color and Native American women,[ according to a recent report](https://www.wfmn.org/research/status-of-women-and-girls-in-minnesota/?utm_source=www.tcinsider.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=12-25-2023-warm-weather-records-pay-gap-legislation-vikings-struggle) from the University of Minnesota's Humphrey School of Public Affairs.

**Legislation Precedent:** Eighteen other states have already enacted legislation that bars employers for requesting a job candidate‚Äôs pay history.

**The Penalty:** Businesses that are found to not be in compliance with the law will be forced to pay a civil penalty and compensatory damages up to $25,000.

**Pushback:** [The legislation is facing opposition](https://www.startribune.com/new-minnesota-law-will-ban-employers-from-asking-a-job-candidates-salary-history/600329997/?utm_source=www.tcinsider.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=12-25-2023-warm-weather-records-pay-gap-legislation-vikings-struggle) from certain business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, who acknowledged the law's good intentions but criticized its steep penalties and views it as an additional burden faced by small businesses amid numerous state and federal requirements.

https://imgur.com/a/3hmPZmV 

Long story: I started a new freshwater (filtered tap water) tank about six months ago, added some cherry shrimp. Three shrimp became berried about three weeks ago. I had a couple Amano shrimp in there, but one of them was growing huge and devouring everything and also bullying the rest of my shrimp, including the berried ones. I moved the Amano to a different tank (like 1.5 wks ago). Then four days later, I randomly had an huge amount of algae that grew quickly. Then I added the same Amano back into my tank to eat all the new algae. Then I had a clown killifish that jumped out of the tank three days after the algal bloom (he died), but otherwise no changes. Today I found a bunch of little white moving dots along the front of the tank and I put them under a microscope. What are they, and are they harmful for my to-be hatched baby shrimp? 

I tested the tank parameters and ammonia levels are 0-0.25 ppm (which it has been for the past many months). I added Dr Tim‚Äôs Aquatics live nitrifying bacteria just in case about five days ago.

I fed a whole bunch of Shrimp Cuisine that the shrimp missed just a few days before the algal bloom so I think that was the reason for that. I had never added that much before, but I didn‚Äôt want my momma shrimp to be hungry when I was going to be out for four days. I think it was too much and I won‚Äôt do that again. 

Should I go on a massive killing spree? Should I dump Panacur into the water? I don‚Äôt really know how to proceed, anything helps! And if you happen to know what worm this is and then link a credible source to research it, I would be over-the-moon ecstatic.",19 Dec 2023 23:57:05,reddit
407,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18lq3s9,Take two,"I'm embarrassed to say i lost my first betta after a measly two weeks and I'm still trying to figure out what went wrong... I went to my LFS and got a female plakat galaxy koi (last pic) after marinating my 10 gallon planted aquarium for 2 weeks. I did get an algal bloom along with elevated nitrites (api master kit) so ended up having to do daily 25% water changes until the nitrites dropped to 0, so I'm thinking i added her too soon. She still behaved normally for another week (2 pellets 2x per day) then started developing the vertical hang and worsening swim bladder problems before expiring last night.

I'm thinking either she got hit by a nitrite/ammonia spike on the tail end of cycling (since i added her after 2 weeks and didn't test till a week after adding her. So she was more or less fish in cycle) or some food obstructed her belly.

Meanwhile, the 4 corydoras i added a week before her have done superbly (although I've kept fish years ago with my dad and corys in my experience are among the most bulletproof along with zebra danios).

Anyways, it's probably a bit soon but went and got a regular female veiltail today (2nd pic) from the big box store because I'm not spending 5x the amount at the LFS until i know my parameters are conducive for this genus.

Bottom line is i tried to do everything right (plakat female from LFS, tonnes of plants, 10 gallon tank, daily water change when i realized i was still not quite cycled) and ended up killing a beginner fish in a record shattering 2 weeks.

I guess the only other major thing is this is a walstad so perhaps the water column had a high amount of nutrients.

I'm just frustrated because this isn't my first time taking care of fish so i know the basics and i thought bettas were hardy... certainly a plakat female. And yet she died faster than ones sitting in a cup of their own filth.

Dr John Barry says Minister Andrew Muir should alert British and Irish governments and demand help     

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today at 06:35

The money allocated by Stormont to address ecological problems on Lough Neagh ‚Äúwill not touch the sides‚Äù of what is needed, an environmental academic has said.

Last year the Lough was besieged by blooms of blue-green algae, causing vast swathes of thick green substances on its surface.

The crisis resulted from the perfect storm of higher temperatures, prolonged periods of rain and higher nutrient content in the water due to agricultural run-off.

Environment Minister Andrew Muir told the Assembly on Monday that ¬£1.6m had been allocated by the Executive to his department in capital funding and no resource funding for the issues besetting the lough, with officials now looking at other ways to fund the work needed.

Mr Muir said the allocation given to his department was ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù.

He added: ‚ÄúWe need to invest in turning the situation round in Lough Neagh.‚Äù

The minister also told the Assembly he had commissioned scientific research to assess the effect of removing sand from the lough.

Dr John Barry, Professor of Green Political Economy at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, said the amount allocated would not be anywhere near enough to solve the issues.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even going to touch the sides,‚Äù he told the Belfast Telegraph.

‚ÄúThe timescales ‚Äî going on the meeting Save Our Lough had with him last week ‚Äî were in terms of decades.

‚ÄúThere is an American adage ‚Äî a day late and a dollar short ‚Äî but it‚Äôs going to be decades late and a lot of money short to address this.

‚ÄúIt is disappointing; the longer we delay addressing the causes of the problems with the Lough, it‚Äôs going to take longer and cost more.‚Äù    

With warmer temperatures expected in 2024 due to the El Nino phenomenon, Dr Barry said the issues that plagued Lough Neagh last year would be even worse this year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be warmer this year, so it is probably going to be worse than it was last year,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe crisis is not caused by climate change, but climate change means the water is warmer, which causes more energy and therefore the algae blooms increase.

‚ÄúIt is a disaster and there is no sign the government is going to be taking it with any degree of seriousness. This really should be an Executive Office priority, not just for DAERA.‚Äù

Dr Barry said Mr Muir should be alerting the British and Irish governments to the scale of the problem and demanding more money.

‚ÄúI think this is such an emergency and it has been declared as such. This is 40% of our drinking water, the largest freshwater lake in these islands. It is an extraordinary situation,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt he going to the British government and Irish government and saying, ‚ÄòGive us more money‚Äô? That would be evidence that he is really taking this seriously, rather than asking his [Executive] colleagues nicely.

‚ÄúHe has now tasked his officials to go and find a bit of money down the back of a sofa and we all know how that‚Äôs going to work out ‚Äî it‚Äôs not going to be enough.

‚ÄúThis is going to run and run; it‚Äôs going to get considerably worse. We could be looking at irreparable damage to the Lough unless it‚Äôs addressed now.‚Äù    

It comes after the Assembly passed a motion calling for an ‚Äúecological and biodiversity crisis‚Äù to be declared in Northern Ireland.

The motion, tabled by the SDLP opposition, also urged DAERA to bring forward legislation to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency as outlined in the 2020 New Decade, New Approach agreement.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the passing of the motion.

‚ÄúIn the past few days with the spell of hot weather we are already seeing signs of the re-emergence of the toxic algae blooms which wreaked such havoc over the past year, killing wildlife, destroying biodiversity and impacting local businesses,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe reasons for the ecological crisis at the Lough are well-worn, but it is deeply disappointing that we stand here again on the brink of another summer where little has been done to address these issues.

‚ÄúParties have been clear on the need to act to protect the long-term future of the Lough.

‚ÄúOne of the Minister‚Äôs first visits after assuming office was to the Lough, but we need action if we are going to save this precious resource.

‚ÄúProtecting our environment should be a priority for every department and there needs to be ownership of this issue from the entire Executive.

‚ÄúThe SDLP has been calling for an independent Environmental Protection Agency for well over a decade and it was agreed as part of New Decade, New Approach.

‚ÄúWhat we have been doing up until this point clearly isn‚Äôt working and it is our view that an independent body will give us the best chance of safeguarding our natural resources like Lough Neagh.‚Äù",14 May 2024 04:55:28,reddit

I'm about at my wits end with my pool, and I'm hoping that someone will be able to help out! For reference, our pool is 13.5K gallons, salt water, and vinyl. I live in the SE, and current temps are cloudy in the 70s/80s, pool water is 70 degrees. 

Over the winter, we had some iron staining come up. We were able to easily and fully clear it using ascorbic acid followed by Jack's Magic Purple stuff about two weeks ago. The pool looked great! Trying to follow the directions on Jack's Magic, I raised the chlorine levels slowly, but I clearly went too slowly, because by the following week algae started appearing. I started the SLAM process yesterday, and the iron stains came right back.

My plan right now is to complete the SLAM, but once I do that, is there a way to get the iron stains back out without causing an algae bloom during the time that the chlorine levels are low? Any help is appreciated!",13 May 2024 10:21:28,reddit

429,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cptmeg,Amateur pond owner,"After several weeks in our new home a couple years ago we discovered a 50 gal pond buried under plants. The property was so full of potted and planted vegetation we had no idea what we had. Over 3 tons removed! Anyways, it had no filter or air, 4 koi and 20 goldfish!! I immediately set up a 125 gal pond with the works and transferred them, the water and gunk and some plants to the new pond. Ran good for 5 months until the sun cooked it and the algae ran wild and the ph started spiking to 9 and above in the afternoons. Most of the koi jumped out at night, I added shade curtains and major water changes and it finally settled down. So I then dug a bigger pond approximately 1500 gallons. Its roughly 13x8 feet, the deepest being over 3‚Äô, I used a 20x25‚Äô liner. I am in Florida and this is now under the oak canopy and gets 1.5 hours of full sun in the summer afternoons. As you see in the pic, the smaller pond drains into the larger one via small pump. i have a filter with the fountain and added plants. The small
Pond was at about 2 years old when I added the large pond so there was a lot of new water added but same filters. The new system is around 7 months old and I had a major carpet algae bloom and the water turned green. Then overnight the water cleared up and the filter clogged twice in 48 hours. All tests are perfect. Ph is right at 7. I have 3 koi left which are in the big pond with one goldie and about 6 golds left in the small pond. Did it just cycle again? Why would the water be so green the instantly clear with the only changes being much hotter air temps lately. Do you think the fountain and flow from the small pond are enough to keep it aerated? I am out of outlets outside and would
Have to run an air line from the porch for an air stone. Sorry for the long post and thank you all for reading it. Btw any idea what kind of koi these are? The survivors are about 10‚Äù and have grown at least 2‚Äù since moving to the new pond.",11 May 2024 19:00:52,reddit

432,https://www.reddit.com/r/Superhero_Ideas/comments/1cp7saq/the_botanists/,The Botanists,"**Dr. Cultivar**, mad botanist, is disappointed in the failure of his [Children of the Garden](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superhero_Ideas/comments/u2sk25/team_profile_the_children_of_the_garden/). These were completely sentient plants meant to be super-soldiers who quickly rebelled on their creator and attempted to subjugate the world. Only the swift action of the Premiers routed their plans.

But now Cultivar is planning on trying again, reasoning that there must be something missing, some unknown *X-factor* that would keep a plant-person from rebelling. And that something might be found by studying... *dissecting* if necessary... humans with plant-like super-evolutions!

He's sent his **Creepers**‚Äîmindless humanoid plants‚Äîout to kidnap four people and return them to his lab for study. They each come from different walks of life, some have already chosen to use their powers, some are trying to hide their strange abilities. They'll have to work together to escape...

**Willow**'s coworkers are always asking her why she doesn't eat on lunch breaks and why she doesn't like anyone touching her in any way. The truth is that her photosynthetic body is capable of producing every raw drug, toxin, and chemical substance produced by plants. From allergens and poisons to painkillers and psychadelics, Willow's very touch can do everything from heal to kill. She's been trying to quietly live her life as normally as possible after aging out of a foster system for super-evolved children a few years ago, but it's been hard. Willow thinks she just wants a quiet life, but she's been settling for a repressed and lonely life instead.

Mateo ""**Saguaro**"" Brown is a troublemaker. He rides with an Arizona biker gang, he hires himself out as muscle, and has a general disregard for peace and order. In addition to incredible endurance and stamina, Saguaro's arms and back are covered in cactus spines and bristles. Mateo doesn't care about anybody because he believes nobody cares about him. Not even his gang‚Äîto them he's just a spiky set of fists and good in a fight. Being kidnapped just for his body only further cements this thought. It's going to take a lot to convince him otherwise.

**Midnight Green** has been operating as a local protector at a seaside city for a while now... motivated mostly because it's one of the few ways a person like him can be accepted. Green's superevolution has made him akin to a humanoid mass of algae! This grants him complete command of body at the unicellular level. He can sink into soil and reemerge elsewhere, re-shape his body into tools and weapons, and even reattach or regenerate lost limbs. He's good at being a hero, he likes the feeling of respect, but he can't help but feel like there's something more.

**Banyan** hails from New Orleans, and possesses a super-evolution giving him great strength and supremely durable bark-like skin! He's a bit of a minor celebrity in the Big Easy, operating as a street-level hero and keeping his section of the Bywater district safe. Kind and tough, intimidating and safe, Banyan is probably the chillest dude you'd ever meet. If anybody can rally together this group, it's the patient empathetic ear of Banyan.

**Flower Power** is a woman who allowed Cultivar to experiment on her to be as beautiful as the flowers she so loved... and has been coerced into assisting him to pay off her incredible debt. Literal flowers bloom all over her body, producing pheromones that she can use to command and control insects! Flower has made a lot of bad choices in her life, this is another one, and even though she's not happy about being a party to these kidnappings she doesn't see another way out.

Cultivar has a stronghold and army of creepers at his disposal. Will this disparate group be able to come together and escape? Will they be able to best his new crop of Garden super-soldiers? And if they get through this alive, what next?",10 May 2024 23:12:50,reddit

When we moved into our house, the previous owners gave us a lot of great advice about how to take care of the pool but never once did they mention changing the sand in the filter to my recollection. In fact, I really only thought about it last year. In the research I did, it made sense to change it out (I get how rocks become smooth with constant water flow).

So I went to my local pool store to buy new sand and asked them how often they recommend changing the sand out. They said every 2 to 3 years! Mine is at least 11 years old and I have had little to no issues with pool balance/cleanliness over that time (one algae bloom that was easily taken care of). We run our pump 24/7 from May-Oct as well.

Did we just get lucky, or are the pool stores being unreasonable and how often to change the sand?

Tank is 40 gallon, substrate is MTS capped with sand. Followed MTS protocol adding red clay to soil and dolomite and potash to bottom of tank before layers of substrate. I seeded the tank with fliter media (sponge and bag of matrix) from established tank, placed them next to the two medium aquarium coop sponge filters that I'm using. Had a bacterial bloom as expected on day 2 which clouded the water but cleared up in a day or two and was followed by slime. I've been trying to go with the flow and let it simmer and do it's thing.  Now I have algae, which I can't identify but perhaps is staghorn? Been gradually increasing light intensity and duration; did 4 hours on, 4 hours off, then 4 hours on again for about the past week, but switched to only 4 hours on at 80% intensity as of yesterday due to concern about algae growth. Light is aquarium coop. Obvioulsy the water is quite brown from the spider wood, but I don't mind that. 

I have only done one about 20% water change so far, have read conflicting advice on water changes in new tanks.  Ammonia, nitrites and nitrates have tested at 0 twice, which I'm a little confused about lack of nitrates. My research on planted tanks seemed to indicate that ammonia dosing and ghost feeding isn't really needed to cylce a planted tank. I ghost fed this morning and will retest parameters tomorrow, as I have a mystery snail in the mail and a lone guppy from previous tank (poor thing!) that I would like to add, and I feel like it will be ok so long as I closely monitor water parameters and feed lightly? All my dwarf sag and vesuvius have new growth; the vallisneria and tiger lotus bulb arrived in rough shape and I don't think will make it and I have ordered replacements; the anubias and buce seem fine.  I have a tiny piece of frog bit that is slowly growing; it struggled in my other tank (I think due to flow). I plan to add a school of WCM once I feel like the tank can handle it, which I realize is not now, and then corydoras way down the line. 

Should I be concerned about the alage or just let it run its course? Other thoughts and advice? Thanks for reading, sorry it is long and my pictures suck due to my reflection :-)

I've tried suggestions like tapping on the same spot every feed time but he doesn't seem to get it after months. Right now the only way I can get him to see his food is if I make it RAIN in there until he sees it. It's caused really thick and fast algae blooms, plus I think killing the live plants? (Or he's eating the plants bc he thinks I'm not feeding him?) 

Right now the only unoccupied tank I have is 3 gallons. I know that's technically too small for bettas but I've read some other posts that suggest it might be okay if they're special needs. I think less space would make it easier for him to see his food, therefore I wouldn't have to throw as much in. The tank might still end up needing to be cleaned as much as the big one but it would be much easier to clean at least

Trying to get back into the hobby. In college I gave the reef tank a few goes but never had a lot of success. I would make it to the ugly phase and algae would blow up the tank. I was probably moving too fast and overloading things. (I also love the nano look but know its much harder to maintain than a more forgiving larger tank.)

  
Now that I have a little bit more patience/cash I can move at a different pace. I was hoping to get some advice  
on the following:

A good starter tank, trying to keep it around 13-40Gal due to size constraints in my apartment.

What light is best for softies (I really want a smart one that has an app that keeps the algae from blooming  
due to over lighting or too high power for too long). Something that has lower maintenance is best.

What testers, auto top offs, and other little items do you use to help maintenance feel more manageable.

How to best cycle the tank and solid timelines to follow before adding soft corals and fish.

Basically, what would you do if you were trying to get back into the hobby and was giving yourself  
advice. 

My budget is around $600 but would prefer to stay on the lower end if possible. 

My goal is a clean looking tank with zoanthids and other easy softies.

Contrary to the Federation‚Äôs dogma, predators are not stealthy or deceptive. In actuality, they‚Äôre quite easy to track. They don‚Äôt erase their footprints; they leave fur or feathers everywhere, and they don't make any effort to mask their scent. If those methods of finding them fail, you can always set one of their dens on fire. The mewling calls of the little ones inside will draw the parents into the open, where they‚Äôre much easier to exterminate.¬†

Arxur are similarly easy to stalk, not because of their simple-mindedness‚Äìlike their nonsapient ilk‚Äìbut due to their arrogance. Every one of them, even the skinny and maltreated lower ranks, thinks of themselves as superior in every way to their prey. Thus, they don‚Äôt temper themselves. They move loudly, talk flagrantly, and don‚Äôt pay very much attention to their surroundings. Arxur commanders are especially easy to identify, they love shouting orders at the top of their lungs and abusing their subordinates.¬†

At several points during my career, me and my exterminators have followed arxur for \[kilometers\] and fell upon them when they dropped their guard. If you are out of sight and downwind, you might as well be intangible to them.

I didn‚Äôt have to use any of my previous knowledge to find Isaac. He was screaming and cursing so loudly that I could hear him through the forest‚Äôs canopy, even with the wind rushing past my ears. I used the noise as a beacon to glide high and fast in his approximate direction.

I should have trained my eyes on the ground, but the vast landscape that stretched out before me naturally drew them. Trees sheltered the ground all the way to the horizon, occasionally broken up by a road, river, or quaint little dwelling. Some retained their verdant colors; others were turning fiery red, warm shades of orange, or yellow as the seasons changed. It wasn‚Äôt too different from the algae blooms that occasionally turned Nishtal‚Äôs brackish waters into a canvas of swirling, ever-changing color. The life I led had brought me to dozens of planets, possibly hundreds. All of them were beautiful in their own way.

Another string of expletives exploded from the forest floor. This time, it seemed to be coming from directly below me. I tipped my wings and spiraled downward until I met a branch that was sturdy enough to support my weight.

I listened closely and detected leaves rustling beneath me, accompanied by heavy, panting breaths. I peered through the crisscrossing tree limbs and spotted movement on the forest floor. I hopped and fluttered from branch to branch in pursuit of it, only stopping once I had an unobstructed view of Isaac.¬†

He stopped his advance not far from a river I caught sight of while in the air. He paced back and forth like a cornered animal, agitation growing with every step until he tore the helmet off his head and threw it against an evergreen, producing a crack that echoed across the river. He stomped up to the same tree and beat it with his fists until the energy and rage drained from his body. He collapsed with his back resting against the trunk, whipped the padded gloves off his hands, and ran his fingers through the short fur on his head. I couldn‚Äôt see Isaac‚Äôs face, but the shaky breaths that met my ears made it obvious that he was crying.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt equipped for handling such an emotional situation, so I remained on my perch for several \[minutes\] until the Lieutenant steadied himself enough to close his eyes and rested his head against the bark behind him.¬†

I silently glided to Isaac‚Äôs tree and stepped down the limbs until I was just \[2 meters\] above his head. Then, I let myself fall forward while maintaining my grip on the branch below me. I ended up hanging upside down by my feet. The action was completely silent, save for the faint scraping of my talons against the bark. It didn‚Äôt draw the Lieutenant's attention, so I whistled to him.

Isaac quickly opened his eyes and scanned the forest around him.

‚ÄúUp here, Lieutenant.‚Äù

His eyes tracked upward. ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, old man?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust hanging out, as you humans say.‚Äù I clacked my beak together twice to punctuate the joke.

My pitiful attempt at injecting levity bore fruit. For the briefest moment, the corners of Isaac‚Äôs mouth twitched upward into a smile, but he suppressed it just as quickly as it appeared and stared at the ground between his legs.¬†

I snapped my beak to get his attention. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no point in brooding! Get up!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd do what, old man?! I just assaulted one of my soldiers!‚Äù he shouted back.

‚ÄúYou avoided being arrested once. With a little thinking, you can do it again, unless you want to swim across that river and disappear into the woods forever.‚Äù

His gaze shifted to the sandbar on the other side of the waterway.

‚ÄúThat was also a joke. I won‚Äôt let you do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're not very funny,‚Äù he said morosely.

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm hysterical, but that might be due to the blood rushing to my head. Would you kindly catch me?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúCatch me!‚Äù I let go of the branch and landed softly in Isaac‚Äôs arms rather than on the hard, unforgiving ground. I rolled out of his embrace and stood on my own two feet. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

After an awkward pause, Isaac stood as well. He gathered up the training gear he had scattered around during his breakdown and looked at me expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúLead the way, Lieutenant. You know the terrestrial route better than me.‚Äù¬†

Isaac sighed and hesitantly set off through the trees.

‚ÄúHow are you planning to get out of this one?‚Äù I asked as I walked alongside him.

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù he said with his gaze set firmly forward.

‚ÄúThe Colonel is quite xenophobic. It could be useful to appeal to that bias.‚Äù

Isaac glared down at me.

‚ÄúIt was just a suggestion. If you are unable or unwilling to do such a thing, it would be no problem for me. In fact, I find being racist rather easy.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes and looked forward again, falling silent as he pondered what to do next. The forest was all I could hear‚Äìtrees rustling, other avian creatures whistling, and leaves crunching under our feet‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNot to interrupt your thinking, but how did you get so good at bayonet fighting?‚Äù

Isaac chuckled to himself. ‚ÄúIn my old unit, we alleviated our boredom by making pugil sticks out of whatever we could find and beating the crap out of each other.

‚ÄúYou beat each other regularly for amusement? Humans truly are savages!‚Äù I exclaimed sarcastically.

Another eye roll. ‚ÄúNo one ever got seriously hurt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not very reassuring. Care to explain why you‚Äôre serving with us instead of these men?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Lieutenant said with a finality that signaled the end of our conversation.¬†

My question was admittedly brazen, but it's best to take the most direct route first when looking for an answer. If I had to pry further to learn more about Isaac and hopefully understand his extreme bouts of fear and anger, then so be it. I was up to such a challenge.

As we crossed the forest‚Äôs threshold back into civilization, all eyes were on us. The Platoon Sergeant's gaze was particularly disdainful, but the most important set of eyes were those of the Colonel and the Captain. Rainach directed a menacing stare at us while Andrews looked directly forward and tried to project a calm image of herself. But her wringing hands portrayed her anxiety.

The sergeants had organized four separate sparring matches while we were away. The participants, both human and alien, were making slow and half-hearted jabs at each other. The officers‚Äô encouragement, which came in the form of shouting, wasn‚Äôt having any effect. It would seem that the Lieutenant's outburst put a damper on everyone‚Äôs spirits.

Isaac dropped the gear he carried in a pile and called them to attention. ‚ÄúTwo people in this group will be able to go to bed two hours early; whichever alien wins the most matches, and whichever human wins the most. I‚Äôll let you decide who it‚Äôs going to be.‚Äù

The competitors eyed each other with equal parts suspicion and determination. A gojid broke the tension by tackling his sparring partner to the ground and plunging the red side of his pugil stick into the human‚Äôs stomach. The Russians that surrounded them cheered, and the sparring matches started up again with much more enthusiastic participants this time.

If I had to make one compliment to the Lieutenant, he had a talent for motivating people. The opportunity to earn extra sleep, combined with chronic sleep deprivation, could turn soulmates into the bitterest of rivals.

Isaac surveyed his men and allowed himself a small smile before trudging toward his superiors the same way a PD patient does on the way to electroshock therapy. Nedelin positioned himself within earshot of the conversation while keeping his eyes on the sparring match he was monitoring.

‚ÄúCare to explain what the fuck is going on here, Lieutenant?‚Äù Rainach spat.

Andrews gave Isaac a pleading look, trying to prevent him from saying anything unwise.¬†

Isaac‚Äôs response was astonishingly evasive. ‚ÄúJust a training incident, sir,‚Äù

He pointed at Kaero. ‚ÄúYou mean to tell me that was an accident?‚Äù One of her eyes had swollen shut, and green blood trickled from her nose. Daego was shining a light in her other eye, much to her annoyance.

‚ÄúIncident, not accident. Sometimes we need to remind the xenos of their place; you know how it is,‚Äù Isaac said with a forced smile.

Rainach was silent for a moment before he broke into a snarl as well. ‚ÄúLieutenant, that is the biggest load of bullshit I‚Äôve ever heard in my life.‚Äù

Isaac‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúSir?‚Äù

‚ÄúI already know you‚Äôre a xeno-fucker. You put them in thigh-highs for God‚Äôs sake.‚Äù

Isaac‚Äôs face twisted like he wanted to burst out laughing and scream with frustration at the same time. At the edge of my peripheral vision, I spotted Nedelin trying and failing to hide a snicker.

‚ÄúNonetheless,‚Äù I interjected, ‚Äúthis problem is that yotul‚Äôs making. The Lieutenant was taking disciplinary action.‚Äù

The Colonel glared at me. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see if that primitive says the same thing. Medic, get your ass over here!‚Äù

Kaero tried to shoo her sister away, but Daego signaled her stubborn refusal to leave with her ears. The older sister huffed and made her way over while the younger of the two waited.

‚ÄúWhat-‚Äù The yotul began at an unusually high pitch. She plugged one of her nostrils, ejected a clot of green blood out of the other, and started again with her voice back to normal. ‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù

The Colonel‚Äôs face twisted with disgust. ‚ÄúExplain what led up to your incident with Lieutenant Yankovic.‚Äù

She wiped the remaining blood off her nose with the back of her paw. ‚ÄúMe and him had a disagreement and decided to settle it in the ring.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did that escalate?‚Äù

‚ÄúI may have dropped-kicked him,‚Äù she replied indifferently.

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs when it turned into a fistfight?

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you agree that you were the one who escalated?‚Äù

Kaero‚Äôs eyes flicked to her Lieutenant for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd say it was a mutual effort‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs most responsible.‚Äù

Rainach turned to Isaac. ‚ÄúTell you what, Lieutenant‚Äìsince your bird wasn‚Äôt lying‚ÄìI‚Äôll go easy on you. You, your advisor, and your Platoon Sergeant are going to an anger management program tomorrow morning to improve your conflict resolution skills. Any further discipline is up to your Captain‚Äôs discretion.‚Äù

Isaac froze in place, save for his jaw. It twitched and made a series of unintelligible syllables before suddenly snapping shut and falling silent.

I used his dumbfoundedness as an opportunity to air my grievances about Rainach‚Äôs decisions. ‚ÄúWhy am I being punished?! Or the Platoon Sergeant, for that matter?! Me and him had nothing to do‚Äì‚Äù

Isaac suddenly seized my beak and held it shut. I struggled and tried to pull myself out of his grip, but it just caused him to squeeze tighter. He spoke in a low growl through his teeth. ‚ÄúShut the fuck up, old man.‚Äù

Turning my claws on him wasn‚Äôt worth the consequences, which would likely involve him snapping my neck, so I huffed through my nostrils to show my disapproval and didn‚Äôt make any further efforts to escape.¬†

‚ÄúSir, we have a ruck march early tomorrow,‚Äù Isaac said while clearly suppressing the urge to strangle either me or the Colonel. ‚ÄúCould we go to anger management on another day?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôd want this issue dealt with as soon as possible,‚Äù Rainach said with a sadistic smile.

‚ÄúUnderstood, sir,‚Äù Isaac said with an eye twitch.

With that, the Colonel took his leave of us and started making his way back to his vehicle. As we watched him leave, Isaac‚Äôs grip relaxed, allowing me to open my mouth slightly and snake my tongue through the notch in my beak.

Andrews only let out her breath once the Colonel and his driver were well out of view. ‚ÄúRaksim, thank you for bringing him‚Äì‚Äù She stopped mid-sentence and raised an eyebrow at my tongue hanging halfway out of my mouth.

Her reaction drew Isaac's attention, and I looked him right in the eye as I ran my tongue over his knuckles.

‚ÄúYou fucking cretin!‚Äù He shoved my head away from him and wiped the back of his hand on his thigh.

I let out a hiss and shook my wings in a taunting gesture. ‚ÄúYou have no right to silence me!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but the Colonel was giving me an out. And I wasn‚Äôt going to let you fuck it up and get me arrested!‚Äù

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do that! Do you really think so little of me?‚Äù

He was silent for a conspicuously long amount of time.

‚ÄúYankovic!‚Äù Andrews shouted and earned our attention. She glared at Isaac and drew in a breath to begin her reprimand, but he raised a finger, and the words lodged in her throat.

The Lieutenant turned to Kaero. ‚ÄúWhy did you do that?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù the yotul asked.

‚ÄúCover for me! You should have told him it was my fault!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Like I said, it was a mutual effort. And he called me a primitive, so I wasn't going to give him the satisfaction of arresting you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI called you a xeno!‚Äù

‚ÄúI find primitive more offensive.‚Äù

Daego sauntered up to us without a word. She snapped her fingers at her sister and pointed at her swollen eye.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Kaero said dismissively.

Daego huffed. ‚ÄúYes, you're the big, tough older sister. Now just let me do my job.‚Äù¬†

Kaero pried the swollen eye open, revealing a sclera tainted with green blood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine! It‚Äôs just swelling and a subconjunctival hemorrhage.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your orbital bone I‚Äôm worried about, not your eye.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not broken, see?‚Äù Kaero rolled the injured organ around in its socket.

‚ÄúYou may need a second opinion.‚Äù

Andrews tried to cut in. ‚ÄúYankovic, I need to‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Kaero,‚Äù Isaac said over her.

The yotul‚Äôs ears flicked with annoyance, and she stood with her arms folded. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt accept your apology, sir.‚Äù

He sighed. ‚ÄúThat's understandable, but I‚Äôd like to know what caused your issue with me in the first place.‚Äù

She only spoke after a moment of tense silence. ‚ÄúI hate seeing people hurt. It‚Äôs why I became a medic.‚Äù Her head suddenly snapped to face her sister. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not broken, but it still hurts when you poke at it!‚Äù

‚ÄúBe quiet. I‚Äôm almost finished,‚Äù Daego retorted while turning Kaero‚Äôs face away from her again. She talked to the Lieutenant as she worked. ‚ÄúWe grew up during Leirn‚Äôs occupation and saw firsthand what the Federation does to people when they don‚Äôt fall in line. We didn‚Äôt like it to say the least.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut we especially didn‚Äôt like it when our people stood by and watched others hurt,‚Äù the older sister said while looking right at Isaac with her uninjured eye.

Isaac had difficulty meeting her gaze. ‚ÄúI understand why you‚Äôre upset with me now. Once again, I‚Äôm sorry, and you don‚Äôt have to accept my apology.‚Äù

The yotul's ear flicked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for drop-kicking you.‚Äù

‚ÄúApology accepted.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsaac!‚Äù Andrews shouted.

He jumped on the opportunity to leave the difficult conversation. ‚ÄúYes, Captain?‚Äù He asked with a friendly smile.

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt I leave you unsupervised for ten minutes?!‚Äù I‚Äôm already stressed enough managing two other platoons on top of your merry band of misfits! I just want one day where I don‚Äôt have to worry about your soldiers needing something ridiculous, or you causing problems, or you and Raksim fighting like children! Can I have peace for one day, please?! One day is all I ask for!‚Äù By the time her rant ended, she was panting and tugging at her own hair.

‚ÄúDo you feel better now?‚Äù Isaac asked.

She sucked in a breath through her nose and released it from her mouth. ‚ÄúYes, sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs my punishment going to be?‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt decided yet.‚Äù

Kaero‚Äôs tail began wagging. ‚ÄúI have an idea, ma‚Äôam. Four hundred forty push-ups‚Äìdouble what he made me and my sister do.‚Äù

The Captain pondered for a moment before breaking into a snarl. ‚ÄúI like the way you think.‚Äù She addressed Isaac with a stern voice. ‚ÄúDrop and start counting. Medic, make sure he does all of them. And if he stops, he has to do all of them over again.‚Äù

Isaac accepted his fate with a sigh, dropped to the ground, and started counting out loud.

He was close to fifty when a truck came rumbling down the dirt road to the range and came to a stop near us. Vil thanked her Russian chauffeur and unloaded at the same time as him. She rounded the vehicle's front and stopped in her tracks once she saw the Lieutenant doing push-ups and Kaero‚Äôs swollen eye. ‚ÄúWhat did I miss?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure someone will fill you in,‚Äù Andrews answered. ‚ÄúGo rejoin your unit.‚Äù

Vil replied with a reluctant ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam‚Äù before taking one last concerned look and slinking away.

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù I whispered discreetly, ‚Äúwe need to speak in private.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she said in an affable tone. She led me to the other side of the truck Vil returned in, where her friendly demeanor quickly disappeared. ‚ÄúThis is about Yankovic,‚Äù she stated matter-of-factly.

‚ÄúHow astute of you. I understand you two had a previous relationship.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm going to discuss with you,‚Äù she said coldly.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care about any troubles you had,‚Äù I growled. ‚ÄúI want to know if he‚Äôs had any outbursts like this before.‚Äù

She said nothing as she contemplated.

‚ÄúYou have an obligation to answer. He‚Äôs been a danger to his subordinates twice now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He wasn‚Äôt ever violent when we were together.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo this is new behavior. But what caused him to change?‚Äù I mused aloud.

‚ÄúDo you know what happened to his old unit?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. The UN gave us documents on all the soldiers under us, but not each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was in New York during the bombings.‚Äù

I turned both my eyes to face her.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the only one in his platoon that survived. They were‚Ä¶ more close-knit than most units.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs the case, he shouldn‚Äôt be leading anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd rather he be in a PD facility?‚Äù She asked in an accusatory manner.

And I returned her accusation with a hiss. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what happens to people when they lose everything‚Äìdozens of times, after arxur raids. He should be getting help, not the constant bombardment of stress that running this disaster of a platoon causes.‚Äù

She let out a beleaguered sigh. ‚ÄúI know, but he‚Äôs never had a job outside the military, and I‚Äôm afraid he‚Äôll‚Ä¶ hurt himself if he‚Äôs discharged for being mentally unwell.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think that‚Äôs a strong possibility?‚Äù

She nodded.

‚ÄúWould seeing one of your ‚Äòpsychologists‚Äô help him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe booked Vil into all the available time slots.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo he‚Äôs self-sabotaging.‚Äù I drummed my talons on my beak. ‚ÄúIf he won‚Äôt help himself, then we need to help him. And, in order to do that, I need to know more about him.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou need to ask him yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe both know that he won‚Äôt yield any answers, especially to me.‚Äù¬†

Andrews didn‚Äôt speak for a moment. ‚ÄúNo, I can't. He‚Äôs still my friend, and I won‚Äôt talk about him behind his back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre letting your personal relationships cloud your judgment. If he has another blowup, it will be your fault.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be.‚Äù I turned my back to her and walked to the other side of the truck. She only followed after a few \[seconds\] of what I presumed to be contemplation.

Isaac was on 237 pushups now. His arms were shaking, he struggled for every breath, and sweat soaked his hair. Kaero and Daego were watching and enjoying every moment of his suffering, occasionally stepping on his calves to give him more resistance and make his punishment even worse.

Despite the disagreements I had with the Lieutenant, I couldn‚Äôt entertain myself with his agony for very long. I attempted to have a casual conversation, after having so many that day that were tense or irksome. ‚ÄúThat was quite an interesting style you had in your first sparring match.‚Äù I said to the older of the two yotul. ‚ÄúSome variant of combat dancing, I presume?‚Äù

Both of their ears perked up. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Kaero answered. ‚ÄúHow did you know that?‚Äù

‚ÄúI made a lot of yotul into exterminators, and I learned plenty about your culture when doing so.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean indoctrinated them,‚Äù Daego interrupted, severely reducing any chance this exchange had of being cordial.

‚ÄúYes, that‚Äôs part of their training,‚Äù I replied nonchalantly in an attempt to brush past what she said. ‚ÄúYour form isn‚Äôt one I recognize. Judging by your names, that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre Islanders.‚Äù

Kaero cocked her head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Not a lot of people in the Federation take the time to learn about us.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou may be primitives,‚Äù both of them glared at me, ‚Äúbut your culture is certainly interesting, mostly because everything in the Federation is so homogenized. But it isn‚Äôt my favorite thing about your species; that would be how useful you people are. Give a yotul any task, and they will rise to it just to spite those who think them inferior, whether it be exterminating, some kind of mechanical work, or becoming medical professionals such as yourselves.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù Kaero said halfheartedly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to know we‚Äôre useful.‚Äù

A sharp whistle suddenly cut through the air, calling everyone‚Äôs attention to Nedelin. ‚ÄúWe are switching tasks now, everyone! Listen to your sergeants!‚Äù

The drill sergeants showed their acknowledgement with a nod, and the Russian sergeant in charge of the firing range responded to Nedelin‚Äôs order by holding two thumbs up in the air.

‚ÄúTry not to cause any more trouble, idiot,‚Äù Daego said while drawing her sister into a hug.

Kaero returned the embrace. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt make any promises.‚Äù

The younger sister‚Äôs tail wagged. ‚ÄúI know, but I‚Äôll always be there to fix you up.‚Äù And with that, she rejoined the half of the platoon that was at the gun range.

The drill sergeants halted any sparring matches that were still in motion while one of them barked out orders. ‚ÄúTake off any training gear you might be wearing, collect your weapons, and line up for inspection! Put your bayonets back in their scabbards and keep them there for the rest of the day!‚Äù

After a quick tally, Grigoryev was determined to be one of the winners of the Lieutenant's contest. The victor‚Äôs position for the aliens, however, was a three-way tie and they weren‚Äôt brave enough to ask for his solution while he was being punished.¬†

At the gun range, the Russian sergeant ordered the soldiers under him to unload their weapons and personally checked to make sure they had done so. Then, he pulled them far behind the firing line with only their Kalashnikovs in hand and performed a ‚Äòbrass and ammo shakedown‚Äô with the help of his subordinates. The lower ranks turned their pockets inside out. If that wasn‚Äôt possible, the sergeants scanned for any contraband by brushing against the pocket with the back of their hand.

One of the officers had a bright idea. When he performed his searches, he took into account the differing anatomy of the aliens. He used a stick to dislodge several spent casings that ejected into the gojids‚Äô quills. When he searched Daego, he swept his hand over her stomach, where her pouch would be. He repeated the action several times before slowly meeting her eyes with his. ‚ÄúWhat is in your pouch, Medic?! Are you hiding something?!

‚ÄúNo, sir. Those are mammary glands,‚Äù Daego said nonchalantly.

The sergeant turned red-faced and jerked his hand back like her abdomen was a hot stove. ‚ÄúForgive me! I didn‚Äôt know‚Äì‚Äù

His fellow Russians burst into laughter and drowned him out. Isaac tried his best to resist, but the mirthful convulsions that wracked his body eventually collapsed him into the grass.

I, however, didn‚Äôt understand what made mammalian biology so funny.

Aggressively scrubbing down green algae on the glass each time. Cutting and removing leaves that get overwhelmed with algae. Added frog bit. The nitrates have reduced from 160 to 80, which is encouraging, but slow and too little change for my liking.

Yes, many countries have banned the use of phosphates in detergents, including the European Union and the United States. Phosphates are used in detergents to chelate calcium and magnesium ions, making them more efficient. However, phosphates can remain in wastewater and eventually make their way to natural bodies of water, causing nutrient pollution and algae feed. This can lead to eutrophication and harmful algal blooms.

Washing causes a decrease in PFAA concentrations, and in general, volatile PFASs are partly washed out of the textiles. However, washing can also increase the extractable concentration of volatile PFASs in the fabrics.Apr 11, 2022

Some PFAS have been linked to some health problems in humans including higher cholesterol, lower birth weights, lower immune response to vaccines, kidney and testicular cancer, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and changes in liver function. If you are concerned about PFAS exposures, talk to your healthcare provider.

Drugs that can cause birth defects are called 'teratogens'. A teratogen is a substance that interferes with the normal development of a fetus.

Other studies have linked pesticides to birth defects, including:
Prenatal exposure to organophosphate pesticides: Has been linked to behavior
In utero exposure to Roundup or GLY: Has been linked to birth defects and fetal loss in mammals, frogs, and chickens 
Phosphorus is a mineral that helps build strong bones during pregnancy, and it also helps with muscle contractions, blood clotting, and maintaining a normal heart rhythm.

471,https://www.reddit.com/r/fishkeeping/comments/1cgvl3c/feathery_white_growths_in_tank_harming_fish_and/,Feathery white growths in tank harming fish and invertebrates?,"This is a very long read, but I‚Äôd appreciate any insight. My partner and I don‚Äôt have nearly enough experience to know how to approach this problem, and I‚Äôm worried we‚Äôve approached it in such a way that makes identifying an appropriate treatment difficult.

I‚Äôm new to the hobby, whereas my partner is getting back into it after several years. He‚Äôs never seen anything like what we‚Äôre dealing with in our tanks, and we‚Äôre struggling to ID and treat whatever is happening.

We set up our first tank about six weeks ago and added mystery snails to start the cycle. One of the first mystery snails we added went downhill quickly, and we noticed feathery white growths that looked kind of like fungus or algae on its body as it was dying. We did some research online and assumed this was snail ‚Äúdeath slime,‚Äù to to speak, and since we didn‚Äôt see it on the other snails, didn‚Äôt think much of it.

We opted for fish-in cycling (as my partner is confident in his ability to keep water parameters in check and bacteria level healthy) and added fish about a week later. Not long after that, we had to set up a second tank for a shell-dwelling cichlid that hitched a ride in a shell purchased from a LFS. During this time, snails and a couple of otocinclus catfish were moved back and forth between the two tanks, so if the original tank was contaminated with something, both of these tanks have been exposed. We also moved a snail with a foot injury to a tiny tank that was being used to grow some plants and treated her with an herbal remedy, which will be relevant later.

One of the fish added to the main tank had a cloudy patch on one side of its body when we first got it, but this cleared up over the course of a couple of weeks. Everything else appeared healthy. About a week after adding fish, though, two of four otos (one of two in each tank) were found dead with no visible signs of disease except some reddening of the gills. Not long after, our mollies began showing signs of ich. Cue the setup of a third tank to which we moved the mystery snails as a precaution during treatment of the primary tank with Ich-X.

With the new third tank set up, we moved the snails out of the tank infected with ich and prepared to start treatment of the main tank. Just before treatment began, one of the mollies gave birth, and‚Äîconcerned about the potential impact of Ich-X on newborn fry‚Äîwe moved the fry to the tank with the snails. Treatment began in the main tank, we opted to wait and see regarding the shell-dweller tank (as the stowaway had been guarding eggs, and we now had two small cichlid fry to worry about in that tank), and we monitored the molly fry in the third tank.

The molly fry were happy and healthy for 48 hours, then *very* suddenly, we lost all 18 within an hour. It was devastating. There were no obvious signs of illness that we noticed aside from reddening gills in the final hour or so. Until they started succumbing, water parameters had been excellent. The tank had become cloudy from the bacterial bloom, but nothing else was apparent. We assumed we screwed up in opting out of treating them for ich immediately after birth.

Ich-X treatment continued in the main tank and the obvious ich infection in the mollies (and one oto) responded well. The other oto developed dropsy, and despite our efforts, we couldn‚Äôt save it. Hillstream and Kuhli loaches both tolerated the Ich-X well.

At this point the snail tank had a massive explosion of what looked like feathery white algae (which might sound familiar), and it had a significant negative impact on the snails‚Äô health. This is, sadly, the first point we realized we were dealing with way more than just ich, and more than just a single infected tank. We were finally trying to put together all of the puzzle pieces stretching back to the very first snail that succumbed to similar growths, how symptoms in the various tanks might be connected, and what that meant going forward. We started assuming we had an epistylis infection in addition to ich (since the ich was responding well to the Ich-X, it did not appear to be a misidentification of those specific white spots) and figuring out what to do about that.

Another molly gave birth around this time, and the young were in various stages of development that ranged from literal egg to slightly premature fry. The four that were developed enough to be viable went into a new tank, but only survived about a day. When we lost them, my partner thought they looked like they had succumbed to an internal infection of some sort that (sorry for the graphic description) looked like it had split their heads from the inside. Epistylis seemed the most likely culprit.

We started treating the snail tank with Maracyn Two to try to control the epistylis, as well as the herbal remedy that we had been using on the injured snail. One of the mollies and the adult cichlid had developed the early stages of fin rot, so we opted to go ahead and treat those tanks with antibiotics for both the fin rot and the assumption that both had been exposed to the epistylis as well. Those two tanks were treated with KanaPlex. The tiny tank with plants and the injured snail was still being treated with the herbal remedy (an antibacterial and antifungal treatment), and the injured snail had made what looked like an impossible recovery; this tank was the only one that didn‚Äôt appear to be affected by the infection at all.

Fast forward a week or so to the conclusion of both the Ich-X treatment in the main tank and a round of antibiotics in all tanks except the tiny one. The cichlid‚Äôs fin rot vastly improved and no signs of ich appeared in that tank. Molly fin rot vastly improved and all signs of ich were gone from the main tank. No obvious signs of the feathery white growths had appeared in either of these tanks yet; it‚Äôs possible that, especially if the antifungal and antibacterial aren‚Äôt effective on the growths, whatever it is has simply been outcompeted by green algae in these two tanks. The snails were still struggling, badly (lethargic, swollen to the point of being unable to retract into their shells) and the snail tank water was gross from the treatment, to the point where I was as worried about their water quality as the feathery stuff itself.

We decided to do something of a reset on the snail tank. They got a nice long air bath as we did a 100% water change, vinegar scrub of the tank, complete removal of the infected substrate, no immediate addition of antibiotics or any medication other than the herbal remedy to the new tank water, and a long rinse in clean water before we placed them back in the tank. This seemed to help, but they were still very swollen, and the algae/fungal/bacterial/whatever-it-is growth returned over a few days.

The last thing we could think to do was a two-part strategy: add a few shrimp to help eat the stuff that was building up on the snails themselves, and simultaneously treat for everything we could think of that it might be with NeoPlex and the herbal remedy in the water, as well as medicated food made with KanaPlex, MetroPlex, and Focus. In theory, this would control both internal and external infection regardless of whether it‚Äôs bacterial or fungal. This is the step we‚Äôre currently on, and our fingers are crossed, but the snails aren‚Äôt looking good and we just lost our first shrimp to the stuff last night.

I don‚Äôt really know where to go from here. We‚Äôre taking a sample of the growth to a local college to use their microscopes to try to identify what exactly we‚Äôre dealing with this afternoon, because we haven‚Äôt had any luck so far making an ID just with comparing it to photos online. What has been growing on every surface of the tank and the snails *looks* like a combination of white hair algae and biofilm that‚Äôs run amok to the point of suffocating invertebrates. The cloudy patch on one of the hillstream loaches looked like online photos of columnaris, but that fish is now fine, and we haven‚Äôt seen anything like that on any other fish. I didn‚Äôt get a good look at the second group of fry we lost, but my partner doesn‚Äôt think what killed them looked like cotton wool disease.

We‚Äôve thrown antifungal and antibacterial at the problem to no avail; we do see breakdown of the growth in the short term, but it returns in full force. During the complete reset of the snail tank, no filter media or airstones or anything difficult to sanitize‚Äîwith the exception of the snails themselves‚Äîreturned to the tank, so the infection is following them. If the internal infection can‚Äôt be treated with the medicated food, I don‚Äôt know how we can save the snails and shrimp, and I hate to euthanize everything in that tank; I‚Äôm very attached to the little critters, and I‚Äôm also terrified that the infection is just lying dormant in the other tanks and if we can‚Äôt control it now, we‚Äôre not going to know how to control it when that happens.",30 Apr 2024 11:25:34,reddit

I do quite a lot of hiking with my dog on greenways and moreso around Falls Lake. With the weather getting warmer now, he wants to stop and wade into creeks or the lake and cool off and drink water.

About 4 months ago at the vet, he had a specific vaccination that now I don't know the name of...the vet asked if we do any hiking and if he's exposed to natural water bodies and I said yes and so she gave him a vaccine related to that (I'd just got him, it was a long appointment, he had a ton of things done, I don't remember the name of this vaccine).

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.",26 Apr 2024 01:28:40,reddit

496,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cc5nmn,Sunburn or something else?,"Question: Scar on caudex - is this sunburn or a different problem to address? Late winter growth from January died without blooming - this is new growth. Hoping it also doesn‚Äôt yellow and drop off. 

Context: I‚Äôm in Phoenix AZ, zone 9b. The sun is powerful and we have extreme heat in summer. Dry air. I‚Äôve had this plant for a little over 1 year. It came with this mark and it hasn‚Äôt changed. 

The base was stained brown and had some hard water buildup. It came this way, but the stain got worse over time. I just used a toothbrush and some cinnamon paste to clean it up, so that‚Äôs why it is wet. The caudex is hard to the press, no mush. 

I water it thoroughly when the soil has dried out and the pot is noticeably lighter. I use an algae fertilizer every couple of weeks except winter. It‚Äôs still in the original soil. 

Last year it was outdoors until mid June. It sits on a table with a retractable umbrella and receives overhead east and west sun when umbrella is not up. I turned it every couple of days. Usually watered once a week during the high heat. 

Brought it inside in mid June due to excessive heat to sit in the north windows next to my aeroponic garden under the large grow lights. It didn‚Äôt get watered from the lab. Indoor summer watering cut down to every other week or so, when it was dry. Put back outdoors in the sun for fall in Sept. Then brought it indoors through winter in Nov. Watered it once in Jan cuz it started growing. Skipped water in Feb. Watered once in March and April. Brought back outside in 2024 a week ago now that night temps are over 50. 

New growth in photo has noticeable sunburn. Recently trimmed a few stems back from 1/2-3/4 inch of shrivel and put cinnamon on the open spots. Not sure why the tips shriveled? The new growth from early late winter this year pretty much just yellowed, died and dropped off without even blooming - what you see here is the 2nd round of new growth this year. It appears healthier, perhaps from more sun. Or maybe I didn‚Äôt water it enough while it was growing in winter cuz I thought it was supposed to be dormant. 

Wondering if I have a scarred caudex problem, watering problem, or the change of environment is freaking this plant out. Or all the above.",24 Apr 2024 14:26:34,reddit

Firstly, shock your pool with a potent algaecide to swiftly kill off existing algae blooms. Utilize a pool brush to scrub algae from pool surfaces, focusing on walls, floors, and corners where algae tend to proliferate. 

Additionally, maintain proper water circulation and filtration by running your pump and filter system regularly. Enhance your pool's sanitation by adjusting chemical levels, particularly chlorine, to inhibit algae growth. Regularly vacuum your pool using a reliable manual pool vacuum specifically designed to tackle algae.

502,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecology/comments/1catl7z/why_pleistocene_rewilding_is_a_terrible_idea/,"Why ""Pleistocene rewilding"" is a terrible idea","So I am interested in conservation and there is one topic that I am starting to read about more often: Pleistocene Rewilding. Pleistocene rewilding is the idea that we should try to de-extinct Pleistocene megafauna and/or introduce proxy animals to areas where they never existed to fill niches left vacant by the extinction of megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene. This idea is a terrible idea in my opinion for a few reasons:

1. It is uncertain if humans were even the main cause of the extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna. Megafauna extinctions have been attributed to the arrival of Homo sapiens in the Americas and Australia. This is because it was once believed that megafauna disappeared just after as humans arrived in those places. However, there is increasing evidence that humans have coexisted with megafauna in those places for millennia. Footprints have been found in New Mexico that date to around 21,000 years old.  The dates for the arrival of humans in Australia are being pushed back as well. Thus, humans and megafauna in those places coexisted for tens of thousands of years. This means that there was plenty of time for megafauna to adapt to the presence of humans. There is currently no consensus on what caused the extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene.
2. Ecosystems have changed since then. Even if humans were the main cause of the extinction of megafauna at the end of the Pleistocene, the truth is that ecosystems have changed for several millennia. Thus, introducing a new species to that area could have disastrous effects. Hippos in Colombia for example, are often touted as an example of unintentional rewinding, but in reality they are an invasive species that causes algae blooms and competes with native wildlife. Introducing non-native megafauna could thus have disastrous affects on ecosystems. De-extincting old species could also take resources away from saving living species.

Thus, Pleistocene rewilding is a terrible idea that shouldn't be taken seriously since it is uncertain if humans were even the main cause of the extinction of Pleistocene megafauna and introducing non-native megafauna to areas could threaten local ecosystems.",22 Apr 2024 22:37:26,reddit

504,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1camdtv/zoologist_aquaticcold_review_cow_and_camel/,Zoologist Aquatic/Cold Review (+Cow and Camel),"I'm trying to round out my collection and am on the hunt for aquatic and cold fragrances. These were my first attempts at Zoologist and I will definitely try more. I also tried Cow and Camel because I was curious. Also I tend to not care a ton about performance - if it's still there in some way after about 5 hours I will consider that a success and if it had more longevity, I consider that a bonus.

**Zooligist: Dragonfly**

* First impression: I love this. I‚Äôm getting aquatic notes, delicate florals, and fresh spring greens. It‚Äôs evocative of spring.
* Drydown: I also definitely get the aldehydes but I‚Äôm shocked to say that I like the quietly aldehydic quality of this. It softens it and makes it almost misty. My only real complaint about this is that despite the basenotes being listed as ‚ÄúRainwater, Moss, Patchouli, Tonka, Vetiver, Benzoin, Cashmeran‚Äù, the end of the life of this fragrance is overwhelmingly floral. It‚Äôs a nice and well-balanced floral and I do detect those base notes but it‚Äôs a little too stuffy for me. The stream is gone. I'm trying to layer this with some Demeter fragrances to keep those top notes going.
* Performance: I‚Äôm also surprised by the longevity and projection of this one. I‚Äôve only had it on a few hours but it‚Äôs still going strong.
* Concept: An insect is a unique concept for a fragrance and I don‚Äôt think this fragrance is that out-of-left-field. I‚Äôve smelled aquatic florals kind of like this before about 25 years ago so I see why people would think it‚Äôs not very interesting or even kind of retro. However, I think there is something to a concept. While thinking about this fragrance I remembered Afton Water by Robert Burns - his lover is sleeping by a stream and he‚Äôs describing a lovely green scene with birds chirping and flowers blooming. I‚Äôm really glad that the concept helped me make that connection.
* Verdict: This ends up being in my #2 spot so I may not buy a FB right now but I might in the future! I wish so much that I could smell the original purple version but there are no decants of it anywhere.

**Zoologist: Penguin**

* First Impression: This is the first fragrance I‚Äôve smelled that I can say somehow smells like snow. Snow and some kind of woodiness. This is very pleasant but there's not a lot going on here.
* Drydown:  OK, I just checked the notes and I totally get the suede. That‚Äôs a note that can be hit-or-miss but this does a great job of incorporating it. This is a pretty linear fragrance so it's hard to say much about it.
* Performance: Not the best. Maybe 3-4 hours?
* Concept: It is successfully cold and barren smelling. Nothing green grows here. It's evocative but it's also not bringing up any emotions.
* Verdict: I don‚Äôt think this is a ‚ÄúI will add this to my cart the moment I get money in my hands‚Äù kind of fragrance but I may buy it eventually. I definitely don‚Äôt have anything like it. Maybe I'll snag a larger decant for now.

**Zoologist: Snowy Owl**

* First Impression: When I read Zoologist reviews there‚Äôs always one person saying that the fragrance smells like a barnyard/manure/dirty animal and I haven‚Äôt gotten that from any of their fragrances so far. I‚Äôm afraid that changed with Snowy Owl. It genuinely smells like the zoo on a winter day. I‚Äôm just getting something really dirty and fecal from this.
* Drydown: I waited 3 hours to see if the drydown would change it but alas, this was a scrubber. Is it the civet?
* Concept: I get the cold elements and it definitely smells animalic so I guess in that way it was a success.
* Verdict: Hard pass but if this smells amazing on you I'm happy for you!

**Zoologist: Seahorse**

* First Impression: It‚Äôs definitely marine! I‚Äôm getting aquatic florals, emphasis on the aquatic. It's very briny. Something about it does make me think ‚Äúwarm sea‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcold sea‚Äù. There is a greenness, too.
* Drydown: You do detect the basenotes of algae, vetiver, and ambergris more and I love them but otherwise it doesn‚Äôt change too much in the drydown. I can still detect the seaweed/algae note hours later and I wish it was stronger! I haven't really smelled many fragrances with those kinds of notes and I like it.
* Concept: So many marine fragrances make you feel more like you're on a beach on even on a boat but this really makes you feel like you're underwater. Aquatic floral made sense for Dragonfly since they buzz around in the air but florals for an animal that lives underwater feels a bit odd. However the floral notes in this are much more subtle than in Dragonfly. I do wonder if they could have made it a bit quirkier for such an odd little animal but that's just me. I think this is conceptually successful.
* Performance: I‚Äôm happy with it. It has less longevity and projection than Dragonfly but still good enough.
* Verdict: Of these 4 aquatic/cold fragrances, this is my favorite. I will definitely be buying a FB of Seahorse.

**Zoologist: Camel**

* First Impression: It opens with a strong burst of dried fruits backed by myrrh, incense, and other amber-y notes. I am fascinated by how many people think it smells like a dirty animal because I get zero animalic notes off the bat. This is definitely sensual and resinous. It immediately evocative of what the West imagines the Middle East to smell like (more on that in a minute).
* Drydown: I do get the musk as time goes on but I really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very strong at any point. It dries down to a resinous, musky sandalwood.
* Concept: My main beef with this fragrance is that it doesn‚Äôt really evoke the scene that it says it will. It‚Äôs not a chilly desert night with a sky full of stars. Adding the smell of sand and maybe just a hint of something ozonic or cold (or scorching hot?) might have gotten me there. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love this fragrance - I just wish it was more evocative of the landscape the animal lives in. If this was just a perfume trying to evoke the Orientalized image of ‚ÄúThe Middle East‚Äù I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a home run. Guerlain and many other have been doing this for over a century though so it's not very unique. I also feel a lil weird about this sort of generic Orientalist picture it paints in 2024.
* Performance: Really good as you'd expect for a heavy ambery fragrance. You're definitely getting bang for your buck with this one.
* Verdict: I loved every second I had this on my skin. I already have some ambery fragrances so I don't think this is an immediate purchase for me just because I'm trying to round out my collection but I may get the travel size.

**Zoologist: Cow**

* First Impression: I used to work for a free-range animal farm and spent a lot of time in grassy meadows with cows and their babies. I had such high hopes for this! I think my hopes were too high because my first impression is ""meh"". I‚Äôm getting apple, hay, and maybe a touch of creaminess and a whisper of green.
* Drydown: I‚Äôm a little let down as the description evoked a meadow and I'm not getting the breeze or the green grass. As time goes on the lactonic note does make more of an appearance. This is a nice, wearable fragrance but I hoped for more creaminess and more ‚Äúmeadow‚Äù notes that would ground it in a place.
* Performance: This one has less longevity than the others - just a few hours.
* Verdict: I was so ready to love this but I just wanted more. I do like it. I will keep wearing the tester and see if it grows on me. I don't think I'd buy more of it but if someone gifted me this I'd be happy with",22 Apr 2024 17:20:49,reddit

Dr John Barry says Minister Andrew Muir should alert British and Irish governments and demand help     

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today at 06:35

The money allocated by Stormont to address ecological problems on Lough Neagh ‚Äúwill not touch the sides‚Äù of what is needed, an environmental academic has said.

Last year the Lough was besieged by blooms of blue-green algae, causing vast swathes of thick green substances on its surface.

The crisis resulted from the perfect storm of higher temperatures, prolonged periods of rain and higher nutrient content in the water due to agricultural run-off.

Environment Minister Andrew Muir told the Assembly on Monday that ¬£1.6m had been allocated by the Executive to his department in capital funding and no resource funding for the issues besetting the lough, with officials now looking at other ways to fund the work needed.

Mr Muir said the allocation given to his department was ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù.

He added: ‚ÄúWe need to invest in turning the situation round in Lough Neagh.‚Äù

The minister also told the Assembly he had commissioned scientific research to assess the effect of removing sand from the lough.

Dr John Barry, Professor of Green Political Economy at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast, said the amount allocated would not be anywhere near enough to solve the issues.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not even going to touch the sides,‚Äù he told the Belfast Telegraph.

‚ÄúThe timescales ‚Äî going on the meeting Save Our Lough had with him last week ‚Äî were in terms of decades.

‚ÄúThere is an American adage ‚Äî a day late and a dollar short ‚Äî but it‚Äôs going to be decades late and a lot of money short to address this.

‚ÄúIt is disappointing; the longer we delay addressing the causes of the problems with the Lough, it‚Äôs going to take longer and cost more.‚Äù    

With warmer temperatures expected in 2024 due to the El Nino phenomenon, Dr Barry said the issues that plagued Lough Neagh last year would be even worse this year.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be warmer this year, so it is probably going to be worse than it was last year,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe crisis is not caused by climate change, but climate change means the water is warmer, which causes more energy and therefore the algae blooms increase.

‚ÄúIt is a disaster and there is no sign the government is going to be taking it with any degree of seriousness. This really should be an Executive Office priority, not just for DAERA.‚Äù

Dr Barry said Mr Muir should be alerting the British and Irish governments to the scale of the problem and demanding more money.

‚ÄúI think this is such an emergency and it has been declared as such. This is 40% of our drinking water, the largest freshwater lake in these islands. It is an extraordinary situation,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt he going to the British government and Irish government and saying, ‚ÄòGive us more money‚Äô? That would be evidence that he is really taking this seriously, rather than asking his [Executive] colleagues nicely.

‚ÄúHe has now tasked his officials to go and find a bit of money down the back of a sofa and we all know how that‚Äôs going to work out ‚Äî it‚Äôs not going to be enough.

‚ÄúThis is going to run and run; it‚Äôs going to get considerably worse. We could be looking at irreparable damage to the Lough unless it‚Äôs addressed now.‚Äù    

It comes after the Assembly passed a motion calling for an ‚Äúecological and biodiversity crisis‚Äù to be declared in Northern Ireland.

The motion, tabled by the SDLP opposition, also urged DAERA to bring forward legislation to establish an independent Environmental Protection Agency as outlined in the 2020 New Decade, New Approach agreement.

Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the passing of the motion.

‚ÄúIn the past few days with the spell of hot weather we are already seeing signs of the re-emergence of the toxic algae blooms which wreaked such havoc over the past year, killing wildlife, destroying biodiversity and impacting local businesses,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe reasons for the ecological crisis at the Lough are well-worn, but it is deeply disappointing that we stand here again on the brink of another summer where little has been done to address these issues.

‚ÄúParties have been clear on the need to act to protect the long-term future of the Lough.

‚ÄúOne of the Minister‚Äôs first visits after assuming office was to the Lough, but we need action if we are going to save this precious resource.

‚ÄúProtecting our environment should be a priority for every department and there needs to be ownership of this issue from the entire Executive.

‚ÄúThe SDLP has been calling for an independent Environmental Protection Agency for well over a decade and it was agreed as part of New Decade, New Approach.

‚ÄúWhat we have been doing up until this point clearly isn‚Äôt working and it is our view that an independent body will give us the best chance of safeguarding our natural resources like Lough Neagh.‚Äù",14 May 2024 04:55:28,reddit

You can‚Äôt tell by this picture but the entire tank is green- the blue you are seeing are the sundown lights. I completely covered the tank for 3 days and it didn‚Äôt help. I used purigen as recommended by my local FS and that didn‚Äôt help either. Help! ,13 May 2024 22:41:37,reddit
513,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1crfcmm,Help! Well water and swimming pool chemicals,"So we manage (as volunteers) a 160,000 gallon residential pool. We have a well that we fill with. It‚Äôs basically an endless supply of water as I can drain and fill 3 times in less than two weeks. 

Our problem is we have a few leaks (we are still actively locating through a third party company) and lose about 2‚Äù of water a night. I‚Äôm not looking for information on the leaks right now but mainly the following problem.

I have everything perfectly balanced and within the suggested limits for all chemicals, other than my cyanuric acid is extremely low and my phosphate level was a little high but just treated that last week and are in normal range below 100 PPB. Low cyanuric was intentional as a test to see if it played a part in our issue.

With that said, every time I add the well water, which is every morning right now, the water turns a deep green. Not an algae green per se but more of a ‚Äúmetallic‚Äù green for lack of better word. We battled this last year and somehow we just stopped having the issue after a while and I can‚Äôt remember what we did differently.

Currently, when the water turns green (starts in the deep end where the well water is being added) it takes about an hour from start of adding new water for a perfectly crystal blue pool to turn fully green.

I‚Äôve taken multiple water samples for testing from the clear, the green, the well water itself, the backwash water etc. all of them show virtually non existent metal content. However, when I use sc 1000, the water clears up the next day. But as soon as I add well water it‚Äôs back to green. Also, if I add a lb of vitamin c, the pool turns back clear blue within 15 mins. You can watch it turn, but again, when I add water it turns back green.

I gutted the pump room this year and went from 4 DE filters to 4 glass media filters. We are also running a pulsar auto feeder with calcium hypo brickets feeding the pool. We took out our tricolor feeders and no longer use tablets.

With using the sc1000, the CL has been low due to it zapping it but not below a 2. When I was bringing the chemicals up initially I put shock in and it turned the pool green within an hour. 

Does anyone have any insights? If I‚Äôve left something out I‚Äôm happy to elaborate, we have tried so many things lately and just not sure what to do next.

The green pictures were taken before I vacuumed. I vacuumed and then put in vitamin C and took this blue pictures 25 mins after it was as green as the pictures.

This is the discussion thread for Economics of Money and Banking¬†**Warsaw Lecture 1: Why Is Money Difficult**?

* [Lecture Video](https://www.youtube.com/live/n9G8TPyF0Q8?si=8ZaFbX8RtspowtK-)

Ideally, we want the plumbing of money and banking to operate smoothly behind the scenes. But only through awareness of that plumbing and its mechanics can we begin to explain what happens when the plumbing breaks. When ignoring the machinery of money and banking, we may be able to devise somewhat reasonable models for how the economy works in normal times, but we won't be able to explain financial crises.

This lecture provides motivation for learning the Money View and calls attention to intellectual/psychological hurdles that people often need to overcome when trying to understand money and banking.

***NOTE: The audio in this lecture only plays over the left channel. I recommend downmixing to mono in your computer's audio settings, so it doesn't distract you.***

The slides are not always visible in the recording. I've included their content below.

# Liquidity

Drawing theory from banking practice, the Money View emphasizes the central role of¬†***liquidity***. The liquidity of an economic entity (individual, household, firm, government, etc.) is its ability to meet payment commitments as they come due. Failing to settle payment commitments means defaulting on debt. Firms‚Äîbanks, in particular‚Äîthat fail to meet their commitments won't stay in business for very long.

>***""Liquidity kills you quick.""***  
*‚ÄîPerry Mehrling*

We can divide liquidity into three categories based on the source of money (settlement funds):

1. ***Monetary liquidity ‚Äî***¬†the ability to spend money in your possession.
2. ***Funding liquidity ‚Äî***¬†the ability to borrow money.
3. ***Market liquidity ‚Äî***¬†the ability to sell assets for money.

Funding liquidity and market liquidity depend partly on the general state of the market. To sell an asset or borrow money, you need someone else‚Äîa counterparty‚Äîto buy your asset or lend you the money. If the market dries up, the counterparties disappear.

Monetary liquidity is the only type of liquidity that requires no counterparty. You can always spend money that you already have. A large enough reserve of money ensures that you'll be able to meet immediate payment obligations, even in times of adversity.

# Slide 2: Many Faces of the Global Financial Crisis (1:32 ‚Äì 7:24)

* Crisis of risk management system
   * Private: Microprudential, Value At Risk, Basel
   * Public: Macroeconomic Stabilization, Inflation Target
* Crisis of political economy
   * Central Bank and Wall Street (US)
   * Central Bank and State Treasury (Europe)
   * Central Bank Cooperation (Global)
* Crisis of global¬†**liquidity**¬†system
   * Funding Liquidity‚ÄîLender of Last Resort
   * Market Liquidity‚ÄîDealer of Last Resort

Mehrling opens with the 2007‚Äì2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC). As with the Great Depression of the 1930s and the ""stagflation"" of the 1970s, I imagine that economists will continue to revisit the GFC for decades to come. There's a lot to unpack.

The GFC challenged the idea that we could prevent financial crises either by getting individual entities to manage their risk better or by attempting to stabilize the system as a whole.

We can understand the GFC as a liquidity event in the global dollar system. Entities became unable to meet their payment commitments. Both funding liquidity and market liquidity dried up. As a result, we learned that backstopping funding liquidity alone (lender of last resort) is not enough. Market liquidity needs a backstop too (dealer of last resort).

# Slide 3: From Lender-of-Last-Resort to Dealer-of-Last-Resort (7:24 ‚Äì 11:22)

https://preview.redd.it/pagb13mdv00d1.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=07c8c5b1694ba0cd038e33909ba08825c3e767f9

In this visualization of the Fed's balance sheet, assets are on the top, and liabilities on the bottom. Starting in 2008, the balance sheet of the Fed expanded rapidly. It added huge amounts to both its assets and liabilities. And that balance sheet has never returned to the way it was before the crisis.

Starting with this crisis, the Fed backstopped asset markets directly. Being a lender of last resort means prmosing to lend at a high interest rate to those who need it money. Being a dealer of last resort means promising to buy at a fairly low price from anyone who wants to sell.

# Slide 4: From Domestic to International Lender-of-Last-Resort (11:22 ‚Äì 13:33)

https://preview.redd.it/g56uck0gv00d1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=08c9e124856a0f9195b81384cf5a07d9edd928dd

We might normally expect arbitrage to eliminate price differences. When that doesn't happen, it's a sign that something is wrong. In 2008, something was preventing people from borrowing dollars in the domestic money market and lending them off-shore (as Eurodollars).

In 2008, the central banks prevented another great depression by supporting the global system.

# Slide 5: The (Fatal) Abstractions of Modern Economic Thinking (13:33 ‚Äì 14:21)

* Representative Agent
* Intertemporal Equilibrium
* Monetary Veil (Neutrality)
* Legal Foundations
* Market Microstructure

>**Liquidity**

Standard economics abstracts from money and liquidity. But this means that standard economics won't have much to say about what happens when there's a crisis in the ""monetary plumbing.""

# Slide 6: The Money View (14:21 ‚Äì 15:45)

* Banking as a Payments System
   * Copeland (1952): A Moneyflow Economy
   * Minsky (1957): The Survival Constraint
* Banking as a Market Making System
   * Hawtrey (1919): Hierarchy of Money and Credit
   * Hicks (1989): Centrality of the Dealer Function
   * Bagehot (1873): Dealer of Last Resort

These two pillars of the Money View both concern liquidity. Viewing¬†**banking as a payments system**¬†emphasizes what happens when you run out of liquidity: you can't make a payment you promised to make. Viewing¬†**banking as a market-making system**¬†emphasizes where liquidity comes from in the first place: dealers‚Äîincluding banks‚Äîsupply liquidity to the system by making markets. A breakdown in market-making puts strain on the payments system and causes payment commitments to go unfulfilled.

# Why Is Money Difficult?

# Slide 7 (15:45 ‚Äì 17:21)

>***Why is it so difficult for me to learn this and figure this out? Why did it take me so long? I don't think I'm stupid.***

>*‚ÄîLecture*

Understanding money means unlearning some of the ways of thinking that economics tends to encourage.

# Slide 8: I. Alchemy (17:21 ‚Äì 18:20)

https://preview.redd.it/4ybe2dvkv00d1.png?width=648&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ac9d9f4f3f78b3246988358ff7197406d2c26a3

* Banking is a swap of IOUs

Lecture 1 of the MOOC will properly introduce us to balance-sheet notation. The above diagram shows that, at the moment of loan origination, the bank and the borrower (me) are both promising each other money. It is a mutual obligation in which two promises being made:

1. The loan is the liability of the borrower and an asset to the bank.
2. The deposit is the liability of the bank and an asset to the borrower.

We can visualize the same transaction with arrows representing the payments.

https://preview.redd.it/4y5rz41qv00d1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4a7b6ce64a33ad9b9a253354c21dd2b4f7e6cbd

Here, it is more clear that the bank and the borrower are both paying each other. The green color represents ""payment by issuance."" The bank issues deposits to pay the borrower. The borrower issues the loan to pay the bank.

Once the loan has been originated, the bank is holding the loan and the borrower is holding deposits in the bank.

https://preview.redd.it/kq4uh3ctv00d1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=423cfec8adcbbfe3534d182662c4810c7fe6f52f

I shade the deposits purple to show that the deposits are money to the entity holding them as an asset. The loan is not. The borrower has swapped his own newly issued non-money liability for the newly issued liability of the bank, which is money.

On the balance sheet of the bank, the deposits fund the loan. At least initially, the borrower, by holding deposits in the bank, is indirectly funding his own loan. The bank is intermediating between a depositor and a borrower. The depositor and the borrower just happen to be the same entity. It is as if the borrower deposited cash in the bank and then borrowed the cash back from the bank.

https://preview.redd.it/27ukhv5wv00d1.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=36acdec075421c1bab9b3baf14b42191943b08fe

The cash is yellow to show ""payment by assignment."" The cash asset is merely being transferred from one balance sheet to another. But these notional cash flows net out, meaning that no cash actually needs to flow. And if no cash needs to flow, then no cash needs to¬†*exist*¬†to make this loan possible.

# Slide 9: Psychological Barrier (18:20 ‚Äì 20:32)

* Fetish of the ""Real"": What is being ""loaned""?
   * Fraud?
* Free lunch resistance: Something from nothing?
* **""Inside"" or credit character of money, versus ""outside"" personal experience of money**

>***The normal language view of a loan is that I can't lend you a bicycle unless I have a bicycle. If I lend you something I don't own, that's illegal or fraud or something. It's a problem. How can you lend something that you don't own.***

>*‚ÄîLecture*

You¬†*can*¬†promise something you don't own, as long as you can reliably get the thing being promised. The key insight about money is that it's possible for a promise for money to¬†*be*¬†money.

In his History of Economic Analysis (1954), Joseph Schumpeter said, ‚ÄúYou cannot ride on a claim to a horse, but you can pay with a claim to money.‚Äù (p. 305)

# Slide 10: II. Hybridity (20:32 ‚Äì 22:11)

* Money Supply, Public and Private

https://preview.redd.it/nqp5kydyv00d1.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9f9e7c55946ebd760346550e31d09605907726b

Currency (public money) and deposits (private money) trade at par. That means, they're exchangeable one for one.

# Slide 11: Political Barrier (22:11 ‚Äì 25:37)

* Left: Chartalism, Knapp, Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)
   * Money as creation of the state, ""authority""
* Right: Metallism, Menger, Austrian
   * Money as creation of the marketplace, ""trust
* **Symbiosis: as lichen, algae + fungi**

>***The system is hybrid. It's public and private. Each one adds something, and they mutually support each other. It's a symbiotic system. It's not that one is illegitimate and the other one is legitimate, and that we have to decide which one is legitimate and get rid of the other one. We have to manage a system that has both features, in which the liabilities of private banking and the liabilities of public banking trade at par. How do they trade at par? What makes them trade at par? And when there's stress on the system, that par is under pressure.***

>***Things that look like credit in bad times begin to have more money-like features. It becomes much easier to spend them, and people accept them as means of payment in a boom.

* Prices ""clear"" markets, and time is just an additional dimension of commodity space
* Instability comes from outside, exogenous shocks absorbed through price flexibility

The system as a whole never settles into a stable equilibrium because credit is inherently unstable.

# Slide 20 (43:20 ‚Äì 46:35)

>***This is just not the way the world is. It's not a collection of nation-states. It's a global system. And each central bank is part of this hierarchy. It's not flat. It's hierarchical, the system.

Shadow Banking, also known as market-based finance, is ""money market funding of capital market lending.""

The economy is fundamentally global. It is not a collection of individual nation-states knit together. Yet we often treat it that way when analyzing the economy or taking statistics. The ""triple coincidence"" refers to the idea that the GDP area, the political decision-making unit, and the currency area all match each other. Our statistics tend to take the triple coincidence for granted, but there's no general reason why it should be true.

* [*Breaking Free of the Triple Coincidence in International Finance*¬†by Adjiev, McCauley and Shin (2015)](https://www.bis.org/publ/work524.htm)

The dollar, in particular, is a global currency. Most dollar action happens outside of the United States. Depending on where the banks happen to be located, otherwise equivalent states of the world can produce very different statistical measurements.

>***It's a global system, and the global currency is the dollar. And it's a private dollar. It's the liabilities of banks, not the liability of the central bank.***

At each layer of the international hierarchy, we can see the same kind of swap-of-IOUs alchemy in action.

# Slide 24: Payment Versus Funding, I (54:23 ‚Äì 1:01:42)

* Purchase of house facilitated by ""alchemy,"" seller funding and interbank borrowing, in the first instance

Above, I have renamed ""Fed Funds"" to ""Money Market,"" because ""Fed Funds"" is just what we call the money market when it's being used by particular entities. I have also combined Mehrling's stage 2 and 3 to emphasize that the money-market funding is what¬†*allows*¬†the deposit to move in the first place. The seller's bank (your bank) won't take on a deposit liability without an asset to match. And that's what the money-market funding is.

The transfer of the deposit from the buyer's bank to the seller's bank is shaded blue. This is to denote ""payment by novation."" One bank is paying another by taking on the other bank's liability.

As we saw before with the swap of IOUs, the buyer of the house (me) initially funds his own loan by holding deposits in the bank. But he borrowed those deposits to use to purchase the house from the seller (you). The seller ends up with the deposits.

https://preview.redd.it/28vfgfcpw00d1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d662197fd501cefa82dcb0db1de1eb6bdb7e573

After the home has been purchased, the mortgage loan is ultimately being funded by the seller of the house. The seller holds deposits in his bank. The seller's bank provides money-market funding to the buyer's bank. And the buyer's bank provides the loan to the buyer.

https://preview.redd.it/ftyp74etw00d1.png?width=338&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbd85d69e98f86f0f9e91281aad2f7533161cef

We can also split the second step into two parts to separate the interbank payment from the money-market funding of the deficit position. To make the balance sheets work out, we can add in the reserves that Mehrling left out.

https://preview.redd.it/lht6w0yww00d1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd405638fa0c9e556209f8064e4cd5c83c747756

This version uses money reserves to grease the wheels of the trade, but the reserves just end up back where they started.

# Slide 25: Payment Versus Funding IIa (1:01:42 ‚Äì 1:04:53)

https://preview.redd.it/w1z11vwax00d1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=48669f9bc4e26d31a11a2426c168711a9575fbc9

* Final funding of loan facilitated by money destruction, larger society funding

In step three, the deposit and the money-market funding cancel each other out. There is a mutual release of liabilities. This is the opposite of the mutual obligation we get from a swap of IOUs. The payments are shaded red to denote ""payment by set-off."" One entity pays another by canceling a debt owed.

Here is the same set of transactions, but using payment arrows.

https://preview.redd.it/6weyhr6kx00d1.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=a424a89e88dc0d9e19241f96dc38017204b8db64

From the perspective of ""society,"" they're holding an annuity as an asset instead of money. Money has been ""destroyed.""

# Slide 26: Payment Versus Funding IIb (1:04:53 ‚Äì 1:06:52)

* Final funding of the loan facilitated by shadow banking, society funding

Now, the loan is funded in the money market. Unlike with the annuity, which is locked in, the ultimate funding has to be perpetually rolled over.

# Slide 27: Crisis and Prices (1:06:52 ‚Äì 1:07:00)

Now we have some context for this slide we saw at the beginning (Slide 4). The price of money-market funding is being bid up.

# Slide 28: Crisis and Balance Sheets (1:07:00 ‚Äì 1:08:01)

And we understand Slide 3 now, too. The Fed took the shadow-banking system on to its own balance sheet. It became a dealer (or market-maker) of last resort.

# Slide 29: System Dynamics and Thought Dynamics (1:08:01 ‚Äì 1:15:02)

* Elasticity of Credit vs. Discipline of Money
   * Banking School vs. Currency School
* Bankers' bank vs. Government Bank
   * Peace finance vs. War (Development) finance
* Bank credit vs. Market Credit
   * Montary economics vs. Financial economics
* Core vs. Periphery
   * Global finance vs. National finance

>***The system we're trying to understand is in constant motion, and it's changing. Sometimes, it's moving and it's in a boom phase‚Äìit's the elasticity of credit. Sometimes, it's in a discipline phase‚Äìit's the discipline of money. Sometimes, there's wars and it's all public money‚Äìit's all government finance. Sometimes, there's peace, and it's all private finance. Sometimes, all the action is in the periphery. Sometimes, all the action is in the core of the system.***

>*‚ÄîLecture*



>***System dynamics and thought dynamics are intertwined. The evolution of monetary thought comes along with the evolution of the system as a whole.***

Today's globalized world is, in some ways, more like the gold-standard world of the late 1800s than it is like the post-World War II era.

Melvin (Bryan Melvin)**

**EXCERPT 1:**


As He [Jesus] was speaking to me, these thoughts entered my mind: ‚ÄúIt is appointed once for a man to die. When it is not that time, returning is an option decided. Children were raised; others were raised, as it was not their appointed hour, but mine. God is a God of the living and not the dead. When you arrive, say two words at that particular point of overwhelming and they are: My Name in your tongue and my Title.‚Äù At the end of these words, He reached into His robe and withdrew keys of many odd shapes and design, all bound by a connecting brass rung. Taking one key from the ring, he turned toward a door that appeared like a wall of mist that lay off to His left-hand side. As He inserted this key into the doorway that was arched like a gate, the mist parted, unrolling as a scroll, exposing a greenish-black narrow hole. In this hole there appeared a tunnel that led neither down, up, sideways, this way, or that. It was just there: a vortex. 


**EXCERPT 2:**



The creature before me had a vile appearance. It stood about fourfeet-eight inches tall and had somewhat human features. Its skin color was dark yellowish-green with a moldy texture. Its skin appeared reptilian/saurian like. It had human raptor-like feet and a short chunky tail. Its teeth resembled those of a shark. Its breath was so foul that the very atmosphere surrounding it was like heat waves off of sun-drenched pavement on a hot summer day. Its steamy breath distorted its round human-like reptilian face and gave it an appearance of having many eyes; yet, it had two or maybe three at the most. With its lizard-like arms it tried to grab me in an evil embrace of welcome. All I could do was repeat a Name and a Title, which caused it to retreat a short distance away. I felt a presence behind me, but I was too afraid to turn my gaze from the creature to look. This small foul smelling ogre‚Äôs eyes kept darting at something in back of me that was emitting a blue purplish hue. The ghoul just grinned and muttered out loud. I stood facing this murmuring hissing creature. Gesturing with its hands and jabbering gibberish mixed with a few words of English, this ghastly being appeared to be attempting to speak to me like a foreigner trying to explain directions to a tourist with a limited vocabulary in which to converse. I was the tourist. It was difficult to understand. This beast seemed to be saying in a deep raspy guttural tone of broken English mixed with gibberish I did not understand and said, ‚ÄúCome follow me, (gerrr); I‚Äôll show you half of the Kingdom. (hara-is) Come follow me (hisss) and have (errr) half of the Kingdom. (Alla ohst) Come (Sur-grrr) follow me through the veil; a road out, to, from, above, lies beyond (hesee). It‚Äôs been granted to thee to see, (grr-eko) follow me (ahka)‚Äù This disgusting foul smelling saurian brute walked with a shuffling manner towards the skyline, which was bathed orange-red by sunset, motioning for me to follow. Away from the house on the hill, away from the apparitions inside its walls, it walked. I followed continuously speaking a Name and Title as fast as I could without cease. Coming to what appeared to be the end of the horizon, the creature reached forth and parted the skyline as one would a curtain or veil. It walked through the torn hole bidding me to follow. I walked through this jagged frayed crack in the skyline and gazed upon a land unknown and best forgotten that was waiting on the other side, beckoning to be seen. Then it dawned on me where I was: the fiery pit, hell‚Äôs deep hole.




**EXCERPT 3:**





I followed the rank creature and immediately emerged on the other
side of the horizon. A wide, dirty, flat, barren expanse of land gently
sloped downward, betraying an endless circular spiral of misery. On
the left side of the coiled grade were rows and rows of cubes with
more cubes columned high, forming a wall of ten-by-ten foot
partitions mirroring the events displayed inside.
Each cube was stacked six high, marring each ascending and
descending spiraling level‚Äôs wall like a dirty mirror. The wide expanse
was a road. Strange entities were traveling on it. This wide dusty
road ended at a circular void, highlighting the center of this hellish
domain.
The cubes appeared encompassed by thin smoke-tinted, gelatinlike walls. Each cube appeared to be about ten feet by ten feet
square. You could see into these but not out of them. Within every
chamber resided an individual person, trapped, unable to escape as
I had.


Looking through the torn wall of the cube I had just stepped out of,
the house and tree within were hauntingly calling my name to return.
Perplexed, I stepped back for another glance at this cubicle. I was
surprised that it was so small. Inside it had seemed so large!
Turning, I saw the lizard-like being a few feet from me, reaching its
ugly, greenish-yellow arms as if to drag me away to a desperate fate.
Boxer style, I blocked the attempt. This fiend stepped back, grinning
ear to ear.
This beast began hissing and making strange murmurs that
sounded as if it were trying to say something. It rocked back and
forth while gesturing with its hands like it was in a hurry to go
someplace.
The creature‚Äôs mutterings became loud within my ears, as if one
were turning up the volume on a buzzing amp. I became dizzy. My
sight was briefly distorted. Then, in a flash, everything came back
into sharp focus.
Despite its hissing and gibberish, I began to strangely understand
its speech without difficulty. While I could hear it speak in another
language, I heard in plain English. This creature began speaking in
broken rhymes in a rough, raspy manner, interrupted often with highpitched screeches. It spoke:
‚ÄúDimensions of eternity hold no bounds. A small area can appear
as big as a country or as small as an ant‚Äôs hole. Neither size nor
depth matters here; only space fashioned by one‚Äôs mind. Within the
walls one cannot escape what one dreads the most. I am (a) HOST
here. What one sows is what one REAPS! What one sows is what
one REAPS! What one sows is what one REAPS! Come, follow me.‚Äù
The devilish host pointed across the wide, vacant expanse of road.
Within its spongy, dry, brown dirt, small maggot-like creatures arose,
squealed, and dipped back into little dark holes like insects. Hissing
and spitting this lizardlike brute said, ‚ÄúCome and see, it‚Äôs been
granted to thee.


Let‚Äôs first move on over to the ledge of this wide road.‚Äù
All I could do was proceed continuously speaking a Name and
Title. I wanted to wake up so badly. The fear was overwhelming.
How could this be? Long ago, I argued that this place did not exist,
but now, here I was. Seeing became believing.
Following the foul beast, we both walked out onto the broad barren
road, away from the cubes towards what appeared to be a cliff-like
ledge, dropping into emptiness. We passed several lone, peculiar
creatures roaming about. Passing these, we reached the road‚Äôs
edge.
Looking up and down, it seemed as if I were in the middle of a
spiral staircase. Above was a winding, ascending spiral, and below a
descending one as far as the eye could see. In the middle was a
doughnut hole of space, like the inside of a pit.
In awe, I watched bizarre beings moving through this space as if
being lifted by some strange force, while others appeared to be
climbing translucent, vaporous beams. Upon the roadway, hoards of
peculiar entities moved in loose packs. One such pack came and
encompassed us.


There, surrounding us on every side, were creatures both small
and great in stature. Their features were ferocious, yet soft, then
hideous, and then deceptively gentle. Some resembled animals, a
few looked snake-like, many appeared almost human, and others
were similar to serpents with round heads, sinewy arms, and short,
lizard-like legs.


These were strange beings. Several looked almost human but had
three faces on the orb of their head. Each face continuously revolved
horizontally round and round. With every rotation, their facial
features meshed with fluttering appearances into the next. Their
eyes were dark and deceptive. They all varied in colors and hues.
One particular creature, standing off in the distance, had skin with
a purplish, glowing, light-blue tone. It had three faces like the others
had, but it was stunningly beautiful. The faces slowly orbited around
the orb of its purplish head. I could not tell if it was manlike or not
due to a concealing garment it wore around its body. It was out there
watching in sullen silence, motionless, just staring at me while
emitting a purplish-blue aura.
I saw several milling around us that appeared like ‚Äúwalking stick‚Äù
insects with human-like faces about onethird of the way down their
body. Other creatures reminded me of tree trunks and plants with
human characteristics.


Many of the apparitions gathered around us appeared like
gargoyles without wings. These varied in height from a few inches to
around five feet tall. The colors of these creatures‚Äô skin all varied in
dark hues. Every one of the gargoyle entities wore odd-looking pants
from the waste down. Some wore robes.
All around me were a vast array of odd beings of diverse shapes,
and on the road lived small creatures that resembled worms. As I
watched these creatures, they at first looked harmlessly pleasant,
but then, as I stared, I saw them transform into hideousness before
my eyes.


The entities with the rotating faces seemed tallest. Lengthwise the
snake and serpent-shaped ones appeared longest. The ‚Äúwalking
stick‚Äù creatures varied in size and length. It was an incredible sight.
A costume designer for a horror movie would be gravely perplexed
to recreate this scene
The noise from this place was incredible, the smell, sickening. The
sights were mesmerizing. I stood, adapting to this place with all its
creatures lurking about. I slowly began to realize that this hissing,
human-lizard-like ghastly being was showing me around this domain
as a guide would a tourist at a seaside resort, but this was not a
resort.
It looked at me and said, ‚ÄúTurn to the walls and look upon the
stacks of boxes, each upon a row, and row upon row; stacked six
high they go along the road and as far back as they can go. Inside
are souls with many friends for each; yes, some friends leave while
others like to stay with our guest. The levels of this spiral way spin
thither and yon, descending lower where the blessings grow. Come
and see; granted thee. Come follow me back to where the boxes
grow.‚Äù
In a limping fashion, this fiend dragged its ugly feet along, creating
weak puffs of dust as we headed back toward the front ranks of
cubes located across this wide expanse of ugly terrain. Reaching
these, the creature came to the border where two cubes met and
walked between them without effort into some sort of secret
passageway.


In like manner, I followed. As I entered, the cube‚Äôs walls eerily
parted like ripples from a stone splashing in water. A path came into
view, revealing more cubes that lay behind the ones on the front row.
It was a maze of narrow hallways that lay beyond, leading to
cubicles further back. Cube after connecting cube were all pressed
tightly against these narrow passageways.
As I began to walk between these compartments, the bordering
walls would expand just enough for my body to rub uneasily against
it. While I moved, the walls would close in behind leaving me feeling
eerily claustrophobic. The walls felt warm and much like a dolphin‚Äôs
skin feels to the touch.
Walking between the cubes, I noticed that at different locations the
pathways would at one turn be pressed together, and at another turn
they would become narrow hallways; then, at another turn, small
wedge-shaped rooms appeared where the cubes did not press
tightly against each other. More narrow passageways led to the
farthest cells that lay against what appeared to be the back wall of a
pit located a great distance from the roadway.
Where we were walking, the floor was the same ugly brown dirt of
the road, and the ceiling was made up of the cubes stacked above.
The cubes were stacked six high. To go up or down to the next
highest or lowest cubicle, all one had to do was desire it and the
walls from the surrounding cells would morph, forming stairs that
reached the destination one wanted.


The host walked ahead of me. We walked between the cubes for
what seemed a long time. Inside every square cell resided a single
person along with several creatures. These creatures gave the
illusion of being people, animals, trees, and incredible things. Every
person was imprisoned in his or her own private prison. All were in
varying degrees of anguish, according to the deeds and actions
done in life, to life, against life, even for life, both the bad and the
good. Truly, this is a land best forgotten.


I could see into each cube in some strange form of double vision.
It was like viewing the cubicles from the outside, at the same time
seeing the inside of these abodes as one of its inhabitants saw it.
For reasons unknown to me how or why, the people and creatures
inside seemed to be a little less than two thirds of their normal size.
Odd!


We walked between and passed cube after cube, up and down.
Some were empty, but the vast majority had a person trapped inside.
If I looked up, there was a bottom view of a person‚Äôs wretched cell
and the events that were being enacted inside. Looking right to left I
saw more people living out scenarios once lived in mortal life, but
now with strange creatures as companions and props.
Turning to the right, I could see people enjoying their stay, but then
they would grow sullen because the scene never changed. Moving
on, I glanced and saw a woman dressed in dated garments of a
century gone by sitting, on a beach, mindlessly drawing circles in the
sand. Then we passed an old man trying to catch a fish in a pond. It
all looked so surreal. What had these people done to deserve such a
boring fate? Was not there supposed to be fire and brimstone here?
We traveled between more cubes. The sides of these eerily
rubbed against the texture of my skin. Everywhere I gazed, I could
not help but see people individually trapped inside. Each person lost
in the illusions that their personal prison portrayed.


There, in a cube, a young man resided who seemed to be
attending a costume ball. He appeared to be enjoying himself rather
well. Then the party guests began to cruelly ridicule him. Passing
this cell to the next, I saw another person being flogged on what
appeared to be an old sailing ship sinking in an ocean; just prior to
this he was enjoying being captain on that ship. We moved on.
Suddenly the sides of a cube formed stairs. The ugly host pointed
at the stairs and said, ‚ÄúCome, climb to the upper ones above.‚Äù
Ascending upward, we then emerged somewhere on the top sixth
row near the back wall. This level was different than the rest, reeking
of deception and quiet gloom. The floor here took on an ashen-grayburning-ember hue and masked the views of the people trapped
below. It was echoing quiet. All that could be heard were sounds of
many shuffling feet.
Before me lay a grand hallway that stretched into the distance
before ending. This hall was bordered on both sides by cubicles. The
ceiling arched upward cathedral fashion into the dirt roof of the pit.
Soiled green linen-like drapes, adorning the hall, often eerily rubbed
against me like unseen cobwebs concealed in shadows.
Down the long, semi-narrow corridor, I could see several large foul
beings quietly sitting upon a platform where a podium resided. From
my vantage point this cathedral walkway appeared shaped like a
sideways ‚ÄòT‚Äô with the podium‚Äôs stage marking the apexes‚Äô
intersection.


At the central apex, the hall branched out of sight towards the
back wall, while the other leg stretched straight onward before me.
Inside these halls, were sporadic groups of shadowy creatures
walking, huddled together, shoulderto-shoulder, and steadily
plodding past us. Each cluster glumly passed, vacantly starring
blindly ahead, never noticing we were there.
Separate groups would enter various cubes to my left, which were
pressed tightly against the back wall, and then vanished from view.
These gaggles were arriving from the apex up ahead, turning either
right or left, while the large, foul beings watched these processions
mutely plod on from the podium area.
Then, I spied that purplish-aqua-blue entity prowling in the dim
gloom. As soon as I saw it, I thought I could hear words faintly
whispering through the stark ominous silence of this great hallway
saying, ‚ÄúThe way is broad, enter here, enter there; it matters not
where. Enter here or enter there; it matters not how. Follow me here,
follow me there, it matters not where; just follow me here.‚Äù
The center apex of the hall drew closer. The grisly host before me
stopped, turned, grinned, and motioned for me to enter between
cubes to our right, back toward the road. As we proceeded, its loud
gnarly voice broke the hushed silence of this shadowy hall, saying,
‚ÄúSome enter here and are moved to where boxes grow. Others enter
there through spinning tubes where boxes wait. It matters not how,
as long as they keep entering this Grand Palace!‚Äù
We began descending morphing stairs till reaching the bottom row.
A labyrinth of right and left turns soon greeted our strides. Abruptly,
we emerged from between two cubes back onto the spiraling
roadway.


Walking between these was like a foretaste of things to come and
prepared my senses to comprehend what lay ahead. Standing a few
feet from me, this beastly host creature leered at me, as it stood
stone-like on the wide, dusty road. Its foul-smelling breath was
distorting its face. It seemed as if it had many eyes moving in a
kaleidoscope of scathing eyeballs. Leering. Staring. Scathing.
Glaring.


**EXCERPT 4:**


Walking along on the fifth story of cubes was a new nightmare.
Seeing those termed as ‚Äònice‚Äô confined here had shaken me.
However, with each passing scene the ‚Äònice‚Äô were in reality quite
different than first perceived. Many diverse desires corrupted their
lives. Some desires seemed noble and good. Other desires were just
plain bad. No matter, they all corrupted.
That uniquely arrogant, condescending, asserting-your-rights-nomatter-
the-cost attitude brought many here. This desire unknowingly
deceived and defiled scores of victims. Many used this as an excuse
to slay those they viewed as weak, according to their own twisted
opinions. When encountering any person perceived as a potential
threat, or not meeting their preconceived standards, they sought to
slay careers, marriages, hopes, and dreams of anyone they saw as
not fit.


This attitude was carried over at home, at play, and everywhere
they went. If you failed to live up to their predetermined standards,
you were marked as prey to be taught a lesson, or targeted for
abuse. It comes in many forms, from gossiping slander to creating
scapegoats; all in order to rule others‚Äô lives like a king or queen, and
then hope to be perceived by others as something great for their own
ego‚Äôs reward.
Cube after cube were passed by. There, inside a cubicle, a man
from 1890 who gave to the poor only to be seen by others, so he
could be exalted as being something great. He went about claiming
how vast his giving was, just to earn accolades from the masses. He
was a true hypocrite claiming other wealthy persons should pay their
fair share, because he paid a mere pittance from his immense net
worth.


He neglected those he employed, paid them low wages, and only
through his corporation‚Äôs profits did he give to the poor. Now he was
encapsulated in a cube as a beggar begging for bread while a crowd
of people passed him by, spitting on him as they went.
Across form this cell was another man from days gone by, who
was wedged inside a barrel that was jammed inside a narrow cave.
This man was stingy with the things given during life. He was being
deprived of the things he once horded. Creatures chained to the floor
of his habitat would place certain items before his face that would aid
his escape. He could not reach these because his arms were
immobile, stuck tight by his sides, unable to move.


Then we passed a woman, washing clothes upon a rock in a
muddy stream wearing the garments of Africa. Despite being pious
and performing nice deeds, she was caught up in pride and greed.
She envied her neighbor‚Äôs goods, complained a lot, and spoke badly
about a young woman she did not really know because she thought
she looked more beautiful than her. She perceived her as weak and
in need of a lesson that only she could teach. How dare this one try
to take her place in the community! She would put a stop to that, and
nip it in the bud!
She never really knew this other woman, but that did not matter.
She perceived her a threat to her status and continually slandered
the woman‚Äôs excellent character. The other woman turned the other
cheek after each libelous attack. This was viewed as weakness. She
was like a cat toying with a wounded mouse. She told herself that
she was just trying to teach that woman a lesson, but in truth it was
only a grudge justified to slay: to remove one more beautiful than
she.


Down by the stream stood a creature imitating the beautiful
woman that she reviled without cause, telling her the things she once
reasoned true but now found a lie. She became the mouse. The
creature, like a cat, began to play. We moved on, leaving this scene.
What one sows is what one reaps.
People inhabiting this fifth row of cubes were all mixed together.
This row did not class people together with common anguishes or
punishments. In fact, no level really did. However, the sixth row
reeked of something different waiting above. You could not help but
feel an ominous sensation radiating down onto you. The sixth row
was reserved for certain types of people, and we were on our way
there.


Walking behind the ambling lizard-like being, I came to another
square cell on the fifth row high, where resided a cruel woman who
had died in the 1950‚Äôs, full of malice, being beaten with a hairbrush
as she used to do to her children. She used to speak vilely to her
children, and then used a hairbrush to bring home some arbitrary,
meaningless point. She also tormented her husband in many diverse
ways.
What she once did to others was now happening to her. It was
easy to clearly see why these cruel people were here. Feeling waves
of apprehension, the others along these passageways still troubled
me because they appeared nicer than the cruel people were, and yet
they were here. One minute, I felt I understood why they all were
here in this place, and in another, I was not so sure. It was like
something following me was causing uncertainty.
As I felt this, I tried to remember the montage of words spoken to
me from above hoping they would provide aid again. The host
creature interrupted my attempt for relief by yelling furiously, ‚ÄúCome
on ‚Äì come on, hurry up! Curse God, curse me ‚Äì how can this be?
How can a Most High leave all the nice people in boxes? Crying?
Hurting? Come on Curse God ‚Äì curse me. How can a Most High let
this be?‚Äù


This foul beast motioned to move on. I followed this creature along
the maze of narrow halls between cubes. It seemed like we were
heading toward the far back wall. The further we went back, the
passageways became wider and the triangular rooms more
numerous.
We came to another open area with a limited view of the ominous
sixth row high. Sitting along the edges of what would be the roofs of
the cubes located on the fifth row sat several creepy, shadowy
creatures of varied sizes. Many looked like gargoyles without wings.
Others looked harmless, beautifully sublime. All emanated devious
vibes. As the creatures saw me passing below them, they began to
discourse amongst themselves.
‚ÄúHow can the Most High leave people bound in famine?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah,
and tied to earthly plights beyond compare?‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget leaving
these to war.‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, floods that perish, storms that steal, how can a most high
leave these be?‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that must be mercy? HA! HA!‚Äù
‚ÄúAye, and then brought here to be with us?‚Äù ‚ÄúFair? Just? Ha!
Merciful? HA!‚Äù
‚ÄúYou, walking there, are foolhardy to think that mercy the Most
High has.‚Äù
‚ÄúCome on, come on, and hurry up down there! Curse you, curse
me you little foul fleet-footed twit!‚Äù
‚ÄúHa! Ha! Ha! You foolish, foul, fleet-footed fool! God creates
calamities and we reap the rewards! Fair, Ha!! Mercy! Don‚Äôt make
me laugh.‚Äù
Their mocking was intense. Fear began to return with each
battering I received from their words. All I could do was what I had
been doing, speaking two words fast, like the staccato from a
machine gun, ‚ÄúJesus Christ, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ!‚Äù and walk
the gauntlet of hate-filled creatures following the host into the
unknown.
I wanted to answer them but I dared not stop speaking those two
words. I wanted to curse them back, yell, to tell them to go away, but
I could not. Their cruel taunting words kept hammering away at me.
It was as though they could perceive my thoughts but not my mind
and I thought back hard:
‚ÄúHow could these beings say such matters? There were no
children here, nor any disabled by fault of reason. These creatures‚Äô
many devices cause wars. As for the earth, it lives and breathes as
designed. To be caught in one of its spasms seems more by chance
than folly. One must be ready for eternity‚Äôs call at any moment, is
what I see.
‚ÄúYes, God knows all. He gave us intelligence to reason. Could we
learn or be granted insight into where a calamity may next befall
either by technology, divine insight, or a combination of both? Is this
what was meant by man subduing the earth?
‚ÄúWe build the buildings that collapse, not God, and yet He receives
all the blame. Fair? No! And then, how dare they call me a foul, fleetfooted
fool?‚Äù


I wanted to yell this out loud and curse all these creatures, but I
felt oddly restrained to keep my mouth to myself and to continue
walking, following that host creature shuffling along in front of me. I
could hear many deep, raspy voices echoing in the halls.
‚ÄúYou Fool! You bleak-eyed twit! How dare you think?‚Äù
‚ÄúHa! Ha! Ha!‚Äù
‚ÄúNo answers and never find any.‚Äù ‚ÄúHa! Ha! Ha!‚Äù
I was becoming incensed with rage at these beings because of the
doubt they sow. Then the peaceful and powerful thoughts from
above returned, challenging the taunts, and strengthening my
wavering mind with quiet resolve with these words:
‚ÄúTrue, the earth is designed to move and breathe according to
need. When a spasm arises, redemption is in the design. God chose
us to choose Him, but will we?
‚ÄúWhen that tower fell so long ago, at Siloam, the question was not
in who made it fall, or why it fell, or if those afflicted were more guilty
than the rest, but rather raised the question of what type of
redemption really redeems?
‚ÄúYes, many read into events, accidents, diseases, earth calamities,
and assign blame and cause. That is easy to do. However, does this
type of redemption truly redeem?
‚ÄúHmmm, when calamity strikes, where would you be found? Aiding
the helpless? Comforting the afflicted? Doing nothing? Join in the
looting? Host an argument to find blame? What truly redeems?
‚ÄúYes, God chose us to choose Him, but will we? God squeezes
and fashions light by generating darkness; from this, God refines
harmony‚Äôs balance by initiating calamity. When calamity arises,
redemption is in the design. Aiding fingers need many hands.‚Äù
A brief silence filled the cavernous halls at the cessation of these
words. The authoritative thoughts caused more muffled mocking to
slowly intensify again. Soon, contemptuous scoffing resonated loudly
in the gloomy passageways, each voice agonizing over the subject
amongst themselves.


Then, the reptilian host suddenly stopped, turned and growled,
‚ÄúEnough, enough, hear no more. Up we go, follow me, the sixth row
high boxes wait; come, follow me, half the kingdom offered thee.
Come, follow me ‚Äì up we go.‚Äù
I did not want to go. The sixth row high from the road reeked of
doom. The walls of a nearby cell morphed into narrow stairs. The
creature went up. I traversed the ascent to the sixth row with great
trepidation. Upon reaching this height the venue changed. The
residences on this level still retained the ten-by-ten feet dimension,
but these were set differently than the other rows previously seen.
The walkway between these were wider and the triangle-shaped
chambers larger. The ceiling was the same ugly dirt as the spiral
road and roofs of the fifth-row cubicles were the floors here. The
flooring was no longer a transparent smoky tan color as seen before,
below, but now had an ashen-gray, burning-ember tinge.
The cubes bordering the road area spread back in a fan shape just
like on the other rows, but this extension ended a great distance
from where the wide road was located. You could tell that the cubes
packed tight, and fan like, led toward the spiral road.
The other cubes placed in ranks governed the direction to the pit‚Äôs
far wall. This was the only area where I had some sense of direction.
Also on this level were many individual cubes set apart from the rest.
The short saurian ogre was cursing everything. Its foul breath
reeked stale and hot in the viscose air. However, this was not air, as
we know it, nor was the act of breathing the same as how we
humans breathe. In fact, breathing was more like exhaling in a
manner that only served to support speech as long as you spoke,
and nothing else.


This diabolical escort began speaking: ‚ÄúEach step we take is a
take indeed on we go and on we go. Half the kingdom offered thee.‚Äù
Looking behind me, the creature stopped speaking and stood
stone still, pointing. I quickly turned. There in the near distance was
that purplish entity, its faces rotating round and round, each full of
seductive beauty and profound malice. I heard it speak.
‚ÄúWill thou follow me?‚Äù
I said nothing in reply except the words ‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù non-stop.
‚ÄúA Most High Author of all? How can He be truly just and perfect
and allow the things you have seen?‚Äù
It was hypnotic, the words it spoke: ‚ÄúAn offer given ‚Äì will thou
follow me? Curse God, come, follow me.‚Äù
My head felt dizzy. Doubts flooded my mind about God and all His
mercy and perfect justice. The reptilian host creature stood grinning
from ear to ear. I continued to mutter a name and a title louder:
‚ÄúJesus Christ, JESUS CHRIST!‚Äù At the loud mention of this Name
and Title that strange purplish being beguilingly vanished between
the cubes as though seeking pity for having received a great wound
to its smugness.


Immediately, as though nothing had happened, the rank host
began hobbling in the direction where the spiral road lay below. The
walkways between the cubes became narrow again. I could feel the
purplish creature‚Äôs presence receding in the murkiness, yet it
remained lurking in the distance for another chance to devour.
About this time I had the paradoxical sense that we were
approaching the bottom of a bottomless pit, but in reality we were
somewhere on the sixth row, six cubes high, located somewhere
along a spiral road in a land best forgotten but not left unseen.
The lizard guide continued onward, pointing to this cube and that. I
cannot adequately express the misery I saw inside these square
cells. Some people were mutilated; others sat in darkness or flames.
In one, I saw a man, a warrior of Mongolia from long ago,
experiencing terrible thirst while tied to the ground with what
appeared to be insects crawling on his personage, each bug taunting
him all the while: ‚ÄúYou put me here, now a tasty taste of your own
fun!‚Äù


I turned and looked into the cubicle opposite his, and there was
another man experiencing a battery of unkind words that continually
assailed his mind. He was an abuser during his mortal sojourn on
earth.
He beat his family quite often with words and at times with fists.
He derived great pleasure from this, as it made him feel good and in
control. He told his sons and daughters, ‚ÄúYou are scum; you‚Äôll never
amount to nothing! Do as I say boy (with an upraised hand). Woman
‚Äì what did you do with my pants! How dare you ‚Äì you witch.‚Äù
These words were now coming back to haunt him. He sat on a
brown sofa in a room with algae green curtains that were opened,
exposing a sliding glass door. He sat with the sun to his back,
drinking what appeared to be a glass of beer, but in fact it was
nothing at all except a prop. There he was, while invisible voices
assailed his mind. He remained seated with an all-consuming anger
in his eyes, listening to the words he once spoke over and over
again, but now each word was returning to him.
During my stay in this place, I always heard the cubes click at
certain times. Each timed tick would be followed by a click, and the
cubes would move and ever so slowly began descending to new
levels located somewhere below.


As the cubes moved, torments increased, and the scenes inside
the cells changed for those trapped inside. On the sixth row high,
when the cubes moved we also moved, just as we did on the
proceeding levels below. Here on this row, it felt as though I was
approaching the bottom of a bottomless pit, yet I was still six cubes
high, off the road that lay somewhere out of sight.
I witnessed a nightmare of events as we traveled along these
passageways. Every person that I saw inside his or her cube was
living in his or her own private night terror. Each person‚Äôs worst
nightmare had become a reality. The most violent and cruel received
various forms of mutilations, while others were experiencing mental
torments which they had personally devised for others in their time
on earth. As the cubes moved, torments increased by degrees.
There was such despair, hopelessness, and extreme loneliness
here. The weeping was like one long, droning sound. Isolation was
the common factor for all, and separation from God was very
pronounced. I noticed that so many of these people had simply
accepted their fate, while others cursed God, cursed the creatures
that appeared to them as companions, and cursed themselves.
I saw men and women trapped in cubes that reeked of despairing
gloom and deep darkness. Some appeared to be in houses that
were decorated like the ones they once lived in. Still there were
others bound, unable to move, while buglike creatures crawled in
and out of their mouths. The people were shouting, ‚ÄúNo! This can‚Äôt
be happening! I want to wake up!‚Äù


Another cube passed, and inside were several creatures strapping
a man clad in ancient Roman garb to a cross and driving short
spikes into his wrists and near the ankles. He was once a soldier, a
leader of men of battles fought long ago. He had ordered many to be
crucified along a road. Here he was now, as he had once done; now
it was done to him over and over again, feeling all the pain fresh and
new each time.
Over there I saw a woman who had claimed to be a real witch in
the 1890‚Äôs. She was trapped inside a coffin. She would scratch the
inside trying to get out, and still could see herself on the outside
looking in while shadowy figures stood outside mocking her. It had
been her worst nightmare during her earthly life. She had dreamed
this often, but now it was real. She was cruel toward those who tried
to love her, and here it was being repaid in kind. Her cube clicked
and moved, and we moved along with it. The scene changed.
The coffin opened. She sat straight up, screaming hateinspired
terror at everything that moved.
Every lost soul in this place was experiencing degrees of severe
isolation, loneliness, gloom, boredom, and despair. It was as if these
people became totally resigned to his or her fate. It was though the
anguishes seen here were being given back in full measure, to each
according to every unkind word spoken, every slanderous lie told, all
filthy thoughts relished, all covetousness practiced, every hidden
dirty passion that had been enjoyed; every foul deed‚Äôs motives were
completely exposed, totally without excuse.


There seemed to be a whispering ambiance in the air that
sounded like a gentle wind rustling leaves in the twilight of a summer
evening, and was speaking something like this to all the inhabitants:
‚ÄúYou, in here, chose to walk away from the only way, even though
many times you were called to restrain and return; you refused. Look
at what you made of your life, and what you did. How can you
remain and continue to defile the holy way provided?
‚ÄúOne with an intellect and reason has responsibilities, and to force
you to change now is impossible. Why? Could it be because your
intellect and reason would continually pervert the change, renewing
detestation toward God if consequences do not last?
‚ÄúJust because you were given the gift of a living mind granted
latitude to reason with intelligence, you, here, find fault with
judgment? What was given as a gift, life, cannot be taken back once
sealed by eternity‚Äôs ways. If so, what was done before would remain
and a gift would no longer be a gift as originally consigned.
‚ÄúHow can the Most High change your reason here, from this, if you
failed to heed then? To change your intellect and reason now would
make you like a lowly beast, or a slave, who serves out of fear and
hates those above due to perceived resentments. How do you think
that one before was found to have iniquity in his heart, and what this
means?


‚ÄúIf you were allowed to be free from these torments, after serving
some time here, in a thousand years you would return to your ways
knowing you would just be punished, serve a little time, and be free
again. No justice in that.
‚ÄúYou, here and there, say blast me off into an eternal nothingness!
To do so would be against the nature provided by the Most High. He
cannot curse His own being that cannot help but breathe life.
‚ÄúThere are many who desire this type of destruction, but life
cannot beget death of the kind that breeds eternal nothingness.
However, it is not impossible to do this, but again that would be
against the nature of all things consigned. What does it matter when
the matter was decided to be a matter of fact?
‚ÄúYou, in here, perverted life‚Äôs free gifts, and changed it all just to
suit personal cravings and desire. You kept the wrong life, live. You
neglected family, fostered envy, slew people with your words, sought
to be king of the hill, thought you knew what was best, brought
others low deemed as unfit. You, in here, made life ugly where you
were assigned by all manner of means to rationalize your selfish
gratifications.


‚ÄúYou, there, rejected the chance to escape this fate and gleefully
accepted the free ride that falsely promised to turn stones to bread,
turn every perceived want and desire into some form of power that
was perceived as just a ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù, and promised that you were
exempt from all the calamities you created during your mortal
sojourn.
‚ÄúYou challenge by saying that if God truly was allpowerful and
merciful, He could change those down here with the wave of His
hand. How can one really change your mind now if you would not
freely listen then? You would learn to view this as a spanking, just
temporary punishment, to make you behave for a while, but then you
would return to your own vomiting reason every few thousand years.
Corruption would only beget more corruption unless restrained,
confined, here.‚Äù


This quiet ambiance‚Äôs gentle rustlings stirred many inside their
cubes to curse God, themselves, the creatures; but it also caused
them to understand and accept their fate, while awaiting a future
judgment‚Äôs final verdict‚Äôs decree, and then‚Ä¶?",09 May 2024 14:20:07,reddit

# The Science Behind Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic

A scientific breakthrough has shown a new and unknown cause of stubborn belly fat. The new alarming cause of belly fat will surprise you. If you have struggled with losing weight with little success or lost a bit and gained more later, the cause could be a new discovery.

Two scientific studies carried out in 2024 discovered one common issue in all overweight individuals, men or women. According to the studies, the new cause of stubborn weight gain and belly fat is the failure to enjoy quality sleep. Scientific studies have shown that all skinny individuals have deep and full nights of sleep.

Studies from Yale and Harvard have shown that lack of quality sleep causes negative results rather than making you feel rested. These studies have found that a lack of healthy sleep is more dangerous than smoking.

You may also think you are having a healthy sleep, but later find out that your body may not enjoy the deep restorative sleep required to maintain a toned physique and healthy weight. According to research, optimal sleep makes burning fat effortless and easy. Lack of quality sleep slows metabolism and speeds up aging and hunger.

# Key Ingredients

Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic features a unique combination of scientifically proven superfoods to address the underlying issues associated with unexplained weight and failure to have deep, restorative sleep. Some of the major ingredients of Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic:

**Hops (Humulus Lupulus)**

Hops are dried flowers with a bitter and grassy taste. It is the major ingredient in malts and beer. Hops have been used in traditional medicine for years because of their potential health benefits. It also supports healthy digestion, deep restorative sleep, and healthy digestion.

Studies have shown that hops may help people lose weight. A study involving 30 individuals taking hops-based supplements for three weeks twice daily significantly helped reduce hunger feelings. The supplement made them feel fuller by supporting the body to produce hormones that reduce appetite, like cholecystokinin (CCK), Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and Peptide YY (PYY).

**Valerian Root**

Valerian roots are plants that feature white and pink flowers. The plant is native to Asia and Europe but also in North America. Valerian root is used to make various forms of medicine, including pills, teas, and tinctures. The medicinal herb has been used over the years to treat insomnia and address sleeping issues. However, further research is required to back several studies claiming a mild sedative effect exists.

Studies suggest that the anxiety-reducing elements associated with valerian root may be due to the valeric acid. A preliminary study has shown that valerenic acid had anti-anxiety effects and also did not bind with benzodiazepine receptors found in the brain. According to the research, the receptors may be the underlying cause of benzodiazepine addiction.

Additionally, valerian root helps reduce the hot flashes in women in their menopause. A study revealed that taking the medicinal herb root helped reduce the frequency and severity in menopausal people. Hot flashes lead to rapid heartbeat, sudden warmth, and sweating, which some women in this stage in life find uncomfortable. The hot flashes result from hormonal changes. It also helps reduce premenstrual symptoms (PMS), which may cause food cravings, anxiety, mood swings, and depression.

**Spirulina Blue**

As the name suggests, this is a form of blue-green algae rich in nutrients. Consequently, it is considered a superfood and has been a food source for years, especially in Mexico, the U.S., and a few African countries. The blue-green algae has also been a key ingredient since the 1970s. Today, the ingredient comes in powder, tablet, and capsule form. I

Spirulina contains vitamins and protein, which makes it a perfect dietary supplement for individuals on vegan and vegetarian diets. According to research, it has inflammation-fighting and antioxidant properties and can control the immune system.

**Berberine**

Berberine is a bioactive compound found in numerous plants, including Phellodendron, European barberry, goldenseal, Oregon grape, and goldthread. The plants containing the compound have for years been used to treat various conditions, from sores to infections. Berberine was first found in barberry and related plants over 3000 years ago, and since then, the bark, leaves, and stems have been used in different ways.

Although berberine is not a magic pill for weight loss, it may help with weight gain issues and weight loss of over 30 BMI (Body Mass Index). Two scientific studies found that taking berberine supplements for three months led to notable results in weight loss. The results may be a result of how the bioactive compound aids in controlling insulin and other hormones that help regulate fat cells in your body.

Berberine is also known to help lower blood pressure, which is associated with strokes and heart disease. Taking berberine consistently for weeks or months may help lower the diastolic and systolic blood pressure, which are the bottom and top readings of the blood pressure.

Additionally, it also promotes deep restorative sleep and a healthy cholesterol profile.

Hey all, I might be calling this too soon (as I know stabilizing a new tank takes time) but here goes:

Started up a new planted tank running just about 3-4 weeks now. Encountering what looks to be patches of blue-green algae, diatoms, buce transition melt and monte carlo transition melt. The concerning ones (other than the BGA), are the growth of the new monte carlo leaves.

They seem to be very small and growing sparsely upwards. Initially my photoperiod was 6h with C02 injection, three days ago I increased it to 130W for 8hrs, thinking that the lighting wasn't enough (as I read online that such monte carlo growth might mean a lack of lighting).

So the diatoms and BGA only started when I had to go overseas for 5 days during the 2nd week. I read online that I should fert for the days I was gone to make up for the absence, thus that is what I did.

Here's what I'm working with:

* 300L (80gal) tank
* Chihiros WRGB II lighting (photoperiod was 6hrs, now 8hrs)
* C02 reactor, bubble count is 4/sec
* APT root tabs in aquasoil
* APT 3 ferting (was underdosing by mistake at 6ml daily, realised yesterday it should be 9ml for tank size)
* No inhabitants yet

525,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/1cn6akz/difficulty_identifying_type_of_algae/,Difficulty Identifying Type of Algae.,"Hello, today when I was adding water to my Axolotl's aquarium I noticed an algae that was growing in the tank's filter as well as the hornwort directly in front of the filter. I am dealing with hair algae and black beard algae in this aquarium at moderate levels due to my immense amount of hornwort and my deep sand bed that is 3.5in in depth. The color of the algae is a mix of blue, green, and grey. The algae is also hard (in a way similar to encrusting saltwater algae) and crunches if I attempt to squeeze the algae in my fist. The individual strands of the algae are also larger compared to regular green hair algae and can be picked out individually. There has also been a noticeable change in the smell of the aquarium, it does not exactly smell bad or like septic, more like just unusual and neutral. I have not had blue-green slime/cyanobacteria algae before and this does not sound like it due to the hardness of the algae as well as the thickness of the strands. I was not sure if this was some rare form of freshwater calcareous algae since it is hard and thick as well as that my water is quite hard with a high pH. Does anyone have any idea of what this algae might be?

I have attached pictures of the algae, note that it is a bit dehydrated.

last update: 21 April 2024

**TL;DR-** you may want to experiment using low color temperature white lights rather than high color temperature white lights for growing some microgreens and try having the lights on 24 hours per day with the lower color temperature. A lower color temperature may allow you to run your microgreens at high lighting levels for greater photosynthesis. 200-400 uMol/m2/sec is the norm for most microgreens, but some of the papers below show mixed results and promote using a lower PPFD and I've seen commercial growers promote around 100 uMol/m2/sec. Most people's hobby grow ops I see online are likely growing at a lower PPFD.


Although I'm only an amateur grower and experimenter when it comes to microgreens (I have far more experience with cannabis), I did take the time to skim over about 30 peer reviewed papers on the subject of microgreen lighting that are linked below, and I do know the technical aspects of the theory along with almost three decades of indoor growing experience. I'm merely offering some opinions here as it pertains to microgreens.

This YouTube channel has done far more light testing with microgreens than I have done:

* [On The Grow YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2k7Bw5IFTFM&list=PLkEXI0BumyG65lr9VELHbGy5JITMJd0Uv) --he points out very well how light geometry makes a difference. 

_______________________________

**Be careful of assumptions**

A major issue with making broad statements about very optimal microgreen lighting is that you're dealing with a variety of different plant species: radish, basil, pea etc. With cannabis for example, you're dealing with a single species, and even then different cultivars can have different optimal results in light quantity (the PPFD) and light quality (the SPD or spectral power distribution i.e. the specific wavelengths). Even the optimal photoperiod can be different with different cannabis cultivars according to the very latest research.

This higher variety notion can be magnified even further with microgreens because the same species of a microgreen can have different cultivars with very different optical characteristics in their leaves e.g.- sweet basil with green leaves and purple basil with purple leaves due to the very high anthocyanin content. Another example would be the red radish cultivars versus the green ones. Different cultivars can also have different specific light sensitive protein expressions (although not a microgreen, different tomato cultivars can have very different reactions to light particularly the photoperiod, as an example).

Don't assume that all microgreens have the same optimal lighting conditions.

Don't make assumptions about your light intensity- get a light meter down at canopy levels using a light meter that is cosine corrected and that has a remote sensor head, and not a potentially unreliable phone app.

Don't assume that you can grow hemp microgreens which can be legally problematic without a license in many states in the US like Nevada, even with the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. It costs several thousand dollars to get fully licensed to grow hemp in Nevada and I don't know how the state mandated harvest report would work with hemp microgreens. I believe Arizona has a maximum 14 day old hemp seedling standard for microgreens.

Don't assume a commercial grower actually understands lighting theory. I have yet to meet anyone IRL outside a plant growth lab and very few people online who understand the technical aspects of the theory. I have seen ""experts"" promote certain wavelengths for plants of pigments only found in algae, for example. 

______________________________

**Light intensity and measurement**

In horticulture the light intensity is the PPFD (photosynthetic photon flux density) measured in micromoles of photons per square meter per second. I write it as uMol/m2/sec although it's often written as ¬µmol m-2 s-1. With white light, and white light only, we can use lux instead of uMol/m2/sec **(1) <---read the notes below**. For a white light with a CRI of 70 or 80 we can use 70 lux = 1 uMol/m2/sec and be within 10% true all of the time of a quantum light meter (assuming both meters are properly calibrated). With modern phosphors using 73 lux = 1 uMol/m2/sec and be within 5% most of the time.

For a CRI 90 white light we can use 63 lux = 1 uMol/m2/sec and be within 10% all of the time and 65 lux = 1 uMol/m2/sec to be within 5% most of the time. For the sun we use 55 lux = 1 uMol/m2/sec. To be noted, most professional quantum meters claim no better than 5% absolute accuracy although the good ones I've measured were closer to within 1% as measured with my spectroradiometer. Cheap quantum light meters like the $150 one by Hydrofarm can be a crapshoot due to the sensor used (horrible design!), and the cheap LightScout meters can be problematic from an even different type of sensor used although they will be good enough for white light for non-scientific use. Based on my testing, I would not trust cheap quantum light meters for color LEDs or blurple lights.

For common measurements I use the Apogee SQ-520 for PPFD and the Extech 401025 for lux. For complex measurements I use a Stellarnet Greenwave spectroradiometer.

I have an article on using lux meters instead of quantum light meters for white light with the theory of why we can do this accurately enough:

* [Using a lux meter as a plant light meter](https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/17nxpy/using_a_lux_meter_as_a_plant_light_meter/)

Due to cosine correction errors, unknown sensor errors depending on the specific phone, and the way that people tend to tilt their phone back when taking a reading, I do not recommend using your phone as a light meter no matter what app you may be using. You can get proper lux meters *with a remote sensor head* starting at $20-$30, and particularly as a professional or heading in that direction, it's irrational not to have a proper light meter when growing plants. Know your PPFD! Don't use lux meters with the red/blue ""blurple"" lights- that is a case where you want to use a proper quantum light meter unless you know the lux to uMol/m2/sec conversion value.

I have been generically using 200 uMol/m2/sec (around 15,000 lux) with microgreens but a review of the literature below shows that a higher PPFD may be more optimal for both yield and phenolic content. A lot of those papers below are showing around 300 uMol/m2/sec (around 22,000 lux) may be more optimal depending on the microgreen or even around 400 uMol/m2/sec for some microgreens like basil. Few if any papers promote 500 uMol/m2/sec and above for any microgreen and some promote in the 100 uMol/m2/sec range.

To me it never made sense to have any periods of darkness when growing any vegetative plant but in most plants we are not trying to grow with elongated stems so microgreens are a special case. With some microgreens we want a very elongated stem with very small and immature leaves.

For the 24/7 in vegetative growth argument, generally speaking crop plants don't get ""tired"" and need to ""sleep"" in a vegetative state unless perhaps grown at a very high PPFD. This can be demonstrated by measuring the net photosynthesis rate by measuring the amount of chlorophyll fluorescence a plant gives off (1-2% of the light absorbed by a plant is readmitted as far red light, the amount depends on the PPFD and how efficient photosynthesis is working in the plant). I can measure the amount of chlorophyll fluorescence using my spectroradiometer or by using a large area silicon photodiode with a far red filter with a high precision, high sensitivity bench top multimeter (Rigol 3068).

Below is an example of a shot off my spectroradiometer measuring far red chlorophyll fluorescence to measure photosynthesis efficiency. In this case I was seeing how long it takes radish microgreen to ""wake up"" (30-60 seconds from darkness) and ""go to sleep"" (3-5 minutes from lights on). Different lighting spectra can give a slightly different signature depending how far the light penetrates the sample leaf. I can use this technique to see how much light a plant can ""handle"" short and long term (there are also other techniques like measuring the photochemical reflectance index).

* [chlorophyll fluorescence over a few minute period](https://imgur.com/a/GllEWOJ) --this is the far red light being emitted by a plant and is radish microgreens ""waking up"" in this case. Each line represents 2 seconds. The greater the chlorophyll fluorescence at a given PPFD the lower the photosynthesis efficiency. It takes time for certain enzymes involved with photosynthesis to be activated when the lights first turn on.

So generally speaking, running the lights 24/7 is fine for most plants we grow as far as photosynthesis.

To be noted, it is important that microgreen trays have an even PPFD so there is even stem stretching which is a compelling reason to use tube style lights.

SAG tip: if you see people throw around specific wavelengths for photosynthesis, they probably are not understanding how photosynthesis works by wavelength. If you see someone saying you need certain wavelengths for specifically chlorophyll A and B then that is most definitely a red flag and they are likely misunderstanding *relative* absorption charts for chlorophyll dissolved in a solvent at a relatively low chlorophyll density, rather than how leaves actually work that have a very significantly higher chlorophyll density. The notion that certain wavelengths are needed for photosynthesis simply is not true and all of PAR (400-700 nm) can drive photosynthesis. See this article for the theory:

**The lighting spectrum**

One of the grow goals of many microgreens is long stems. What many people will do is have a period of etiolation (complete darkness) in the beginning of the grow cycle or long periods of darkness each day which encourages acid growth (cellular elongation or stem ""stretching"") which is different from growth through photosynthesis. Acid growth is basically where the cell walls loosen up and are able to fill up with water. A lower PPFD and lower levels of blue light as a ratio of light also causes this stretching. We don't neccessarily gain any dry yield with increased acid growth beyond increased acid growth also cause leaves to be bigger (and thinner) and thus have a greater light capture area for greater photosynthesis in the individual microgreen, but we will gain a lot more wet yield and that's important with microgreens, particularly if the focus is on having longer stems.

Blue light typically has the greatest effect on plants as it pertains to acid growth through the cryptochrome and phototropin protein groups. Far red light can cause additional acid growth through the phytochrome protein group.

* [wiki link to ""acid growth hypothesis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid-growth_hypothesis)

Any discussion on the shape of the plant brought on by light like extra stretching/acid growth gets into *photomorphogenesis* and how the above mentioned light sensitive proteins are being expressed.

* [wiki link to ""photomorphogenesis""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photomorphogenesis) --I'm so glad this wiki entry was cleaned up and made more accurate

This is what a typical blue action response chart looks like for blue light by the specific wavelength. It's sometimes called the ""three finger action response"" response in botany. Remember, this is not a photosynthesis chart:

* [blue three finger response](https://imgur.com/a/n0IjO71)


An issue is that most people are using lights with a very high CCT which has a high amount of blue light **(2)**. Blue light generally suppresses acid growth the most and suppresses overall photosynthesis rates a bit in most, but not all, modern peer reviewed articles on photosynthesis rates by different wavelengths. We can see this in the McCree curve where blue light has a lower photosynthesis rate than red light or even 550 nm middle green light **(3)**. 


To me it never made sense to use a very high color temperature like 6500K to grow most microgreens because the relatively high 30% or so blue light component may be working against your goal of having longer stems and larger leaves **(4)**. Higher lighting levels also decrease acid growth/stem elongation which is the argument that by having a lower color temperature light that increases stem elongation, we can negate the effects of the higher lighting levels i.e. lower color temperature with less blue at a higher PPFD may be optimal for greater yield while still keeping the stems longer.

To illustrate this point I have some pictures below of radish and peas grown at a PPFD of 200 uMol/m2/sec with the lights on 24/7 for maximum daily photosynthesis rates (a DLI of about 17 mol/m2/day). 

If you grow with red/blue ""blurple"" light instead of white light, you may want to choose a blurple light that has lower amounts of blue light if you want longer stems. Blurple has no green light and green light acts the opposite way than blue light on plants, so it may be worthwhile to use lower amounts of blue to get more stretching (some academics have speculated of unknown green light receptors in plants but I think the blue light proteins are simply reversible like the red/far red phytochrome proteins are).

I've seen a lot of people promote 6500K because it's closer to natural sunlight. That's a bad argument known as ""appeal to nature"". For example, natural sunlight also has a lot of far red light which will lower anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. A lot of studies coming out show that far red will also reduce yields in some plants. If one wants to appeal to nature then why aren't they also using high amounts of far red light at a red to far red ratio close to 1:1 like it is in nature? There is nothing natural about indoor growing under artificial light sources.

BTW, all white lights are ""full spectrum"" by definition of having adequate red, green and blue light components. Blurple lights are not ""full spectrum"" because they don't have green light. It could be the case that people who use the term ""full spectrum"" are also including some far red and a bit of UV. It's not a recognized industrial term as per ANSI/ASABE S640 and more of a marketing term, so take it for what it is.

**pics of some results**

To be clear, this is not exactly a peer reviewed study I'm doing, and I'm only showing a few pics to illustrate a point, not to make hard claims. My plant count is not high enough to make hard claims nor would I make hard claims using single small grow containers, nor do I have proper climate controlled grow chambers. 

All microgreens I grow are normally at a PPFD of 200 uMol/m2/sec. They are grown with the lights on 24 hours per day with an ambient temperature of 75-80 degrees F and a relative humidity of around 20% in the Mojave Desert (you absolutely can grow microgreens in low humidity environments with experience and proper technique). My CO2 levels tend to be around 700-800 ppm when I'm home.

This is what the grow setup looks like with six, 2 gallon ""space buckets"" that each have a unique LED configuration (the dark one lower right is actually pure UV-A). Different wavelengths, different color temperatures, some can be pulsed. This allows me to brute force the problem in a relatively tiny area:

* [six buckets on a shelf](https://imgur.com/a/kb0llvs)

I have found that you can get a fairly straight line in the results for peas at 2000K, 3000K, 5000K and pure blue. 2000K had the longest stems and the largest leaves.

* [peas at various CCT and blue](https://imgur.com/a/m8UcQNA)

Radish was a little different in that 2000K gave the longest stems and the largest leaves but the difference between 3000K and 5000K was not as large. But 2000K is the way that I'd grow radish with how I grow. I let these get a little larger than radish microgreens should be.

* [radish at various CCT](https://imgur.com/a/cvzx3PU) --microgreen radish is not normally grown this big and you would not want to eat those shown

I prefer to grow microgreens with a lower CCT and there can be a significant difference between 2000K and 3000K white light in the microgreens I've played with. I prefer to have the lights on 24 hours per day. Your results may vary.

**What about adding far red light?**

Far red is tricky when it comes to plants. High amounts of far red light will definitely increase acid growth so you will get longer stems. Far red will also easily penetrate through leaves to hit the stems even when leaves block other light (far red is also highly reflected by leaves and ~10% far red is actually being absorbed in a single pass depending on leaf thickness). Far red *may* help drive photosynthesis in a phenomenon called the Emerson effect **(5)**.

Far red is well known to trigger the ""shade avoidance"" response in plants by increased acid growth through the phytochrome protein group. The shade avoidance response is simply additional acid growth.

* [wiki link to ""shade avoidance""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance#:~:text=Shade%20avoidance%20is%20a%20set,%2Davoidance%20syndrome%20(SAS)

The issue is that you need a lot of far red light to really trigger this response to get the extra elongation, and in some of my personal experiments, far red light may reduce the amount of anthocyanins and this is supported in the literature below. It's almost never the case that we want reduced anthocyanins and ""purple"" is its own selling point (particularly in cannabis and not just microgreens).

* [tomato seedlings example with and without far red](https://imgur.com/a/PMLz0Ch) --far red suppressed anthocyanins from forming in this case. We don't grow tomato microgreens due to the high alkaloid content in the leaves.

In this study below adding far red light decreased yields and phenolic levels. A lot of studies in plants are showing that far red has no effect on yields or reduces yields:

* [Adding UVA and Far-Red Light to White LED Affects Growth, Morphology, and Phytochemicals of Indoor-Grown Microgreens](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/14/8552)

Far red LEDs do have the potential to have a much higher efficacy than other LEDs and a theoretical 100% efficient 735 nm far red LED would have an efficacy of 6.14 uMol/joule.

As an aside, far red has been a bust so far for cannabis in the literature with lower yields, lower cannabinoid levels, and potential delayed flowering. It could be the case that the benefit of far red is at extremely high, outdoor sunlight  PPFD levels. 

____________________________

**Why not grow with no blue light?** 

This may work but you need to experiment with the *specific cultivar* to make sure that you get the results that you want. Blue and UV can trigger increased anthocyanin production to make the microgreens more red or purple which can be a desirable aesthetic characteristic. Blue and UV can also trigger chemicals to increase the aroma in many plants (increased phenolic compounds) which can be an argument against using lower CCT lights that have less blue light.

Furthermore, in many types of leaves you will not get normal growth without some blue light, and have unequal cellular expansion in the leaf veins and the rest of the leaf material, resulting in leaves that are ""crinkled"" and unnatural looking. You can see this if you grow many (all?) lettuce cultivars under pure green or pure red light and is sometimes called ""red light syndrome"" as used in botany. 

Although I've done pure green grows, a problem with green is that green LEDs themselves have a relatively low efficacy and efficiency known as the ""green gap"" in semiconductor physics. Nitride (blue) and phosphide (red) LEDs can be 80% and higher efficiency, but green lies in between those so the best efficiency right now is about 40% for some Cree LEDs and most are significantly lower. This translates to an efficacy of about 1.7 uMol/joule at best (remember that efficacy and efficiency conversion values are wavelength dependent).

* [Mind the (green) gap](https://www.newswise.com/articles/mind-the-green-gap) --University Of Illinois Grainger College Of Engineering

Green light generally has the opposite effect on plants than blue light from a photomorphogenesis perspective such as increasing stretching rather than reducing stretching. Green may also reduce anthocyanin and other photochemical byproducts but this gets into how you define green. In many papers, ""green"" is defined as 500 nm (cyan) to 600 nm (amber) and 501 nm ""green"" may have different results from 599 nm ""green"" particularly with anthocyanins. We can actually run into the same definition problem to a lesser degree with ""blue"" in papers.

The latest Samsung white LM301H EVO LEDs have an efficacy of 3.14 uMol/joule (about 2.9 uMol/joule system efficacy depending on the LED driver) and an efficiency of 86% for the highest bin, so it doesn't make engineering sense to use green LEDs for horticulture when it's better from an energy use perspective to use a blue LED with a phosphor for the green light component. T8 non-LED fluorescent lights, by comparison, have an efficacy closer to 1 uMol/joule and T5 tubes are only a little better. Just say no to old style mercury vapor tube fluorescent lights! 

_____________________________

**Should you grow with very high CRI lighting?**

No.

Very high (above 90) CRI lights have an additional deeper red phosphor(s) in the 660 nm range and a flatter lighting spectrum with shallower spectral dips that is closer to an ideal black body radiation source (which would be CRI 100). Most white LEDs use a 450 nm or so blue LED as the phosphor pump and all the rest of the light generated is through fluorescence of the phosphors. Very high CRI lights are less energy efficient.

If you want this deeper 660 nm or so red then you are better off from an energy consumption perspective to just use lower CRI lights and add 660 nm LEDs to the light source. The latest 660 nm red LEDs can have an efficacy of over 4 uMol/joules (low 80s% efficiency).

Having additional deeper red phosphors lowers the energy efficiency of the white LED by increasing the total Stokes shift (the difference between the 450 nm LED and the wavelength of the emitted light) in the white LED which is why higher CRI LEDs tend to run a bit hotter and have a lower efficacy.

You may want to use higher CRI lights where you prepare and serve food, though, because that extra deeper red will make colors look more natural and get red meats and red fruits/vegetables to ""pop"" in their appearance. Lower CRI makes colors appear dull and lifeless. Personally I think that low CCT but ultra high CRI lights can look a bit weird for general use (I have a 3000K CRI 97 DIY light by my bed).

*I generally recommend CRI 80 grow lights with additional red LEDs as needed.*

___________________________

**Gimmick lighting**

I have enough experience to be very skeptical with any gimmick lighting and plants. Anything outside normal upper light and side or intracanopy lighting I consider gimmick lighting.

One type of gimmick lighting that might be worth exploring for microgreens is having far red only lights on during the dark period if using a more traditional dark period rather than lights on 24/7. The idea here would be to try to boost acid growth greater than etiolation for more stem stretching. Far red may be able to drive low levels of photosynthesis on its own (the photosynthetic drop off with far red light is called ""red drop"" in botany).

Pure UV-A is really a no-go. I've experimented with pure UV-A and microgreens and you'll get less photosynthesis using LEDs that are less efficient and end up with dwarfed plants that give a lower yield. You'd have to experiment if you get a significant anthocyanin or phenolic compound boost. UV-A LEDs are also less electrically efficient than PAR (400-700 nm) LEDs.


UV is pretty well known for increasing phenolic compounds. One idea may be to grow with very low blue light and then add UV light in the last 24 hours to try to boost phenolic compound and anthocyanin levels.

Pulsed light is supported in some literature to boost yields 10-15% in some plants although the results in literature are mixed. Instead of say 200 uMol/m2/sec of continuous light, you may use 400 uMol/m2/sec of light at a 50% duty cycle switched at perhaps 500 Hz. They will give the identical DLI (mol/m2/day) but the higher pulsed PPFD could trigger a boost in some photochemical reactions in addition to greater potential yield....maybe.

Pulsed light could be taken a step further and maybe pulse blurple light during one part of the 50% duty cycle, and pulse far red during the other part of the 50% duty cycle, as an example. I have no idea what that would do and just throwing out ideas. I would do this at a much higher frequency like 100 KHz (even most COBs I've pulsed work at >300 KHz and would be junction capacitance limited).

_______________________________

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, I don't know what's best for you and your particular setup. A trend in the literature below supports around 300 uMol/m2/sec may be best for many types of microgreens. Yield per energy consumption may be best at a lower PPFD, though. For me to completely light profile a specific microgreen would take a few months in my setup because I more than have to try a bunch of spectral combinations, I also have to try various PPFD combinations, and I can only do six combinations at once at a lower plant count.

If I optimal light profile a particular microgreen how much greater yield or greater phenolic compound levels am I really getting? At what point is one just being pedantic? What are the established professionals doing?

But, it may be worth it to try experimenting using lower CCT lights like 2000K at a higher PPFD to get the stems to stretch more and to have larger leaves. This may allow you to run the lights 24/7 for greater photosynthesis and faster harvesting times. You have to weigh this against the possibility of lower anthocyanin and phenolic compound levels than higher CCT lights. You would have to experiment.

I do know that there is some dogma (an authoritative opinion or belief presented as a fact) when it comes to microgreen lighting and vegetative plant lighting in general that may not be true. 

Finally, in my opinion there is nothing special about 6500K lights for vegetative plant growth although this narrative is commonly pushed online.

**notes**

**(1)**

What is white light is its own article and actually a complicated subject. My definition is not going to be that same as another person's definition and different industries have their own standards. I *loosely* define a white light source as a light source that collectively emits light that is on or near the Planckian locus of the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram within a certain color temperature range, such as 2700K to 7000K. 

* [wiki link to Planckian locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planckian_locus)

For the purpose of this article, I also define white as 2000K although many people would agree that 2000K would be an amber light source, but to me amber is a specific wavelength range. Bridgelux has a ""white"" LED with a CCT of 1750K that I would not consider white.


Correlated color temperature (CCT) is essentially the red to blue ratio of a white light source with a lower CCT having more red light and a higher CCT having more blue light (green light has nothing to do with CCT). ""Correlated"" is used because the color temperature of the artificial light source is correlated to the temperature of a light emitting black body radiation source like an incandescent light bulb or the sun in the temperature unit of Kelvin. We normally don't use ""degrees"" with Kelvin like Celsius or Fahrenheit because it's an absolute temperature scale. It's a ""3000 Kelvin"" light and not a ""3000 degree Kelvin"" light, for example.

Color rendering index (CRI) is how well a light source makes colors look compared to a black body radiation source like the sun. Plants don't care about the CRI. The important thing to know, however, is that higher CRI lights have additional deep red light being emitted.

You can look at very high versus lower CRI and CCT charts here:

* [Bridgelux phosphor guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/HandsOnComplexity/comments/gr1rcf/bridgelux_phosphor_guide/)


**(2)**

The whole idea of 6500K for veg growth gets down to what is the highest color temperature that can be tolerated to be used in shop lights, warehouse lights and the like because the higher amounts of blue light helps with dynamic visual acuity and alertness. It's also close to an illuminant standard used in photometry (standard D) and about where red/green/blue have the same ratio.

6500K lights can be a little more efficient due to the lower amount of Stokes shift in the phosphor (less light is being emitted through fluorescence rather than be directly from the blue LED that is used as the phosphor pump).

There's nothing special about 6500K in growing plants. Quartz metal halides used to be used as HID lighting for plants that had a color temperature of around 4000K. 

As an aside, there's nothing particularly special about specifically 2700K lights in flowering other than we may want the reduced blue. 2700K is close to what incandescent bulbs are and why they are popular. HPS is around 2100K.

For modern cannabis growing, around 3500K is fairly typical as both a veg and flowering light, and 3500K CRI 80 is what I use as a standard control light.

(SAG tip for cannabis: if you have a separate higher CCT veg light and a lower CCT flowering light for cannabis, using the higher CCT light for the first two weeks of flowering will greatly help keep the cannabis plants more compact which can be important for tight growing spaces. In the HPS days, I'd encourage people to use metal halides for the first two weeks of flowering for cannabis)

**(3)** 

The McCree curve is only valid from a PPFD of 18-150 uMol/m2/sec and only for monochromatic light. There are papers to support that at a higher PPFD that green can drive photosynthesis greater than even red light due to red light becoming saturated on a leaf's surface while green light can penetrate and drive photosynthesis deeper in a leaf. In most leaves 80-90% of green light is being absorbed.

**(4)** 

This is close to the amount of blue light in a white light source:

* 2000K is about 3 or 4% blue

* 2700K is about 10% blue

* 3500K is about 15% blue

* 4200K is about 20% blue

* 6500K is about 30% blue

**(5)**

Far red (700-750 nm) light ""may"" increase photosynthesis rates by increasing photochemical efficiency. There are two photosynthetic reaction centers, photosystems 1 and 2. PS2 comes first in the reactions and electrons can get ""jammed"" up when going from the PS2 to the PS1. PS1 can be driven by far red light so a little far red light can help clear up this electron ""traffic jam"". This is essentially how the Emerson effect works if adding far red to PAR light. But, the question is how well does it actually work and there are mixed results in actual modern testing.

* [wiki link to ""Emerson effect""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_effect) --take the ""far higher"" photosynthesis claim with a big grain of salt

There has been a push to add far red in normal PAR (400-700 nm) measurements but this has not been adapted as an industry standard. I discuss this here:

also tiffany x lisa stuff

Lisa squinted as the summer sun filled her eyes, closing her car door with a dull thud. At John‚Äôs invitation, she had come to check on the orphanage he had recently started(‚ÄúTook a while, but it‚Äôs complete! Drop by anytime!‚Äù). He had mentioned the windows being coated with colorful plastic shapes and drawings that the children pasted on themselves. It must be pretty lively in there, she mused.

Yawning, she pinpointed its location immediately- its cheerful yellow walls stuck out like a sore thumb against the landscape, vividly contrasting the dreary gray of the neighborhood.

Lisa drew closer and knocked on the door thrice. There was the sound of children sprinting and shouting, followed by the door opening the tiniest bit and allowing her to view a sliver of the young face that answered. She frowned slightly, then plastered on a smile and squatted to meet the child‚Äôs eyes. ‚ÄúHey there, do you know where John might be?‚Äù

The boy then gave her a suspicious look and clutched at his cross necklace. ‚ÄúMommy said we shouldn‚Äôt open the door for strangers.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúWhy are you looking for him?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Lisa,‚Äù She said, stifling a laugh. ‚ÄúDid, uh- Mommy ever mention me? He invited me here.‚Äù

His expression brightened at her name, but the door didn‚Äôt budge an inch as he continued to inspect her face. ‚Äú...How do I know you‚Äôre the REAL Lisa?‚Äù The boy said, shooting her an accusing glare.

Before she could think of an answer, she heard another heavier pair of footsteps approaching, and the door suddenly opened wider to reveal a wrinkled face she recognized. ‚ÄúFather Garcia?‚Äù Lisa straightened up and shook his hand, noticing he was wearing a flowery pink apron. It clashes horribly with his outfit. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to see you! What are you doing here? Did John call you here as well?‚Äù

‚ÄúBuenos dias, hija,‚Äù Father Garcia greeted her, ruffling the boy‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúYou can go back in now, hijo.‚Äù He said.

‚ÄúCan I have a sweet?‚Äù The boy asked.

‚ÄúYou already had a lot today, no?‚Äù When he wilted, the older man chuckled. ‚ÄúPerhaps tomorrow, hijo.‚Äù

The boy ran back into the house, leaving room for Lisa to step into the building. Father Garcia moved toward what looked like the living room. ‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs out getting groceries, so I‚Äôm looking after the children. You can stay with us while you wait.‚Äù

Lisa obliged, stepping inside and closing the door with a faint click behind her. The building was modest, and the old furniture looked slightly worn down, yet the mood was unexpectedly warm and welcoming. Children were playing with toys, many of which she recognized from John‚Äôs younger years: the orange and gray toy truck, multicolored building blocks, and small figures made of plastic. The kids puppeted the yellow and red figures to make the tiny people fight over what seemed like a pink hostage, the battle being animated dramatically by the kids‚Äô onomatopoeia.

‚ÄúMake yourself at home,‚Äù Father Garcia grunted, tugging off the apron and hanging it on a row of hooks along the wall. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make us some coffee.‚Äù

Sitting down at the table, she soaked in the homely vibe the orphanage put out. It was warm and welcoming, even with the awkwardness of the children staring at the stranger. I‚Äôm guessing John never showed them what I looked like. The kids kept staring as she glanced around in a fruitless attempt to avoid attention.

After a few minutes, Father Garcia returned with two steaming mugs, a small jar, and two wooden spoons on an off-white tray.

‚ÄúSugar?‚Äù He asked. She shook her head and he shrugged, putting a few spoonfuls into his #1 Dad mug and stirring it lightly.

Lisa beamed. ‚ÄúYou seem to be doing well,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThis place is unrecognizable from the rat-infested dump it used to be.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have no idea, hija.‚Äù He chuckled and took a sip. ‚ÄúJohn put everything he had into this little house, you‚Äôd think it was a treasure trove full of gold.‚Äù

Looks like his sentimentality got the better of him, Lisa thought, drinking from her mug as well. An unpleasant memory drifted into her thoughts, one of her and John growing up in an orphanage where Sister Bell had cared for them. The nun had hidden her true intentions skillfully, so it came as a nasty shock to the staff when the kids were led like lambs to the slaughter into the cornfield surrounding the church.

Lisa and John were the only ones who survived, albeit cursed with the vivid memory of it all. She felt a chill run up her spine, and she took another drink from her cup in an attempt to combat the cold. I‚Äôm sure he doesn‚Äôt want anyone to go through what we did ever again‚Ä¶ and neither do I.

Father Garcia checked his watch. ‚ÄúHe should be back by now,‚Äù he muttered.

At that moment there was the sound of footsteps joined by the jingling of keys, and the door opened to reveal a black-haired figure weighed down by several paper bags of groceries. Lisa tried to greet him but was quickly cut off by the stampede of children rushing towards the door, all of them ecstatic about the return of their ‚Äòmother‚Äô.

‚ÄúMom! You‚Äôre back!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm hungry! What‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you buy any snacks? Vienna stole mine!‚Äù

‚ÄúDid not!‚Äù

‚ÄúDid too!‚Äù

John laughed and began weaving his way through the crowd of kids into the kitchen. Putting down the bags and washing his hands, he tried to soothe the mass of hungry kids. ‚ÄúNow, now, let‚Äôs all calm down, I‚Äôm not your moth- whoa!‚Äù

A boy Lisa recognized as the one who tried to interrogate her managed to jump into his arms, and he spun him around a few times before gently putting him down. ‚ÄúYou promised we could call you that until you found us one!‚Äù The child chirped. ‚ÄúAdults have to keep their promises!‚Äù

‚ÄúWelcome back, hijo.‚Äù Father Garcia said, smiling. ‚ÄúI have some errands I need to run, so I‚Äôll be off.‚Äù

They shook hands, and the old priest closed the door behind him.

‚ÄúJohn!‚Äù

He looked up. Upon seeing who it was, his face lit up in a grin. ‚ÄúLisa!‚Äù John waded quickly through the crowd and they caught each other in a hug, laughing.

‚ÄúThis is quite the crowd you have here,‚Äù Lisa remarked. Then in what she thought was a whisper, ‚ÄúQuick question, why do they call you Mom? You don‚Äôt look particularly girlish.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that?‚Äù A girl from the crowd chortled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because every time Mommy sees a spider-‚Äù

John nervously laughed and cut her off, suddenly embarrassed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt- don‚Äôt worry about it,‚Äù He whispered. She raised her eyebrows, and John cleared his throat in an attempt to change the subject. ‚ÄúEveryone, could I please have your attention? I‚Äôd like to introduce you to someone!‚Äù

The kids quieted down and peered up curiously at the blonde stranger.

He gestured to Lisa. ‚ÄúThis is Lisa Pearson, my childhood friend. You‚Äòll see her around if she decides to visit again, so please be nice!‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Lisa? She doesn‚Äôt look as pretty as I thought she was.‚Äù

‚ÄúShush, Mom is talking!‚Äù

‚ÄúYou shush!‚Äù

Lisa chuckled at their bickering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre honest at least,‚Äù She said, and John sighed.

He glanced at her. ‚Äú...Would you like to tell them a bit about yourself?‚Äù

But the children had broken into chaos once more, the air being filled with shrieks of mirth and blotting out what she was about to say.

She couldn‚Äôt help but smile. ‚ÄúThey are children, after all. Here, why don‚Äôt I help you make dinner instead?‚Äù

John returned her grin. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

\*\*\*

It was a peaceful moment between the two, cooking together and chatting about their lives like nothing had happened.

‚ÄúIt must‚Äôve taken some major renovation to make the place look so nice,‚Äù Lisa remarked. ‚ÄúThe little ones seem to love it here.‚Äù She peeled the last slice off a potato and threw it into a pot, filled it with water, and scraped the loose peels into a separate bowl.

Taking the pot, John moved it to the stove. Turning on the heat, he answered, ‚ÄúTook me and Father Garcia a good part of the year, but eventually, it was deemed good enough to house children by the government.‚Äù He took a large raw chicken from the fridge and placed it on a cutting board, starting to skin it. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think they would let me near kids after what happened last year.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey know you were innocent,‚Äù Lisa said indignantly, now chopping carrots. ‚ÄúThere was no evidence you killed Amy Martin, or that you‚Ä¶ did that to her face.‚Äù She shuddered at the thought. It was certainly a feat of the human mind that anyone could think John was capable of murder, let alone carving out a little girl‚Äôs face when he could barely handle clowns. Poor John. He must have been so miserable inside the mental ward. From what he had told her, it sounded like they were putting him through psychological torture.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all over now, though,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúAnd the orphanage and the people it helps is worth it.‚Äù

She sighed and scraped the thinly chopped carrots into a salad bowl. ‚ÄúI hope none of the insanity from last time starts up again. Considering all we‚Äôve experienced, I‚Äôd say that's enough bad luck to last three lifetimes.‚Äù

John laughed, bringing the lighthearted air back to their conversation. ‚ÄúYou could say that again.‚Äù

They continued their chatter, with the kids playing loudly in the background.  Eventually, a sumptuous roast chicken was removed from the oven, and a salad, now fully assembled, was dressed and tossed, and Lisa‚Äôs potatoes were ready to be mashed. Some of the children were allowed to crush the potatoes with forks, albeit with little efficiency, while John led Lisa to the living room table to take a break.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve certainly improved at cooking,‚Äù She observed as John brought her a glass of water. ‚ÄúThe last time you tried to cook a pancake, a fire nearly burnt the whole kitchen to a crisp.‚Äù

A flush spread across his face. ‚ÄúWell, I was only nine‚Ä¶ Though I will say that cooking at midnight without the sisters‚Äô permission or supervision wasn‚Äôt very wise.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe both got in trouble for that, by the way,‚Äù Lisa said, giving him a playful nudge with her elbow. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I let you drag me into it.‚Äù

He opened his mouth to respond, but at that moment a loud clatter and a bloodcurdling wail came from the kitchen.

‚ÄúAah! No hitting each other with the silverware!‚Äù John called, worry coursing through his voice. John mouthed sorry to Lisa, and she heard his panicked shouts fade away in the distance as he rushed toward the noise.

She sighed, smiling fondly. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt leave them alone, huh?‚Äù With nothing to do but to wait for dinner, Lisa‚Äôs eyes wandered, eventually landing on a conversation that some of the children who weren‚Äôt interested in the potato pandemonium were having.

‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS your role model?‚Äù A girl with blonde hair sneered, peeking at a drawing clutched in the hand of a boy dressed in a tremendous amount of black.

He immediately snatched it away from her, giving the snooping girl the stink-eye. He stretched himself taller, addressing her dramatically, ‚ÄúWe vampire slayers have aspired to be more like my ancestor, Abraham Van Hellsing, since the dawn of time. I am certainly no different.‚Äù

The girl rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre the same age. How long are you planning to keep leaning into your delusions, Jon-nerd-ah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever. If you‚Äôre gonna call my role model lame, then let me see yours.‚Äù And before she could react, Jonah nabbed the girl‚Äôs paper. After a few seconds, he wore the same sneer she did just a moment ago, albeit a deep scowl now replaced her expression. ‚ÄúSeriously? He‚Äôs such a scaredy-cat! You can‚Äôt make fun of the greatest vampire hunter in history if you look up to-‚Äù

‚ÄúGive it back, jerkwad!‚Äù She hissed, her ears turning red. She grabbed at her paper and tugged hard. It strained back and forth between them until it tore violently in half, the ripped pieces falling to the floor. The teens stared as it glided smoothly and landed at Lisa‚Äôs feet.

She picked them up. It was a picture of what looked like John, now severed at the waist, each detail carefully sketched in blue pen. It was remarkably feminine, with big eyes that clipped out of the head and long, sparkly lashes that were partially detached from his eyes. His legs were significantly shorter than his torso, which was so skinny that it looked as if a corset was permanently wound around it.

‚ÄúOh, sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù Lisa mumbled as the blonde girl stomped up to her, clenching her jaw and flushing red. ‚ÄúUm, you‚Äôre a very good artist.‚Äù She must be self-conscious about her drawings.

She placed the paper halves into the girl‚Äôs hands and watched as she silently climbed the stairs. Jonah scoffed and went back to drawing, rolling his eyes.

Just then, John came out of the kitchen panting heavily, looking disheveled with two children under his arms. All three of them were covered in bits of potato, with the girl under his left arm wiping some off her tanned face and sticking it in her mouth with a dreamy expression. The boy under his right arm looked rather sour and was crossing his chubby arms in a tiny fit, though it didn‚Äôt stop him from eating the potato off his face as well.

‚ÄúDinner- dinner‚Äôs ready,‚Äù John wheezed, catching his breath. He took a towel from his apron pocket and wiped the potato off the children‚Äôs faces, then his own. ‚ÄúJonah, please call everyone to the dining room.‚Äù

The boy smothered in black dramatically sighed and went upstairs. John then gestured for Lisa to follow him, hanging his apron back on a hook on the wall.

After a little more wrangling, everyone sat around the dining table and John led them in a short prayer, letting everyone eat. The air was soon filled with the banter of children.

‚ÄúSally, look, Jonah is cutting his chicken into a funny circle!‚Äù A girl with curly ginger hair exclaimed, shoving a dripping piece of tomato and onion into her mouth.

The black-haired girl next to her wrinkled her nose. ‚ÄúSarah, dummy, don‚Äôt chew with your mouth open. It‚Äôs gross.‚Äù Turning to Jonah, she peered at his plate. ‚ÄúSo childish. Didn‚Äôt Mom ever teach you to not play with your food?‚Äù He pushed her face away with his hand, eyes still focused on his spectacularly butchered chicken.

‚ÄúMommy, can I have some more orange juice?‚Äù A pudgy-looking boy squeaked, holding out his empty glass.

‚ÄúOf course!‚Äù John filled it halfway and smiled. ‚ÄúBy the way, Tommy, have you seen Mina at all? She hasn‚Äôt come down for dinner.‚Äù His face crinkled in worry. ‚ÄúI hope she didn‚Äôt get herself into trouble again.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think she‚Äôs still upstairs,‚Äù A pale boy with white hair said, spooning himself some mashed potatoes. ‚ÄúI saw her walk past when I was watching over the baby. She was pretty red, I think Jonah might‚Äôve said something.‚Äù

Jonah let out a loud humph. ‚ÄúFirst of all, commoner, my name shan‚Äôt be slandered this way. My full title is Ulysses Van He-‚Äù The girl named Sally glared at him and pinched his cheek, causing him to yowl.

‚ÄúStop that!‚Äù He squawked indignantly, batting her hand away.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care about your daydreams, schizophrenic.‚Äù

John sighed. ‚ÄúChildren, please, not at the dinner table‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll go find Mina. Please stay behaved, you all.‚Äù He shot Lisa a pleading look and she gave him a small thumbs-up.

A child sitting next to her with short pigtails tapped her arm, hazel eyes wide. ‚ÄúAre you Mommy‚Äôs girlfriend?‚Äù

Lisa laughed. ‚ÄúNo, but I knew him when we were children. He mentioned it in my introduction, didn‚Äôt he?‚Äù

The girl murmured a quiet ohhh and turned back to her food. Lisa then watched as she tried unsuccessfully to feed the baby in the hi-chair some lettuce, only to have a glob of mushed apple thrown in her face instead. The girl wiped it off, giving it the stink eye and throwing some of the mush right back. It landed on the baby‚Äôs bib, and it blew a raspberry at her. Lisa had to stuff her mouth with chicken to stifle her laughter.

Fortunately, other than the oddly sassy baby, the children took heed of their mother‚Äôs words this time and stayed relatively calm long enough for John to come back, unfortunately alone.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a little upset,‚Äù John whispered to Lisa. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save her some food for when she‚Äôs hungry.‚Äù

The dinner wrapped up in a surprisingly orderly manner as the kids piled their plates up next to the sink, some of them making off with a small candy from a basket Father Garcia had left behind. Most of them ran back into the playroom to play, while John picked up the baby and rocked him.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a place I wanted to show you but never got the chance to,‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúI have to put the baby to sleep, so I could ask one of the older children to lead you if you have time.‚Äù

Lisa nodded. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù

He smiled, then beckoned over a boy taller than him with curly brown locks. ‚ÄúLiam, if you could show Lisa the backyard‚Ä¶‚Äù

They spoke quietly to each other, and eventually, John went upstairs, leaving Lisa with the teen. ‚ÄúFollow me please, and watch your step,‚Äù Liam said, opening the backdoor to the house. It was raining lightly. He grabbed two umbrellas from the basket next to the frame, handing one to her and opening his outside. A winding stone path led from the door, glossy with water and lined with wooden fences holding back lush greenery. It had an ethereal beauty to it that Lisa couldn‚Äôt quite put her finger on, as if it were a portal leading to an undiscovered utopia.

They followed along past small ponds filled with algae and the occasional frog resting on a lily pad. She drank in the scent of the outdoors she‚Äôd missed from her childhood, sighing and closing her eyes. I didn‚Äôt realize how much I needed this. Lisa breathed, grinning. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

Liam returned her smile. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mention it.‚Äù

After a bit more walking, they reached a clearing framed with a clumsily built wooden arch, propped up with strings firmly tied to pegs in the ground. Inside was a garden with a gigantic pine tree in the center, the space around it filled with rows and rows of plants neatly separated by their types.

There were small paper tabs stuck into the soil labeling each one, all in different colors. Lisa bent down to read one under a scrawny stalk bearing small green bulbs, squinting at the smudged red marker. The tab read: Stawberys!!! And in neater handwriting under it: Planted 3/1/88 by Tommy Weissman.

It‚Äôs the end of June right now. ‚ÄúThat was almost four months ago.‚Äù She stood up. ‚ÄúI never knew they took so long to grow.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt,‚Äù Liam said, approaching the plant and cupping one of the berries in his palm. He gazed at it sadly and dropped it, sighing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been taking care of the garden most of the time, and it‚Äôs been like this for a while now.‚Äù He said. ‚ÄúAll of the plants have. None of us were able to figure out what‚Äôs happening, and neither has Father Garcia or John.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow awful,‚Äù Lisa said, frowning. ‚ÄúIs there any way I could‚Ä¶‚Äù

But there was something she could do. Or rather, something a certain someone else could do, someone she knew very well.

She pondered for a moment. ‚ÄúWould it be alright if I brought my friend Tiffany over to the orphanage sometime?‚Äù She asked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, but she did earn a bachelor‚Äôs degree in plant biology. She‚Äôll know something.‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúSure, I‚Äôll ask John and see if he agrees.‚Äù

After looking around for a bit further, the two left the withering paradise for the orphanage. The rain had stopped during their short trip outside, and Liam took Lisa‚Äôs umbrella. John was nowhere to be seen.

‚ÄúWell, I should head home,‚Äù Lisa said, navigating through the children playing on the floor. ‚ÄúPlease tell John I‚Äôll be visiting again soon and to consider my offer.‚Äù She shook Liam‚Äôs hand, then made toward the door.

‚ÄúWAIT!!‚Äù The girl with pigtails from dinner came bounding towards Lisa, wearing a toothy grin. ‚ÄúI drew you something!‚Äù She squealed and showed her a piece of paper. It was a crayon drawing of a flower field with a rainbow in the back, the sky illuminated by a yellow sun in the corner. ‚ÄúYou can have it if you want.‚Äù

Lisa took it and smiled fondly, patting the girl‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúThank you so much! I‚Äôll be sure to keep it safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBye-bye!‚Äù The girl shouted from the front door as Lisa waved from her car window. She watched as she quickly scurried back inside, and with a final wave from Liam, the door closed.

As soon as she was sure she was alone, Lisa leaned back in her seat, sighing.

Children are cute, but they sure can be a fuckin‚Äô handful.

\*\*\*

It was dark outside when Lisa finally arrived home.  She opened the door, and it creaked open to reveal a messy living room with moving boxes strewn everywhere and some clothes abandoned carelessly around the place. The few pieces of furniture that were set up were covered in a thin layer of dust from lack of use, other than the couch that sat across from the TV. It looks like Tiffany hasn‚Äôt finished moving her stuff in yet.

Lisa had asked Tiffany to move in with her, not wanting her to be stuck back at the apartment complex after what happened with the cult. She tried to help her with the boxes she had brought, but Tiffany refused to let her touch them, adamant that she put them away herself. As it had taken several months to convince her to stay, Lisa decided not to push it.

But now the boxes seemed to be completely abandoned in favor of several papers, many of them filled with messy lettering. Tiffany scrutinized them heavily, the sheets mere inches from her eyes as she bent over and scribbled illegible words on them. She was so focused on them that she never noticed Lisa enter the house, only reacting once she cleared her throat heavily.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre back!‚Äù Tiffany said cheerfully, shambling forward to greet Lisa. Her eyes were weighed down with faint bags of fatigue that stained her usual doll-like complexion.

I wonder what‚Äôs got her so preoccupied.

‚ÄúWhere have you been?‚Äù She said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never been out for longer than an hour if you could help it.‚Äù

‚ÄúJohn invited me,‚Äù Lisa yawned, giving her a quick hug and collapsing onto the sofa. ‚ÄúHe runs an orphanage.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh?‚Äù Tiffany returned to her papers. ‚ÄúTell me about it.‚Äù

She ended up talking over the soap opera starting to air on TV, while Tiffany responded to everything with an occasional hum or a short laugh. She‚Äôs trying to sound interested, but her eyes aren‚Äôt leaving the papers. Curious, Lisa leaned in close to peek at them.

Tiffany sat up from her curled-up position at the same time, and their heads ended up colliding in a painful thunk. Lisa yelped, while Tiffany barely flinched.

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ Sorry,‚Äù She mumbled, picking up an empty mug and shuffling toward the kitchen. ‚ÄúBy the way, are you hungry? I can whip something up for you before I go back to work.‚Äù

Lisa shook her head. ‚ÄúI had dinner there, remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh. Right.‚Äù She closed them and headed for the water kettle. ‚ÄúAlright. More coffee for me, then.‚Äù

‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù Lisa blanched. ‚ÄúTiff, it‚Äôs almost 8-‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, I know.‚Äù Tiffany laughed dryly. ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be helped, though. I can‚Äôt sleep until I get a job.‚Äù Her laughter fizzled off into a melancholy sigh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been denied by all of the ones I‚Äôve applied to. Not even a week of consideration, just an immediate letter of rejection.‚Äù

Lisa tilted her head. ‚ÄúHow long have you been sending applications to these companies?‚Äù

Tiffany was suddenly very interested in watching the water boil.

‚ÄúYou can tell me,‚Äù She said, laughing nervously.

After a long pause, Tiffany waved her hand as if clearing the air. ‚ÄúI-it doesn‚Äôt matter. It‚Äôll happen eventually.‚Äù She showed her a wobbly attempt at a smile. ‚ÄúJust a matter of time. Oh, don‚Äôt look at me like that,‚Äù She said sadly as her friend gave her an unconvinced look, ‚ÄúIt just takes a while to find the right one.‚Äù

Lisa thought for a moment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll stay up with you then, at the very least. Someone‚Äôs gotta make sure you take care of yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúEh?‚Äù Tiffany flinched. ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. By the time I finish filling out all the forms, it might already be dawn.‚Äù She fidgeted. ‚ÄúI might not finish at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I could help you fill out the applications,‚Äù Lisa said, standing up from the couch and stretching. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm no good with persuasive writing, but I don‚Äôt want you passing out in the middle of the day tomorrow because of this.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut your paintings-‚Äù

‚ÄúThey can wait.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you have plans tomorrow-‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm free all day.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour sleep schedule‚Ä¶‚Äù Tiffany mumbled, her hands gripping the mug tightly.

Lisa firmly shook her head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, it‚Äôs fine. It‚Äôs not as bad as you think it is. And if it‚Äôs this important to you, then it is to me as well.‚Äù

Tiffany gave her a look of concern. ‚Äú...You don‚Äôt have to do this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Lisa said, smiling. ‚ÄúBut I want to.‚Äù",01 May 2024 17:18:45,reddit

Hi, everyone!  
I just completed the Prologue (edit, edit, repeat...) of my horror novel. Set in the late 1980's/early 90's.

   
I welcome all constructive feedback, thank you!

Prologue (1987)
  

  
The last thing Ray saw when his foot caught the tree root was the box, flying and landing with a crash as it burst open on the trail ahead of him. He had caught himself on his knees when he tripped, but his hands were firmly embedded in the mud. Wiping them disgustedly on his pants, he sighed and went to examine the remains of the box and its contents, now strewn across the path. Penthouse, Swank, Playboy, Hustler. They lay spread open among the thickening brambles. The images on their pages winked up at him as they flapped like leaves in the cold November wind. Dirty magazines, his mother called them. 
  
	Ray scrambled to gather them up and haphazardly shoved them back into the now-torn cardboard box. He stopped and looked around, wiping sweat from his brow with the sleeve of his coat, and was suddenly overcome with the fear that someone might be watching him. Despite the silent woods and the darkened abandoned house, he felt watched. He thought that he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye, something in the trees but when he turned to look, everything was silent and still.
  
For a week, he had traveled this path as he transferred his collection (stored in moving boxes that were labeled, ‚ÄúRay‚Äôs comic books‚Äù) from his mother‚Äôs attic to the forgotten, old house in the woods up behind the abandoned Hospital. 
  
Ray‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house sat at the top of Fuller Street, about a hundred yards short of the concrete, Jersey barriers that blocked the entrance to the hospital. Fuller Street wound through the woods like a proverb, steering the prudent up and away from the realm of the dead. At the bottom of Fuller Street, before it shot out through a meadow to the main road, sat an isolated kettle of pond water that leaked languidly through muddy flatlands. The unnatural cauldron of water glowed with wild blue-green algae, which, at night, flickered weirdly off the trees. 
  
At the top, just beyond Ray‚Äôs house, the road opened onto the overgrown entrance of the old hospital. Carved out of the forest, the abandoned building stood, stone-like against towering pine trees. Deeper into the tree line, behind the hospital, there was a crooked, forgotten road with a house on it.
  
The house haunted the woods in its silent solemnity, lingering behind after a secret neighborhood that was once used to house hospital staff fell into neglect and disrepair. It was the last of the five houses that had lined the oval cul-de-sac now broken and overgrown with wild weeds. The house slept still and silent, nestled in the dark New England woods. Its spirit as shuttered and dormant as the abandoned hospital it once served.
  
Ray had found the house, with padlocked doors and barred windows almost impenetrable. After climbing the rusted fire escape, he was surprised to find that the third-floor door had been left unlocked. Carefully exploring the empty house, Ray moved his way down the stairs and into the basement. There, he found exactly what he had been looking for, walls lined with empty wooden bookcases. From that day, Ray had spent the next week moving his collection into his own, private, pornography museum. 
  
Ray shouldered the box and climbed up the fire escape, heaving the torn cardboard onto the grated steel landing at the top. The third-floor door had been left ajar and Ray paused, inspecting it while trying to remember if he had left the door open on his last trip. He had been careful to shut it every time he had come and gone so as not to draw any unwanted attention to anyone that might pass by. Ray shook his head at his perceived carelessness as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him. His breathing labored as he carried the box down, through the house, and into the basement. As he slid the last magazine into place, he sat down on a metal folding chair to admire his collection as it sat, like Ray, in its final resting place. He lost himself in the endless possibilities that the magazines seemed to promise, and in the gathering dusk that slowly descended on the woods and the house that sat within it, he failed to notice a movement in the lengthening shadows behind him. 
  
As if gathering itself together from the white dust that covered the floor, the outline of a person slinked out of the inky darkness at the corner of the room. The ghostly figure of a nurse dressed all in white and sporting a nurse‚Äôs cap on its head, slowly slithered its way closer and closer to Ray as he sat in lustful anticipation trying to decide which magazine he would open first. The figure seemed to move in silent fits and starts, convulsing soundlessly as it inched ever closer to the seated man at the center of the room. 
  
Ray stood and reached forward, grabbing a Swank from the bookcase. He unbuckled his belt and his pants dropped to the floor around his ankles as he sat back down on the cold metal chair. The chair creaked in defiance beneath him as he leaned back and opened the magazine. A wicked grin stretched across the nurse‚Äôs face as she brought the knife down with an ear-splitting scream. Again, and again the knife and the scream fell with pounding blood-soaked fury as Ray‚Äôs eyes lit up with confused, white-hot, pain. Fading in and out of consciousness, Ray prayed for the end to come quickly, it didn‚Äôt.

# The Brand Behind The Creation of This Weight Loss Marvel

Originating from the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, this weight loss tonic doesn‚Äôt name anyone as its owner. However, a team of experts and researchers have worked together to develop this marvel of weight loss.

The manufacturers have sourced ingredients from Indonesia and other parts of the world with ethical practices to ensure they remain true to their standards at every step. Furthermore, the supplement has been refined in an FDA and GMP-approved facility in the USA.

# How Does Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic Facilitate Weight Reduction?

A study has inspired the formula showing that lack of sleep slows your metabolism and leads to an ineffective fat-burning process. Consequently, the creators have designed Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic to improve sleep quality.

Deep sleep means that your body‚Äôs ability to burn fat improves significantly, so you begin to shed excess weight. Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic ensures you melt away all the excess fat while sleeping! We haven‚Äôt seen anything this convenient since Phen24.

# A Breakdown Of The Composition Label Of Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic

Below we have provided a breakdown of the composition label for Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic. This breakdown will help you understand the key ingredients and their scientific backing:

# Black Cohosh

Black Cohosh is a perennial herb native to North America. It belongs to the Buttercup family and contains compounds called triterpene glycosides, which are believed to be responsible for its weight loss benefits. These compounds have been found to interact with estrogen receptors in the body, particularly the beta-receptors found in fat cells.

By binding to these receptors, Black Cohosh can help regulate fat metabolism and prevent the accumulation of excess fat. Furthermore, it has been suggested that Black Cohosh can also have an impact on appetite control and insulin sensitivity, further supporting weight loss efforts.

At the end of a study, a group taking the Black Cohosh supplement experienced an average weight loss of 3.4%, compared to the placebo group which only saw a 1.2% weight loss. Additionally, the Black Cohosh group also saw a reduced body fat percentage.

# Spirulina Blue

Spirulina Blue is vibrant blue-green in color, reflecting its natural origins from Spirulina algae. It has a mild, earthy taste, which makes it easy to incorporate into supplements like Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic

A study conducted by researchers at the University of Medical Sciences in Iran explored the effects of Spirulina supplementation on weight loss in obese subjects. The study involved 64 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either Spirulina supplements or a placebo.

After a period of 12 weeks, the group taking the Spirulina supplements showed a significant decrease in body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body fat percentage compared to the placebo group. The results from the study showed that Spirulina supplementation led to a 9% reduction in body weight.

# Lutein

Lutein is a naturally occurring carotenoid pigment that is found in various colorful fruits and vegetables, particularly green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale. It is composed of a carbon backbone with a series of alternating single and double bonds, along with oxygen and hydrogen atoms.

Lutein interacts with the receptors in the brain that regulate our appetite and satiety signals. Lutein has been found to stimulate the release of certain satiety hormones, such as peptide YY and cholecystokinin, which help to reduce hunger pangs and increase the feeling of fullness.

Additionally, lutein has been shown to modulate the levels of neuropeptides involved in appetite control, such as orexins and melanin-concentrating hormones. By influencing these signaling pathways, lutein helps to regulate our food intake and decrease cravings for unhealthy, calorie-dense foods.

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.

I remember my very first day of work nearly six months ago with horrifying clarity, the memories still shining like keloid scars across my mind. My new partner and I got sent to a Victorian house in the middle of a forest of dead, twisted trees. Our boss, an old Greek man with balding hair who chain-smoked Marlboros constantly, had warned us that the scene would be a fiasco. An entire family of six had suffocated from a freak carbon monoxide leak. Soon after that, the bizarre occurrences began.

‚ÄúThey sent a repairman out there for something or another,‚Äù George explained through a cloud of thick, gray smoke, smashing out a half-smoked cigarette and lighting up another one without pausing. We sat in the office across the desk from him, wearing our dark blue uniforms with the logo of ‚ÄúBig George‚Äôs Cleaners‚Äù emblazoned across the chest. I had laughed when I first saw the name of the cleaning business. Big George sounded like the name of a seven-foot-tall pimp to me, not this small, bent man with a thick Greek accent and white fluffs of hair forming a wispy horseshoe around his head.

‚ÄúSo what happened?‚Äù I asked. George inhaled deeply, meeting my gaze.

‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know exactly what he saw, but he was screaming about baby‚Äôs arms and spiders.‚Äù I groaned.

‚ÄúDead spiders?‚Äù my partner, Xavier, asked hopefully. George shook his head ruefully.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know, son. I figure you‚Äôll find out when you get there, eh?‚Äù George got up and slapped me on the back in a fatherly way. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre in good hands with Xavier. He‚Äôs worked here for over three months. One of our longest-lasting employees!‚Äù

I looked over at my new partner doubtfully. Gang tattoos ran up the lengths of his arms, and he had a teardrop tattoo below his left eye. He looked like the type of person who only got a job to keep his parole officer happy.

We walked out into the clean summer air, the small town around us bustling with midday traffic. Xavier pointed to the panel van parked behind the building, an ancient, black rusted heap of a van with the company‚Äôs logo peeling off the side.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs our ride. She‚Äôs a beauty, huh?‚Äù Xavier said. I smiled politely. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù

‚ÄúBrian,‚Äù I said curtly. ‚ÄúBrian Felman. So this company has a high turnover rate, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúHigh turnover rate, high disappearance rate.‚Äù He shrugged apathetically. ‚ÄúNone of my business. That‚Äôs why we get hazard pay, right?‚Äù He laughed- a shrill, dry sound that sounded much higher than his normal voice.

We got in, and Xavier put on some blaring rap song that I tried to block out. We drove for what felt like hours, going deeper and deeper into the middle of nowhere. The GPS started taking us down pothole-strewn dirt trails before finally failing completely five miles from the place. We drove up and down the road until, after thirty minutes of searching, we found the only house in the area. The thin, looming turrets loomed overhead, like sharp spikes set up to impale the sky. The exterior of the building appeared dull and filthy, the white paint yellowed with age. Cracked windows covered in dust and grime leered at us from the top floors.

‚ÄúWell, that‚Äôs gotta be it,‚Äù I said, glancing down at the paperwork George had given us. It just said ‚Äú1 Ghoulish Road, Barton.‚Äù I looked up at the house, but it had no number on it. The road hadn‚Äôt even had a street sign. From what I saw, Barton probably didn‚Äôt have more than a hundred people living in it. Perhaps they didn‚Äôt use street signs in such an abandoned area.

Then I saw the police crime scene tape rolled out in an X across the door, and I knew we had arrived at the right house.

‚ÄúI hate spiders,‚Äù Xavier offered like a piece of sage advice, sighing. He lit a cigarette in the van, which technically wasn‚Äôt allowed but, after all, no one was here to complain. He handed the pack to me and I took one. I looked over at him.

‚ÄúWell, as long as they‚Äôre dead, who cares?‚Äù I said. He got out and started putting on protective gear, tucking his pants into his socks while he fished out two pairs of thick rubber suits. ‚ÄúThey are dead, right?‚Äù He gave me a grim smile.

I sighed as I looked down at the suit. It looked like something an Axis frogman might have worn during World War 2. I wondered where George got half this stuff.

After we both put on the hot and stuffy rubber suits, Xavier reached into the back doors of the van and pulled out two gas masks. I stuffed one on my head and began adjusting the straps, making sure it was airtight. It felt somewhat suffocating and also obscured my peripheral vision. Two small circular holes of ballistic glass were the only opening for sight.

I glanced over at Xavier. He looked like a cross between a SWAT officer and a scuba diver figurine from a fish tank. I figured I looked exactly the same. We took the canisters of poison with a sprayer nozzle out of the van. I strapped the heavy metal cylinder to my back.

‚ÄúJust in case,‚Äù Xavier said with fake nonchalance as he put on his own sprayer. ‚ÄúSpiders have a tendency to be hardy little bastards. Supposedly, the exterminators already came and sprayed the house once, according to George, but‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, his voice quivering with fear at the end. I could see his eyes rolling and wild behind the mask. Yet he still walked towards the door, ripped away the police tape and walked right inside. I followed close behind him.

The front hallway looked totally dark. I tried flicking a light next to the door, but I got absolutely no response. I didn‚Äôt know if the electricity was cut or if the light bulbs had all gotten smashed by vandals. I took out a small LED flashlight from the random items looped into my work belt, clicking it on and shining the bright white beam around. An instinctual, primordial horror came over me as I saw what scurried all around us.

It looked like brown recluse spiders, some of them nearly a foot long, and they most certainly were not dead. There were thousands of them, but that wasn‚Äôt even the worst part.

They all had strange, small, white baby legs and arms, slightly longer and more emaciated-looking than something taken from a Barbie doll. Each had four grasping arms in the front and four bent legs in the back. Except these didn‚Äôt look plastic. All the miniaturized limbs looked real, with tiny dimples in the elbows and smooth rolls of fat like an infant‚Äôs.

The spiders made sounds that sounded almost human. They opened their fanged mouths and cried out with the cooing or shrieking of a baby. Infantile cries began to sound all around us, echoing and mixing in a cacophony of high-pitched shrieking and wailing. I tried to block it out, pulling out my poison nozzle to start spraying. I took a headlamp George had given me out of my belt and flicked off the flashlight.

I looked for the best place to start. A layer of dead spiders littered the floors, their curled-up doll legs facing upwards with tiny fingers clenched in death. The white skin of the miniature human appendages peeled off in dry, papery layers.

But I didn‚Äôt look at the hundreds of spider corpses for too long, because at that moment, something heavy landed on my shoulder. I screamed through my gas mask. The sound came out muffled and choked. Spinning around crazily, I tried to get the spider off my protective suit. I craned my head and saw a massive brown recluse only inches away from my face. I gasped as I looked at this mutated abomination.

It had six black, soulless eyes. The pincers clicked open and closed, dripping clear fluid. The venomous spider‚Äôs long back had a marking like a dark brown violin. As its pincers flew wide open, it opened its mouth wide, and I saw teeth inside no spider should possess. Tiny, fanged teeth, like the canines of a human. It had an entire set of these sharp, vampiric fangs. Then, in a blur, it lunged for my face. I felt it smash into the side of the gas mask, and then, emanating cries like a hungry baby, it tried to bite through it.

I dropped the large poison canister I carried and ran shrieking towards the door, more spiders falling down all around me as I went. Some jumped from the ceiling. Others skittered over the bodies of their comrades, bodies that covered the floor like a rug from some nightmarish acid trip.

Xavier hadn‚Äôt fared much better. I heard him close behind me, his steel-toe boots smashing the mutated corpses with muted thuds. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe in the confining gas mask. I had a sudden insane urge to rip it off. But I felt more spiders skittering across my shoulders and back now, and I knew that both of us were likely covered. A large part of me wanted to run screaming from that house, clean the century-old wood with the pungent, refreshing smell of gasoline and watch those abominations burn.

We sprinted out the door out into the summer light streaming down from a clear blue sky, covered in dozens of the freakish spiders. One of them skittered up my chest and covered my face. I couldn‚Äôt see anything, but I still had the poison canister attached to my back. I brought it up and began spraying it at the abomination. It gave a very human whimper as its doll legs began to kick and seize, its surreal mouth opening into a O of surprise. It gave a cry like a starving infant and fell to the black earth in front of me, its miniature demonic face finally relaxing as the mouth went slack and its six eyes glazed over.

Over the next few minutes, Xavier and I killed all the spiders that still attached themselves to our thick rubber suits. To my horror, a few dozen of them streamed out the open door and into the surrounding dead trees. I ran over as soon as I saw them escaping. I wondered if they would begin a new population of mutated, freakish spiders in the environment.

Shaking and traumatized, we went back to the van. Xavier said George had supplies for just such an occasion.

‚ÄúDo you know what Zyklon B is?‚Äù he asked me, lighting a cigarette and checking his phone. I shrugged.

‚ÄúNot really,‚Äù I admitted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just pellets of stabilizer mixed with hydrogen cyanide,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe entire can is kept under high pressure, so once we open it, cyanide gas is released and begins spreading throughout the entire area. However, you can speed up the reaction by pouring the pellets into a metal bucket of sulfuric acid.‚Äù He pulled out a heavy barrel with danger logos prominently emblazoned in bright red all around its perimeter, then told me to grab a small metal container with the letters ‚ÄúH2SO4‚Äù and ‚ÄúWarning: Do Not Inhale. Do Not Allow to Come in Contact with Skin‚Äù written prominently on the side.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to have to gas those fuckers,‚Äù Xavier admitted, grinning.

\*\*\*

Needless to say, the fumigation worked. We started at the front door, running in and slamming it behind us. With tightly-secured gas masks and full body coverings, I put the small metal bucket of sulfuric acid down in the middle of the writhing mass of spiders and Xavier poured the pellets in. We quickly ran out of the house, but as we left, I saw great, billowing clouds of white chemical smoke exploring the hallways and corridors with opaque, reaching fingers.

By the end of the day, after airing out the house, we only had the problem of having to dispose of tens of thousands of freakish spider-doll corpses. A few of them still clung to life as we swept the bodies up into barrels and trash bags, trying to use their eerily human teeth to inject us with the brown recluse‚Äôs agonizing hemotoxic poison. However, our protective suits did their jobs well enough, and no one died- at least not on my first day.

As we did a final sweep through the house, I went into the basement and found a trapdoor. It had a rusted black metal handle that stuck up a fraction an inch from the surrounding beams. I nearly tripped over it, otherwise I would never have seen it through the dirt and grime covering everything down there. The worn boards looked fused to the aging floor, so much so that I couldn‚Äôt even see the trapdoor‚Äôs seam. Curious, I called up to Xavier.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, there‚Äôs a trapdoor down here. Should we open it, you think?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIt could be filled with more spiders. Imagine if some Karen and her shitty husband and bratty kids moved in here and found half-human spiders pouring out of some hidden compartment in the basement.‚Äù Xavier came down the stairs, smoking a cigarette, having taken his gas mask off once the last of the cyanide gas had dissipated out all the open windows and doors. We both still wore thick rubber suits.

Xavier had just finished pouring the soiled sulfuric acid off the porch into the weed-strewn dirt in front of the house, laughing and grinning, turning his head up to the sky and screaming cheerfully, ‚ÄúThose fuckers won‚Äôt be able to grow a lawn here for a dozen years!‚Äù I had laughed at the pure enjoyment and lunacy in his face. I could tell this was a person who never held back anything.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù he said, frowning as he climbed down the basement stairs. He took a deep drag on his cigarette, looking at the trapdoor with one eye squinted, as if it were a particularly pernicious cockroach he wanted to crush. He sighed, letting out a long, unhappy breath. ‚ÄúWell, I guess we might as well check it out. Put your gas mask back on and grab the poison sprayer, just in case. It‚Äôs a small space, so we could probably just spray it.‚Äù We suited up. I walked over and flung open the trapdoor, but there wasn‚Äôt a single spider down there. The dirt floor of the small hidden room was swept clean in eerie spiral patterns, reminding me of pictures of crop circles.

Instead of spiders, we found what looked like a site for ritual sacrifices. On an ancient table ten feet below us, human arm and leg bones formed an inverted pentagram around a grinning skull. A gleaming black dagger with an obsidian handle pierced the skull through its topmost point, the spot where Hindus say the crown chakra is located. A circle had been drawn around the ritual site with salt. Various ancient-looking leather-bound books lay on the long, mahogany table, written in an alphabet I had never seen before.

‚ÄúThis is freaking weird,‚Äù I said, frowning. Xavier quickly pulled me out and we slammed the trapdoor shut, giving each other wary looks. Something didn‚Äôt feel right about this. I felt a sense of energy rising from the secret chamber, a smell like ozone and a sizzling in the air that made the hairs on my body stand straight up.

Far worse than the feeling, however, was what I thought I saw. I kept seeing something pale and bloodless and tall peeking around corners, its face twisted in an unnatural grin. But when I turned to look, whatever it was had gone. I hoped that this was only my imagination. I didn‚Äôt tell Xavier about it.

‚ÄúI think we need to call a professional this week,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWhoever set this shit up is probably the cause of the freakish spiders. We might have a witch on our hands.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Now that I had an idea of what was expected of me at the job, I really didn‚Äôt know how thrilled I felt about it. But George was paying extremely well, over $30 an hour after hazard pay bonuses, and there was simply no way I could make that kind of money anywhere else without a degree or professional skill, except maybe by selling drugs.

So I went back to work the next day. I don‚Äôt know if the stars frowned upon me that week or if I was just naturally cursed, but things didn‚Äôt improve at all.

In fact, the second crime scene we cleaned was worse by far.

\*\*\*

There was a psychopath in the area called Dr. Satan, though I don‚Äôt know if he legitimately had his PhD or any family relation to the fallen archangel. Dr. Satan inspired the kind of fear in our area of the country that one rarely sees, even with serial killers. And the ironic part was, Dr. Satan never killed anyone, despite having dozens of victims. Not a single person died at his hands.

Now, his victims probably wished they had died, because the torture he inflicted upon them was some of the worst agony imaginable. Dr. Satan had turned them into mockeries of human beings. He had cut off their legs and arms in pieces, using a surgical saw and no anesthetic or painkillers. He cauterized the wounds as he went before stitching them up. He kept them alive and healthy with antibiotics and intravenous fluids, hence the bestowed media moniker of ‚ÄúDoctor‚Äù.

With only a torso and a screaming head remaining, the person basically became a shrieking pillow with hair. But Dr. Satan wasn‚Äôt done with them yet. He wanted the complete destruction of their sanity, the worst kind of torture and punishment for his victims. He would use a scalpel and cut out their eyes and peel off the eyelids, then start on their ears. He would puncture the eardrums so they couldn‚Äôt hear anymore. Then he‚Äôd cut out the tongue and start on the nose.

By the time he finished, they had barely any senses left and almost certainly no sanity. They couldn‚Äôt walk or grab anything or move their bodies in any way, except perhaps lifting their heads. They would be in a pain so severe that perhaps only burn victims could understand, but this went on much longer than burning alive.

Dr. Satan would trap them in the blackness of their mind for the rest of their lives. They could scream all they wanted in their own heads, but without tongues, the screams would simply die and fester inside them. And the worst part was, he did this in stages over a period of months.

The victims would know there was always more slicing, more torture in the future, but not exactly when. None of the victims of Dr. Satan were able to communicate with anyone in any way. In a few cases, the family members had given the suffering, insane individuals a lethal overdose of barbiturates or opiates as a form of mercy.

I had talked to the police and first responders who found the victims of Dr. Satan. Some of the shrieking human torsos were found in isolated cabins deep in the woods, often foreclosed buildings owned by major banks. Other victims were abandoned in front of churches or in empty parking lots, a nightmarish surprise for anyone who came upon this supreme desecration of the human form. As far as I know, a lot of the first responders who found these horrid scenes are still in therapy, and will likely carry mental scars from what they saw for the rest of their lives.

After a long police investigation, they found an abandoned house Dr. Satan had used for his bizarre surgical practices. It was a cabin on the edge of a stagnant lake, a stinking, fetid hole of a pond that shone a shade of cancerous green. From what Xavier told me on the ride over, the cops had taken three mutilated, totally insane wrecks of human beings from cold steel tables in the cracked basement of the old cabin. The bank who owned the property eventually called our company to try to clean up the immense amounts of blood left staining the entire basement. But there were apparently other remnants from Dr. Satan‚Äôs experiments left in that house.

Our secretary, Caroline, had answered the phone to hear someone screaming on the other end of the line.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve reached Big George‚Äôs Cleaners. I‚Äôm sorry, but I can‚Äôt hear you with all that shrieking in the background.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs eyes in the walls!‚Äù someone cried in a voice choked with terror. ‚ÄúThe blood has faces peering out of it! God, please send someone!‚Äù

‚ÄúWho is this?‚Äù Caroline asked in a calm, nonchalant tone, having dealt with this kind of situation many times before. It was, after all, a dangerous job.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm with Federal United Bank. Oh God, I‚Ä¶‚Äù She heard a door slamming, she said, then a car engine revving. An inhuman wail like a banshee growled over the line, reverberating for a full minute without creature needing to inhale. She heard the man cursing and hyperventilating. It sounded like the man was accelerating at maximum speed, but the demonic wailing drew closer and closer. Finally, the agent came back on the line.

‚ÄúI just left that cursed cabin. I barely escaped with my life. We need someone to come to Turtleback Road. You‚Äôll see it. It‚Äôs marked with police tape. Please come as soon as‚Ä¶ Oh, no! God, it‚Äôs following me!‚Äù She heard glass shattering and the shrieking of tearing metal, then the line went dead.

‚ÄúAh, shit,‚Äù she muttered, writing down the information. She had a feeling that the agent would not be calling her back.

\*\*\*

We pulled up to the cabin early in the morning, not knowing what exactly to expect. We heard a recording of the call to our office. George called the bank and confirmed the existence of the contract to clean the place, even though the man who had originally signed off on it hadn‚Äôt returned to the office or been heard from by anyone. Where his car had gone, I had no idea, and really didn‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt get paid to worry about details like that.

We saw the filthy pond from a distance as the black van rumbled along the dirt road, the well-worn engine grumbling like an old man having a nightmare. The log cabin sat on a patch of black earth in the midst of ancient pine trees. From far away, the building looked innocuous, even idyllic- just a humble hunting retreat for a middle-class bachelor, maybe. Little did I know the horrors that place would bring.

The pond only ten feet from the cabin‚Äôs right wall frothed and hissed, sounding as if it whispered secrets to me in the bursting bubbles of rancid gas that constantly rose to the surface. Strange, barely-glimpsed creatures flitted through the murky, dark-green waters. Algae blooms covered the water like a leper‚Äôs rotting skin. Wide, circular patches of algae were absent in many areas. Through them, I saw slitted eyes and flicking tongues.

In the light of the rising sun, something dark green and slimy slithered out of the farther shore. It turned and looked back at us as we pulled the van to the side of the road. A long, coiled snake with two heads coming off its slick black body regarded us with yellow, slitted eyes. Both heads bobbed and flicked their tongues as they watched us impassively. Then it turned and disappeared into the tall grass and thick evergreens beyond.

‚ÄúWeird shit,‚Äù Xavier grumbled, lighting up a cigarette. He gave the cabin a distrustful look, reminding me of a kicked dog. ‚ÄúI still remember the first time I saw those snakes. I nearly shit myself out of mortal terror.‚Äù I stared at him, confused.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly like I said.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did you see the snakes before?‚Äù I said. He stared for a few seconds at the pond, his eyes distant and haunted. He turned to look at me from the driver‚Äôs seat, reading my face. It looked like he was judging how much he wanted to tell.

‚ÄúWell, we did some cleaning a couple months ago. My old partner was with me. I don‚Äôt know where he is now. One day, he just stopped showing up. And then his family called the office and asked if we had seen him. Caroline told them no, she had no idea where he was.‚Äù He heaved a deep breath, looking shaky and pale. The tattoos stood out like open sores on his trembling body.

‚ÄúWell, the day that he disappeared, we cleaned a house together, maybe ten miles from here. The entire place was filled with mutated snakes. Some of them had multiple heads, others had withered, white limbs sticking out of their sides, dancing and weaving listlessly as they slithered. The limbs had no use and many didn‚Äôt even face the ground. Some also had compound eyes like an insect, six or eight pairs strewn across their black faces. It looked like they had been through a nuclear war or something, man. Something changed those snakes, just like something changed those spiders. Those things shouldn‚Äôt exist, but they do. And you know what I found there?‚Äù I shook my head at his story, fascinated.

‚ÄúI found a skull with a black dagger sticking through its head, just like at the other place. It was part of some weird black magic ritual set up in a hidden room in the attic. And something was following us as we killed the snakes. I couldn‚Äôt ever see it directly, but I knew it was following us. I kept seeing a face leering around corners at me, a grinning, bloodless face that nearly scraped the ceiling. While I drove us back to the office, my partner kept screaming that the thing was following him. He saw it hiding behind trees or in the windows of houses. He started to lose his shit, and later that night, he disappeared forever.‚Äù

\*\*\*

We pulled up next to the swampy waters before the front door into the idyllic log cabin. It had a brownstone brick chimney and an open porch. A few rocking chairs lay there, wavering in the slight breeze.

Xavier went first, muttering to himself. When he took a step up on the porch in front of me, his blue button-down shirt rode up on his skinny body. I caught a flash of a concealed pistol tucked tightly into a hidden holster around his waist.

‚ÄúYou have a gun?‚Äù I asked. He looked down, cursing.

‚ÄúOf course I have a gun, cabron,‚Äù he said, giving me a quick backwards glance.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I felt baffled. What could he possibly shoot during crime scene clean-ups? Not the spiders or two-headed snakes.

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, why? Why don‚Äôt you have a gun?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI can get you one for a few hundred bucks. They‚Äôre probably stolen, but‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you ever had to use it?‚Äù I asked. He shook his head.

‚ÄúNot at work,‚Äù he said cryptically. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù He opened the front door to the cabin, peering inside nervously. He looked left and right, checking the corners, as if he were a SWAT officer clearing a crime scene. Then he inhaled sharply and walked inside. I followed close behind.

The cabin looked beautiful on the first floor. Paintings of mountains and nature covered the walls. A comfortable-looking couch stood in front of a TV and liquor cabinet. Bookshelves filled with thousands of books covered the walls.

‚ÄúThis is actually pretty nice,‚Äù I said, smiling. I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Xavier had started sweating heavily, his eyes large and searching.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this quick,‚Äù he said, heading for the basement. ‚ÄúWe need to see what kind of equipment we need to do the job. This is just bloodstains, so‚Ä¶‚Äù He flung open the door and began descending. I followed him down into the dark.

The police had apparently taken all the dismembered body parts out, but the place still looked horrifying. Three steel, blood-stained tables were fused to the concrete floor. Cracks ran along the concrete and cockroaches and spiders skittered up through them. Blood covered nearly everything, including the walls and the floor. It had dried into a sticky dark paste. With every step, our shoes made a tacky sucking noise.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI mean, it‚Äôs definitely horrifying, but at least there‚Äôs no two-headed snakes or anything, right?‚Äù Xavier didn‚Äôt respond. A sense of energy seemed to sizzle in the air. I felt a change in pressure as if a snowstorm were sweeping in. The smell of ozone mixed with the stink of old, rotting blood.

‚ÄúI have a bad feeling about this place‚Ä¶‚Äù Xavier said when all hell started breaking loose. The basement began to shimmer. A mist as dark as a starless sky billowed around the walls and ceiling in great, swirling currents. And then the walls started to change, the blood on the surfaces rejuvenating, dripping again, brightening into the red of a freshly-slashed throat.

Pale, bloodless hands came out of the walls, stretching and lengthening as if they had minds of their own. The emaciated arms cracked and shivered with pleasure and anticipation. Random splotches of dark blood and flecks of gore stained their skin. Dozens of them reached towards us, constantly extending and thinning their freakish limbs. Bones snapped and popped like firecrackers going off.

I heard a shrill, faraway shrieking. Everything moved slowly, as if seen through water. Waves of adrenaline coursed through my body.

I looked up and saw a shimmering ripple pass through the bare wooden boards of the basement ceiling. A cloying mist the color of blackened, frostbit tissue began to spread from the misty void that seemed to eat the ceiling like some potent acid.

And then the mist began to clear. Hundreds of eyes stared down from the ceiling as the starving, inhuman arms lengthened and reached towards us. I could see a morphing sheet of them above me, human eyes and insect eyes and snake eyes and countless other ones I didn‚Äôt recognize.

They all stared down at us with malice and hatred, a fire burning deep in those alien orbs. I began to pray, knowing I would soon die in this cursed place.",26 Apr 2024 01:28:40,reddit

560,https://i.redd.it/hkn4e3ancyvc1.jpeg,I think I‚Äôm beating my bacterial-turned-algae bloom!,"(Really long, sorry ‚Ä¶ and please excuse the appearance of my tank; it is currently in the ICU, and I use a yellow/green lighting at 10% after 8pm).

So, it looks as if I might be winning that *OBNOXIOUS* assed bacterial bloom that turned into an algae explosion.  Hubby finally stepped in ‚Ä¶ *without* the threatened piranhas (even longer story).

I know now why it happened (a series of things), and have taken note of steps to correct each of the issues.

Saturday, Hubby had me go back to basics ‚Ä¶ which worried the hell out of me because my tank had JUST finished cycling (according to my API master test kit :  0 ammonia, 0 nitrates, 1 nitrate).  Yeah, I know, not much in the nitrate department ‚Ä¶ but it held for three straight days and my nitrates even went up a tad that morning).  But, I couldn‚Äôt stand the pea soup any longer.  So here‚Äôs what we did:

First, we took anything out of the tank that wasn‚Äôt either moving or rooted into the substrate.
    ‚Ä¢  All artificial decorations went into a bucket for complete dry out for the next week or two due to a pond and ramshorn snail infestation.
     ‚Ä¢  Every snail I could find (besides my mystery snails), no matter how small went into Hubby‚Äôs new tank ‚Ä¶ I lost interest in counting after 40.
     ‚Ä¢ Remaining plants were all trimmed of any leaves that weren‚Äôt 90% perfect.  Then, I grouped all the sad remains together and, where necessary, replanted them in groups.  All rooted plants got a root tab or two.
     ‚Ä¢  All remaining plants went into a gallon jug with aquarium water and was set aside.

Second, we addressed the tank itself:
     ‚Ä¢  Drained the tank water waaaaaay down ‚Ä¶ like within 2‚Äù of the substrate.
     ‚Ä¢  Gently stirred up the water as it drained so as much debris as possible went out with the water (debris was for two primary reasons:  too much food - I never had fish before, so this is a learning curve for me - and melted leaves and other plant debris).
     ‚Ä¢  Cleaned all glass surfaces the best I could because even after letting it sit, you still couldn‚Äôt see those bottom 2‚Äù well at all.
     ‚Ä¢  Gently stirred up the debris again, this time netting out as much as I could.

Third, we decided to address temporary filtration measures:
     ‚Ä¢  Cleaned my primary filter (rinsed first in old tank water then gently and quickly with tap (well water)
     ‚Ä¢  Added a secondary 30-60 HOB filter to the front of the tank for now
     ‚Ä¢  Added a UV sterilizer to the 2nd filter
     ‚Ä¢  Added circulation pump to the corner
     ‚Ä¢  Added itty bitty air stones in each corner (I haven‚Äôt hooked up my CO2 yet, and I think another part of the problem I was having was oxygenation of the water.  I had a CO2 drop checker in my tank just because I was curious; it was always unable to decide if it wanted to be blue or just really dark green?)

Next, we refilled it and turned everything on.  It was still cloudy as hell and still had a definite green tint to it, but all I added was a standard tank dosage of API Quick Start.  We gave it 8 hours to run, then only emptied the debris from both filters, stirred things up again, and let it run until this morning.

This morning things were still cloudy, but at least it didn‚Äôt look like milky pea soup and the substrate looked relatively clean again.

Decided to take the opportunity to test out my feeding amounts.  Sprinkled in some Hikari Vibra Bites (about 4 per fish ‚Ä¶ 17 fish total), and some Hikari freeze dried blood worms for the tetras (about 2 per tetra - this distracted the tetras enough to give the corys a chance at the other food).  A couple hours later, only a bit of food was still there, so figured I‚Äôd see how long it took them to clean it up (sorry kids, no second breakfast anymore!)

This evening, there was not a hint of food anywhere, so I will be halving the amount from this morning to make sure it wont be sitting there decaying.  I emptied debris out of filters again, stirred it up once more and let it run.  Decided to add 1/2 dosage of API Accu Clear and about two hours later, I can easily and clearly see to the back of the tank.

From what I have read, now that all the debris and toxins are gone, and the green water algae appears to be dead as well that I should do another 50% water change (tomorrow provided its still clear) to remove that dead algae so it doesn‚Äôt feed another algae bloom.

562,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c94dxu/fixing_elsies_air_conditioner/,Fixing Elsie's Air Conditioner,"I used to work as a debt collector. It‚Äôs a job that gets a bad rap, and sometimes understandably so, but the firm I worked for was one of the better ones. Not only were we highly rated, but our means of collecting were more humane and personal. We didn‚Äôt just show up and take things; we offered personalized payment plans, consultation, and ways to get your things back within a reasonable timeframe.

Still, at the end of the day, it was about the money. And no matter what, people are going to be upset. They‚Äôre going to lose things.

You see a lot of misery in this line of work. Substance abuse, violence, neglect‚Ä¶ a lot of desperate people doing desperate things. Your presence there is just another problem in a long line of problems. People don‚Äôt go into this kind of debt willingly, and I can promise that they‚Äôve made every possible attempt to get out of it. But sometimes, your best isn‚Äôt enough. That‚Äôs when I come knocking.

&nbsp;

But I want to talk about a particular case that I ran into last year. By then I‚Äôd worked with debt collection for 18 months, and I was starting to get into the rhythm of things. It was a late Minnesota spring; the kind where you can get blinded by the sun while shivering from the snow-mixed rainfall. Where the ground turns to slush; staining the edge of your jeans and soaking through your shoes.

I had a case assigned to me about a mismanaged credit card debt. It was unusual to begin with. The guy was a lot younger than my usual clientele, and most of his history was squeaky clean. No unpaid parking tickets, medical bills, or student loans. He‚Äôd just taken out a massive charge on his credit card and clocked out. Since then, no one had been able to reach him.

I‚Äôd looked up his last known address, which he‚Äôd moved from weeks prior. He‚Äôd changed location to a rented townhouse, which he stayed at using fake credentials. It didn‚Äôt take long for me to confirm his new home. He still used the same car, which I could spot in the driveway from halfway down the street.

&nbsp;

He was renting a shared townhouse. It‚Äôs a two-story building where one tenant stays on the bottom floor, and the other stays on the second. Each tenant had their own entrance so the two spaces wouldn‚Äôt intersect. For all intents and purposes, it was his own place ‚Äì just as part of a complete house. This lead me to my first issue; identifying which floor was his.

I knocked on the door on the bottom floor. I waited for a couple of minutes before knocking again, thinking no one was home. I was just about to walk away when a rotund older woman opened the door.

‚ÄúYou here about the air conditioning?‚Äù she growled.

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm looking for a mister‚Ä¶ Robert Corace?‚Äù

‚ÄúCorace?‚Äù she frowned. ‚ÄúAin‚Äôt got no Corace here.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe might go by a different name,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúMid 20‚Äôs kind of guy, long face, brown eyes?‚Äù

‚ÄúUpstairs,‚Äù she sighed. ‚ÄúHe promised to fix my air conditioning. Tell him to get to it. It‚Äôs starting to sting my eyes.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd tell him I ain‚Äôt signing anymore of his packages until he does.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Heading upstairs, I knocked on the door. No answer, of course. I called out his name, announced myself and the company I worked for, and waited patiently.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to come to an agreement,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI know you are in there. You still have your car in the driveway. This won‚Äôt take long, and I‚Äôm not taking anything today; we just need to start a conversation.‚Äù

Minutes passed. Still, nothing.

&nbsp;

I walked a few laps around the house, using a flashlight to check the windows. I couldn‚Äôt see anything in particular ‚Äì most of the windows had their curtains drawn. Old things; probably came with the place. I pressed my face against the side of the door, trying to get a sniff for any familiar odors. It wouldn‚Äôt be the first time I walked into a horrifying scene, and the smell is usually the first sign. This one seemed fine.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to leave a card,‚Äù I said, sliding it halfway under the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back tomorrow. If you‚Äôd like to set up an appointment for a specific time, feel free to call. I‚Äôll talk to you soon, mister Corace.‚Äù

And with that, I headed for my car. The rotund woman on the bottom floor caught me on my way out, trudging through the slush with her oversized rubber boots.

‚ÄúIs he gonna fix my air conditioner?‚Äù she yelled out.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt seem like it, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt itches, you know!‚Äù he scoffed. ‚ÄúAnd it smells bad!‚Äù

And with that, she shook her head and waddled back home, cursing under her breath.

&nbsp;

Coming back the next day, his car was still in the driveway, but the card I‚Äôd slid under his door was gone. He must‚Äôve seen it. It wouldn‚Äôt have blown away; I‚Äôd lodged it in there good. As I knocked on the door, again, the old woman on the bottom floor came out to look. Before she had the chance to ask, I answered her.

‚ÄúNothing about the air conditioner yet,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôll bring it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been weeks!‚Äù she argued. ‚ÄúWeeks!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll get it done.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs torture!‚Äù she complained. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too warm during the day, and too cold during the night!‚Äù

I‚Äôll be the first to admit, I zoned out a bit. I couldn‚Äôt blame him for not coming out while she was around.

&nbsp;

For the entire second day, there was no response. Robert wasn‚Äôt coming out, and there was no sign of him. I explained to the closed door that I wasn‚Äôt a threat, but that this would have to be dealt with eventually. Again, nothing.

Walking around the house with my flashlight, I didn‚Äôt see him. But it looked like some of the curtains had moved; they were a bit lopsided. Maybe he‚Äôd opened them to get a better view of me. Either way, it was clear as day that he was still around.

But I needed something more to go on. And while I loathed what I would have to do, the best way to learn more about Robert Corace was through his neighbor.

&nbsp;

I formally introduced myself to her, and she did the same in turn. Her name was Elsie. She was 83 years old, a former railroad engineer, and lived on her own. The moment I was invited into her home, I could tell there was a problem with her air conditioning. Not only was it hot like a furnace, but there was also a taste of stale air. I promised her I‚Äôd take a look as long as she could tell me a little about mister Corace.

As she invited me into her living room, I stopped dead in my tracks. Saying there was an issue with her air conditioning was an understatement.

The unit, which was mounted into the wall, had long green strings of grass growing out of the front grill. It resembled a thick algae or a sort of vine.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs blocking the fan,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt just chugs, and chugs, and chugs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou should get your landlord to look at it,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not normal.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have that kind of money,‚Äù she groaned. ‚ÄúWhen I told him to fix my bathtub, he hired a contractor to redo all the pipes and had me pay for it. I‚Äôm not falling for that again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou might have to. This isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you can‚Äôt fix it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, I don‚Äôt think God can fix this.‚Äù

&nbsp;

We sat down for a cup of tea as she told me about her experience with mister Corace. Apparently, he was one of the quietest neighbors she‚Äôd had over the years. He was orderly, polite, friendly, and helpful.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ or at least he used to be,‚Äù Elsie sighed. ‚ÄúI barely see him. I think he has one of those stay-at-home jobs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know what he does for a living?‚Äù

This made her pause. She considered this and resigned with a grunt. She pointed to a box by the side of her fridge.

‚ÄúHe gets these ordered to him every now and then,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúI think he grows reefer.‚Äù

I took the box down and checked it out. A simple cardboard box with a black text printed on the side.

‚ÄúHelianthus‚Ä¶ cerulea,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúCerulea, that‚Äôs‚Ä¶ something blue, I think.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre here for the seeds, you‚Äôre out of luck,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúI flushed ‚Äòem all weeks ago. I ain‚Äôt having drugs in my house.‚Äù

&nbsp;

As I left for the second day, I took some time to look up what that word meant. Turns out, helianthus cerulea is a sort of novelty plant. A breed of smaller, more house-friendly, sunflowers; Only with blue petals. Elsie had no idea she‚Äôd washed down at least $350 worth of seeds.

I tried to look up something about vines getting tangled up in air conditioning units, but I couldn‚Äôt find anything useful. There was an article about a woman who‚Äôd hid snacks up there and forgotten them, making them sprout fungus, but that was about it. My best guess was that it was some kind of strangle weed, based on the shape, but it was hard to tell.

Besides, it was not my clowns, and not my circus.

&nbsp;

By the third day, I headed straight for Robert‚Äôs door. I was there at 10 am sharp, and this time I wasn‚Äôt asking.

‚ÄúMister Corace, if you aren‚Äôt willing to comply, we‚Äôre going to have to use other means to contact you. I think it‚Äôd be best for all of us if we could sit down for a conversation and sort this mess out.‚Äù

I knocked again ‚Äì harder.

‚ÄúMister Corace!‚Äù

But of course, there was nothing.

&nbsp;

I couldn‚Äôt help but to wonder where Elsie was. She‚Äôd always stepped out to see what was going on. Had something changed?

‚ÄúMister Corace, I-‚Äú

There was a click from the other side of the door. I shut my mouth and stepped back. As an inch of the door opened, all I could see was a dark room. But I could hear someone.

‚Äú‚Ä¶please keep your voice down.‚Äù

A hoarse voice, dry and fractured.¬† He‚Äôd randomly spike into a whistling noise. Almost the kind of voice you get after a long night at a concert.

‚ÄúMister Corace, do you mind if I come in? We have some business to discuss.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ not at all. Just keep‚Ä¶ your voice down.‚Äù

The door slid open.

&nbsp;

The air was thick with warmth. UV lights lined the walls, illuminating rows upon rows of vines; not too dissimilar from those seen at Elsie‚Äôs. They were overflowing from their pots, covering large parts of the floor. There was a lazy boy chair in the corner of the room, covered with stacks of empty cardboard boxes. Most of the walls were covered in black plastic, sealing in the moisture.

Then there was Robert himself.

Wearing a torn and barely legible ZZ Top t-shirt and a pair of jeans, he looked like he‚Äôd completely retreated from society. Comparing him to his earlier pictures, he‚Äôd grown his hair and beard out to a ridiculous degree, making him look like an untrimmed bush.

He didn‚Äôt even look me in the eyes. He just sort of stumbled back into his dark kitchen area, where I could see more of these plants growing out of the sink.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ have a lot to offer,‚Äù he wheezed. ‚Äú‚Ä¶you like water?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good, thanks.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt like water?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do. I do like water.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶that‚Äôs good. Great. Really great.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Walking among the rows of plants, I couldn‚Äôt help but to look closer. They gave off this strange whiff of ammonia when you got too close. It was subtle, but clear.

‚ÄúSeems you have quite the interest,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNever seen this before.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm an agra-‚Ä¶ an argo-‚Ä¶‚Äù

Robert stopped to slap himself across the face with a resounding clap.

‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm an agronomist. It‚Äôs a project of mine.‚Äù

‚ÄúAn agronomist? Like‚Ä¶ crop research?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething like that, yeah.‚Äù

He chugged half a glass of water, pouring the rest onto a potted plant.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a mix of helianthus cerulea, and, uh‚Ä¶ cuscuta europea. European great dodder.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit out of my league,‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs‚Ä¶ amazing stuff. Looks complicated.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶most things are.‚Äù

&nbsp;

He sat down in a chair like his body was a dropped potato sack. I walked up to him and sat down on a chair across from him.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve amassed quite the debt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been asked to meet you to come up with a payment plan.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶debt?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúYou want money?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the gist of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù

&nbsp;

He opened a cabinet above his sink. I expected to see glasses and cups, but instead, there were stacks of cash. Not small bills either.

‚Äú‚Ä¶just, uh‚Ä¶ finished a project. I take all my payouts in cash, ‚Äòcause‚Ä¶ ‚Äòcause they run the banks, you know? Can‚Äôt trust the, uh‚Ä¶ yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat why you haven‚Äôt paid your bills? You don‚Äôt use banks anymore?‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I, uh‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ there‚Äôre more important things.‚Äù

He dropped a stack of cash in front of me. All $100 dollar bills. The kitchen table shook a little.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know agronomists make this much,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou seem to be doing well.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost don‚Äôt,‚Äù he sighed. ‚ÄúJust give me a number.‚Äù

&nbsp;

He paid the full amount, in one go, in cash. He didn‚Äôt even bat an eye. He signed whatever I pointed at with an ‚ÄòX‚Äô and didn‚Äôt ask any questions. I was given a plastic bag to carry the money in. As we finished, he yawned, revealing rows of deeply yellowed teeth.

‚ÄúAre we done?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúLooks like it,‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶ do you mind if I ask you something?‚Äù

‚ÄúShoot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with the sunflowers?‚Äù

&nbsp;

This gave him pause, but also seemed to focus him a bit.

‚ÄúThey, uh‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre allelopathic,‚Äù he said.

I gave him a blank look, and he caught on. I had no idea what he just said. He leaned against a wall, making the black plastic crinkle.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ all plants have their own survival strategies. Some spread pollen to the wind, others create seeds, or create nurturing juices for animals to eat and drop.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo. Allelopathic plants have a‚Ä¶ different strategy. They run a sort of interference. They release chemicals into the ground. Terpenoids, alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides‚Ä¶ whatever they need.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo do what?‚Äù

‚ÄúHm?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do they release it?‚Äù

He blinked at me, as if I‚Äôd asked him the most obvious question in the world.

‚ÄúTo kill the competition,‚Äù he said matter-of-factly. ‚ÄúTo make sure nothing else can, uh‚Ä¶ grow.‚Äù

&nbsp;

As I was about to leave, Robert waited by the door. I turned to him a final time.

‚ÄúYou really ought to help Elsie with her air conditioning,‚Äù I smiled. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs your plants messing it up to begin with, and it looks like you got plenty of spare cash.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, you have stacks of it in-‚Äú

‚ÄúNo, I, uh‚Ä¶ I mean the plants messing with the air conditioning. What do you mean by that?‚Äù

He squinted at me, tilting his head. His mouth left slightly ajar, revealing just how yellow those teeth really were.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ growing out of her air conditioning unit. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs wrong with it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs there,‚Äù I said with a shrug. ‚ÄúImpossible or not.‚Äù

&nbsp;

I turned to leave, but Robert grabbed my arm. He held me there for a second, looking distraught.

‚ÄúDid you see any of my boxes down there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúWere they open?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think so, yeah. She said she flushed the seeds. Sorry.‚Äù

Robert stopped to think for a minute, his eyes fluttering back and forth as silent calculations rushed through his head. Finally, he met my eyes.

‚ÄúThe air conditioning has a condensation drainage. It links with the plumbing system in the basement.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo they can stick to the side of the pipes. And with constant moisture and shade‚Ä¶‚Äù

His eyes widened. He held up a finger, as if asking me to wait, then nodded.

‚ÄúHold up a moment.‚Äù

He went back and got a couple more hundred dollar bills. He dropped them into my plastic bag with a thin smile.

‚ÄúFor your trouble.‚Äù

&nbsp;

As I got back in my car, I saw Robert standing outside his door, following me with his eyes every step of the way. He was eager for me to leave, that much I could tell. I didn‚Äôt know what to say or do, but I felt like I was missing something. I thought about calling the police, but there wasn‚Äôt anything inherently illegal going on as far as I could tell. Sure, he was a sketchy guy, but it‚Äôs not like he was making narcotics. Robert was just‚Ä¶ strange. And I couldn‚Äôt really tell if Elsie was missing by just not pestering us ‚Äì maybe she‚Äôd just went to the store?

I pulled out of the driveway, looking at him through the rear-view mirror. As soon as I was about to turn the corner, I could see him bursting into action. Whatever he was about to do, he was going to do it fast.

I tried putting it behind me, and to focus on my work.

&nbsp;

I was too busy with work to notice what happened next. I didn‚Äôt notice any of the sirens in the distance, and I couldn‚Äôt see the smoke. If I‚Äôd noticed it I might‚Äôve asked more questions, or prepared myself for something to come. But yeah, I had no idea that Robert had burned that house to the ground. I was busy filling out forms and preparing payment to be submitted.

I was staying at a roadside motel for the night further down the street. As I settled in and sent a couple of e-mails to my employer, I took some time to count, sort, and bag the payment appropriately. As I did, I noticed something crunchy at the bottom of the plastic bag that Robert had handed me.

Dry little pods. Seeds, possibly. They must‚Äôve slipped in by mistake.

&nbsp;

Catching a whiff of them, I couldn‚Äôt help but to sneeze. That smell of ammonia punched me in the face, tickling my nose. A couple of pods rolled out on the floor, while one remained in my spittle-covered hand.

It crackled as the leaves unfolded; awoken by the moisture. A thumb-sized little flower.

Still, I didn‚Äôt like it. If this had anything to do with Robert and his work, I didn‚Äôt want to go anywhere near it. I collected them carefully, rolled them up in a paper towel, and went to flush them.

I held them over the toilet, hesitating. This is what Elsie had done, and just thinking back on the look that Robert had given me when I told him was enough to make me reconsider. It was just one of those things, like getting worried when you break a mirror, or making sure you don‚Äôt step on cracks in the pavement. It was that little moment of doubt when all the doors are closed, and no one‚Äôs there to watch you.

I ended up rolling them up, stepping on them, and throwing the pieces in the trash.

&nbsp;

I managed to get about 30 minutes of sleep before there was a knock on my door. The motel owner was clearing people out. Apparently, there was a fire raging nearby and they didn‚Äôt want to risk anyone being caught unaware. We were offered a complementary stay at a different motel downtown. Sleep-deprived and exhausted, I agreed.

I got in my car and stayed off the main roads. I didn‚Äôt want to risk facing a speeding fire truck on a dimly lit road in the middle of the night; that was a recipe for disaster. I took the scenic route. I didn‚Äôt mind getting a complementary stay at another place. It might help me wash that smell of ammonia from my nose.

Driving down a dark country road in the middle of the night can be uncomfortable in and of itself, but as my engine began to stall, I felt all energy drain out of me. Just my luck.

&nbsp;

I popped the hood, using my phone as a flashlight. It took me a while to realize what I was even looking at.

Between the various pipes and cables were a tangled web of dried-out vines. All with their own little blue buds, waiting to pop at the slightest tingle of moisture. I waved some hot air out of my face just to survey the damage. How the hell had this even gotten there?

Someone must‚Äôve put it there. The only time someone would have access to my car without me noticing would be either at the motel, or while I was talking to Robert. And there was only one person nearby who wasn‚Äôt accounted for at that time.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúYou have our smell on you.‚Äù

An old voice overpowered the sizzling of the stalled engine. I didn‚Äôt have to turn around to know it was her, but I did. Robert‚Äôs neighbor, Elsie.

She‚Äôd been living in that place, infested with those plants, for weeks. So did Robert, but maybe he had the means to handle them. Elsie, on the other hand, didn‚Äôt.

Something had changed.

&nbsp;

I turned around to face her, holding my phone up. Touches of green wriggled at the edge of her eyelids. Tiny movements poking and prodding for weaknesses just beneath her skin. A myriad of twitching, hidden under the surface.

Her movements were jerky and sudden. Her voice hoarse and uneven; volume and cadence shifting at random. She was barefoot, wearing a night gown; her feet were blue from the cold. She didn‚Äôt seem to mind.

‚ÄúOur smell,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what are you talking about?‚Äù

Something moved behind me. I turned to face my car, only to see the vines in the engine rattling. Shaking, making the little dry buds rattle. A warning. A scream?

&nbsp;

Turning back to Elsie, she recoiled from the light. My hands were sweaty. She smiled, revealing a blackened tongue as she moved left and right; testing to see if I would follow her with my phone.

‚ÄúDo‚Ä¶ do you need me to call someone?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she wheezed. ‚ÄúPut that down. Call someone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho do you want me to call?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Part of me wanted to believe this was just a sick old woman, but another part of me knew there was more to it. She‚Äôd been living in that space, infested by God knows what. Maybe the air conditioning was just a sign of something worse.

She didn‚Äôt approach, instead moving side to side. We circled one-another as she tried to reach the end of my light.

‚ÄúI wanted to see you,‚Äù she grinned. ‚ÄúWhile you slept.‚Äù

She made an outburst forward, almost tripping over her own feet. I stepped back, feeling my heart skip a beat.

‚ÄúWhat do you want?!‚Äù I cried out.

‚ÄúI like the smell.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Another outburst, but this time, she collapsed face forward into the pavement. As her body came down with a smack, there was a blood-curdling noise coming from her arm. It had snapped. But not just snapped as in broken; it had come off from her body completely.

And it was still moving.

Little nerve endings and arteries replaced by green vines, keeping the host alive and kicking. Twitches making the muscles come to life, contracting and expanding to lurch blindly forward. Elsie didn‚Äôt seem to mind as she rolled over and got back up; her missing arm making her lopsided.

I wanted to say something, but words failed me. I just shook my head, as if trying to force what I was seeing out of my head.

&nbsp;

Fingers from her severed hand tapped against my boot, trying to grab me. I shuddered as I kicked it off, watching it flop into the ditch. Looking up, I saw Elsie sprinting at me.

I barely had time to react before she body slammed me into the side of the car, breaking my side view mirror and dropping me to the ground. I gasped for air as a hand pushed down on my neck. At first, it was just fingers. Then, something more. Dry little strings, oozing of blood and ammonia, tightening around my throat like a noose.

‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she laughed. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

&nbsp;

She picked up her arm and placed it on my neck. With every movement I made, it clamped down. I was to remain perfectly still and docile, or this would be the end of me. Grabbing me by my foot, she dragged me off the side of the road; leaving my car abandoned in the street.

Looking back at it, I can‚Äôt say anything was going through my head. I was blackout panicked, and my body just sort of‚Ä¶ froze.

I have vague flashes of memory from being dragged down the street. The chafing on my back. Ther intermittent light from the occasional working streetlight. Watching the back of Elsie‚Äôs night gown and the various unnatural bits and pieces move underneath the fabric.

&nbsp;

There were a couple of times where cars passed us by, but Elsie was far enough off the road for no one to see us at a casual glance. I was being dragged through the weeds, and she didn‚Äôt wear any colors that stood out.

She kept repeating this one thing, over and over. It wasn‚Äôt directed at me, really, but just‚Ä¶ something she said.

‚ÄúMaking a home.‚Äù

Like she was reminding herself what she was doing. She‚Äôd get these violent tics at times, jerking her head to the right. It looked painful, like she might accidentally hurt her neck.

&nbsp;

We made our way back toward her home, street by street. She took shortcuts, moving through the woods when she could. She didn‚Äôt care what she stepped on, or what she had to drag me through; as long as we made our way forward.

I was battered and bruised all over when I could finally see the firetrucks in the distance through the treeline. Elsie stopped, tilting her head with a squint.

‚ÄúLooks‚Ä¶ looks like it‚Äôs been an accident,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúT-there‚Äôs smoke.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she stated. ‚ÄúHome is safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt look like it.‚Äù

‚ÄúHome is safe!‚Äù

She turned to me, letting her eyes roll back into her skull. Her jaw unhinged, spewing forward a fistful of green vines reaching out from the back of her throat; vibrating and rattling, like a threatened viper.

&nbsp;

I took the opportunity to throw off the hand from my neck and crawled away. I didn‚Äôt get far. I grabbed a fallen log but couldn‚Äôt hold on for long before she pulled me loose. This time, she wasn‚Äôt holding back. There was an immense strength in that old woman; far more than anticipated.

She leaned over me, pulling my face closer. The little green vines were close enough to tap against my nose, as if looking for something to grab onto. I pushed back, but there was no use.

Even now, she was laughing.

&nbsp;

They were so close I could hear the vines brushing against me.

I felt her muscles contract. This was gonna be the final push.

Then, a bang.

And another one.

I felt her hands go slack, and I managed to push myself away. Two more loud bangs followed, and Elsie fell over.

A hand reached out to me, and I took it. I got back on my feet to see Robert Corace with a worn-down revolver.

&nbsp;

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI, uh‚Ä¶ had to make sure.‚Äù

Before I had the time to respond, he was sprinkling lighter fluid on her. As I mouthed the word ‚Äòwait‚Äô, she was already up in flames. Robert pulled me back.

‚ÄúComing back here meant this was her nest. There‚Äôs no spread, so we‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?!‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you!‚Äù he shouted back. ‚ÄúAllelopathy! Once they take root, they want destroy all others! You think that just goes for some potted plants in my bedroom?!‚Äù

He looked back at the burning wreckage of the townhouse at the edge of the trees.

‚ÄúI had to be sure. So I needed bait. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

&nbsp;

Turns out, Robert had put those buds in the plastic bag by design. He‚Äôd suspected his neighbor of having been affected, but he‚Äôd been trying to ignore it for some time ‚Äì hoping against hope to be wrong. Those seeds were potent; adding a sort of marker on me. Something powerful enough for someone infected to be unable to resist.

Robert hoped she would attack me.

And she did.

&nbsp;

I met up with Robert the next day. I needed a full explanation. In return, I agreed to keep some of it to myself.

Robert had been working on a strain of helianthus cerulea, just as he said. What he hadn‚Äôt said was that it was a modified strain. Not even Robert knew the real origins, it was just something granted to him by his shady employer.

His original debt had been an attempt to cash out and flee the country. His employer managed to catch up with him, putting him back into solitary forced labor. Work from home, yes, but under close supervision.

But Robert hadn‚Äôt anticipated that Elsie would flush his samples. He‚Äôd be getting so many boxes that one slipped off his radar. While Robert was taking supplements to resist a possible infection, Elsie wasn‚Äôt. As the plant spread through the water and air, she was getting more affected by the day ‚Äì until it finally spilled over.

&nbsp;

One year later, I see them sometimes. In videos, or in the occasional background of a photo. Sometimes I just think I see them; it‚Äôs like the color just jumps out at me.

But every now and then, I notice the real deal, and I can‚Äôt help but to wonder how far it‚Äôs nested.

After soaking the mopani wood and lava rock, they were added in. Which definitely kicked up some substrate again. After the water cleared, I added in my first real plants. 2 anubias nanas, and a patch of dwarf grass. (Then I impulse bought a piece of drift wood w/mystery moss and a moss ball w/Java fern)

After the tank cleared up (again) I put in some plant food and quick start to get things moving. After being stuck at 1ppm ammonia for a few days, I added more beneficial bacteria. Which may have also caused my cyanobacteria and algae bloom which I'm still currently handling :/ I put in my first dose of blue green algae surface stain remover (April 18) and I'm hoping what is said about it is true... What stinks is this outbreak is happening just as my dwarf grass began to grow rapidly (last pic shows start of grass growth).

569,https://www.reddit.com/r/ponds/comments/1c7l7zh/the_kazzy_filter_my_cheap_and_easy_design_for/,The Kazzy Filter - My cheap and easy design for turning Green water clear," 

Back in 2012 I rescued some giant goldfish from Craigslist. They were huge, and crammed into a filthy dirty tank. I built a pond for them out of an 8 foot stock tank. But for years it was plagued with green water. Thick green water. I couldn't see the fish at all.

I tried many different approaches. Different plants, water lilies, water fall, water celery, etc. I tried that skippy filter that other rave about. That thing would just clog up and barely work, it's honestly a bad design. Sure it would clear it for a little bit, but kept going back to green and clogging and needing cleaning.

I didn't want to spend a ton of money and have some elaborate overdone pricy and bulky mess of a filter that still needed constant attention and cleaning. And expensive repair work.

After years of experimenting this is what I came up with. I combined a bunch of styles, all into one kind of compact and cheap set up. Easy to build.

It a shower filter, a mechanical filter, bio filter, and plant filter all in one.

The first day it already started getting cleaner. And by a week it was totally clean, I think it might have taken a couple weeks to be crystal clear. The fish kept having babies, and the pond was massively over stocked, but it never turned green again. The fish were healthy and happy.

**1:** Get a small **stock tank** or container

**2:** Drill holes in the bottom, so it can shower out of into another tank or, stream or pond.

**3:** Dump a load of **lava rock** in it

**4:** Lay a bunch of that **blue filter material** over the lava rock (you can get it from home depot) - Leave some areas on the side open, at first the water will go right through the filter material, eventually it builds up with beneficial bacteria, and algae, and starts to overflow. Don't worry about that. It's still working. It's catching algae, and it's dying, and breaks down. It's also growing a whole bio system. But any extra flow now flows over to the sides, which is fine. Oh I forgot I threw a bunch of those **green scrubby pads** in there too.

**5:** At the top, shower or distribute the water over it.

**6:** For best results get some **yellow flag iris water plants**. That stuff grows like crazy. It can be anywhere, but I got another bigger stock tank and put it in that, and set the smaller one on top to shower down in it.

The Yellow Flag iris likes some sand or dirt. Apparently you can even put milk crates in there and set them in bare root. That would probably work best, but mine were hard to get started at first and tiny, so I put some dirt and sand in. Ideally you want it to flow right through the roots, but mine was in the dirt at first, eventually the roots grew out all above the dirt and cleaned the water and soaked up the nitrates (or nitrites?).

Yellow flag Iris can totally freeze solid and still be fine. So they are fine in winter.

The only problem I had was the yellow flag Iris got so thick I had to cut a hole through it so the water didn't get backed up.

Maybe only once a year or so you could just hose off the blue filter material, otherwise don't touch it! It looks all filled up, but that is fine. It will flow off the sides and keep doing it's thing. Don't mess up the bio community it's got going on. You can see how dark and nasty it looks after a while in the photos, it's fine, don't touch it.

I figure you can adapt this to any bigger pond. The actual shower filter stock tank is pretty small (2 feet  I  think?). It's the plant one that is bigger. So yeah the extra 4' plant stock tank looks a bit big and gaudy, but you can put the plants anywhere downstream and leave out that bigger stock tank. Or hide it better.

Anyway, even though it's an amalgam of systems, I figured it would help to give it a name and makes it easier for others to find it and copy it if they want to try it. So I called it Kazzy filter (just part of my name).

**Photos:** The first few photos were my attempt at just making a plant filter. I probably did a hundred other iterations of a filter first. None worked very well. The problem is the Algae seems to get the nutrients first and then there is no way to filter the algae. The water got so bad one hot summer day that it killed one of my giant goldfish. Sometimes in winter other solutions would be fine. Off and on. But nothing worked well or for long.

I eventually found it best to remove any plants from the main pond and have more water area for my fish. Anyway, as you can see it cleared up in a week or so, even though the iris was still tiny, it wasn't doing much of anything yet, but the shower filter was working great to trap algae and work as a bio filter. Eventually the Water Iris grew into a monster. The water looked very polished.

My parameters have been perfect for the last 8 weeks but since Feb, I keep getting this algae growing and cannot get rid of it. I've tried to lower how much light per day (down to 4 hours for a week). Feed a pinch of food every 3 days and water changes 30 minutes after a feeding of 3 gallons but I cannot get this taken care of. I did pull out my rocks, wood, heater and sponge on the filter and cleaned them off completely but it came back. I also bought snails and currently have about 15 in there (started with 4) and they helped clean up some of the algae but I do not think they touched this stuff. Anyone have a guess of what I can do? I do have live plants, snails, 2 female betas and 13 black neon tetras. I know it's a large amount of fish but under normal conditions, I'm doing water changes on Mondays and Fridays almost religiously and have no issues with any of the parameters.

I had some kind of crash or problem with the water in my mature 55 gallon tank. There was a marked increase in the growth of alge or blue-green slime, and my fish started behaving strangely.

I treated for the slime and did a bunch of water changes and pruned some plants, but still lost the 2 smallest of my 4 angelfish, which was really heartbreaking. Despite measuring 0 ppm for nitrates, nitrates, and ammonia, the two larger ones started acting oddly, too, but seem to have mostly recovered. I saw a small amount of white spots on their tailfins, so decided to treat for ich.

Last Tue I increased the tank temp to 28C did the first dose with Super Ick Cure:

[https://apifishcare.com/product/super-ick-cure](https://apifishcare.com/product/super-ick-cure)

Then on Thu after 48h I did a water change and a second dose, and then on Sat a large water change (30%), and on Sun a smaller one (20%).

I still see some white spots on the tailfins of both fish - and they are still not feeding nearly as well as they used to. Water levels look good, plants are good, algae/slime growth is under control.

I've raised the temp to 28.5C while I decide what to do next. Is another round of Super Ick Cure a good idea, or should I wait more?

Any advice or info on this would be much appreciated. I'm really broken up about losing the 2 smaller fish and really want to get the remaining fish back to full health.",16 Apr 2024 13:31:35,reddit

I hit it with some hydrogen peroxide with the tank off and didnt seem to do anything, now it is all over the moss. 75 gallon planted tank (see overall pic for types of plants) , 0 ammonia, 0 nitrite, 10 ppm nitrate. Ph is higher than I want it at 7.6 but out of c02 until tomorrow typically i hover in the 7.0-7.2 range - using peat in the filter to help since I have 7.9 ph from the tap.  All during the cycle I ran the heater at 75 but ""green aqua"" on youtube recommends no heater if you can maintain 20-22¬∞ C with ambient air temp. 4 days without a heater and I'm hovering around 72.9- 73¬∞f 

Running fluval planted 3.0 light 7 hours a day - no blue lights at anytime in the light cycle, fluval bio c02 but just changed the mixture and now have to wait 24 hours before c02 is released, dosing thrive all in one copper free fertilizer 1-2x a week. Fluval stratum planted substrate with a crushed coal cap (I've ran the coal for years in my African cichlid tank with zero issues -don't @me)  typically I would run the c02 for about an hour before the lights came on, after listening to green aqua on youtube I attempted to do 2 hours before light came on but ran out of c02.

579,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c3yo52/stanville_creek/,Stanville Creek,"I sat next to the weird kid on the first day of middle school.

During first period, as the teacher droned on about timetables, he incrementally shifted his chair towards me and whispered in my ear.

""There's a murderer in this town. Did you know that?""

My family had just moved to the town from a different state, and had less than a week to settle in before school began. I was a small, timid twelve year old girl with big glasses, joining as a new student in the seventh grade. The type that wouldn‚Äôt talk unless I was spoken to, and do exactly what I was told. The gullible type to naively take everything at face value. I never had many friends, and I figured my prospects weren't great at this new school either. All the kids had a year to know each other already, and friendship groups seemed pretty much formed. Still, I was observant to their interactions, enough to realise this kid was most definitely the outcast.

Too anxious to look at him, I stared wide-eyed towards the front and shook my head slowly.

""It's true,"" he continued. ""He's got long, sharp crooked teeth and smells of pee and rotten fish. One of his eyes is missing, he's just got an empty socket there.""

Ironically, pee and rotten fish was exactly what this kid smelled like. I tried not to breathe in as he leaned in even closer. *He's sensing my fear*, I thought, as I tried to stay as still as possible. Nobody else seemed to notice us at the back of the class next to the window.

""If he catches you alone, he'll grab you and take you somewhere no-one will find you. He'll shove things in your butt hole from where you poop‚Ä¶"" He made a scratching sound with the end of his ruler on my desk, c*rrk ck crrk ck*. I crossed my legs tightly as I cringed in my seat. ""And laugh when you scream. When he's had his fun, he'll cut you up and dump you in Stanville Creek. If you don't believe me, I can show you later. You can see bones in there if you look closely.""

Stanville Creek was a pond in a wooded area of town. On the way to school and back from my house, there was a sign pointing to a trail that disappeared into the depths of the woods. It read '*S.ville Creek 1.5mi*', indicating that it was a 1.5 mile walk away into that dark abyss. I later found out that it wasn't really a creek *per se*, just a large stagnant body of water inhabited by a lot of wildlife. The misnomer originated from its previous branching into the town's main river, but industrial works had somehow isolated it.

He poked my face with the sharp end of the pencil, and I accidentally let out a loud yelp.

""Stop messing around at the back,"" shouted the teacher. Everyone turned to look at us, and my face flushed red.

The weird kid moved his seat back, grinning at me from ear to ear. I glanced at him for the first time. He was pale and lanky, with long, greasy black hair that almost covered his eyes and ran in strips down to his shoulders at the back. A snot booger hung from his left nostril. He had dark eyebrows and wore a green sweatshirt that was too big for him, with untied laces trailing from his dirt-covered black and white sneakers.

For the rest of the day, he would periodically stick his tongue out at me and make scratching noises with a pencil on his desk. At lunch, he sat alone on a bench and kept staring at me. When it came time to go home, he was waiting to torment me again at the school gate.

""The murderer's gonna get you,"" he mumbled as I walked past. ""He likes little girls just like you. You're not gonna make it home today."" Terror engulfed me and my knees went weak. I backtraced my steps to the school gate and stared at him with bulging eyes.

""Scaredy cat,"" he mumbled, and started walking away. Instinctively, I followed him.

*The killer can't take me if I'm not alone*, I thought. He turned around.

""Stop following me,"" he growled. He kept walking, I kept following him, and he turned around again. A wicked idea popped into his mind, and he flashed a grin.

""Wanna hear a story?""

I looked at him blankly, which he evidently took as a *'yes'*. He continued walking. I noticed he had a slight limp as I followed behind him.

""About fifty years ago, there was a really nice teacher working at our school called Mrs Derry. She actually taught in our class. Anyway, she married one of the other teachers and they had three kids who went to the school. One day, they got divorced and he got the kids. They all told her she had to leave the school on the last day of that year. When the next year started, she wasn't there..."" He paused for dramatic effect. ""Guess where she went.""

""Um, a different school?"" I said quietly.

""Nope.""

""A new job?""

""Nope.""

""A different country?""

""Wrong again. On the first day, a girl noticed a bad smell coming from the storage room outside the lunch hall. You know, the one with the door painted red. She opened the door to have a look‚Ä¶"" He paused again dramatically, as I remembered walking past that same red door earlier. ""‚Ä¶And she saw Mrs Derry's dead rotting corpse, hanging from her neck off the ceiling."" He grinned as my eyes widened, gleeful as he watched the psychological damage he had inflicted with a single sentence.

I was walking shakily on autopilot, still trailing behind him. I inched closer to him as we walked past the 'S.ville Creek' sign. It was only fifteen minute walk back to my place. If my house hadn't been on the way to his, I probably would've ended up following him home.

""I‚Ä¶ I'm gonna go now,"" I trembled, as we walked past my house. He ignored me and just kept walking away. I looked around like a deer and sprinted up the front steps, where my mom let me in.

""Hey sweetie, how was your first day?""

""Good,"" I said, still trembling. I walked briskly past her and up the stairs to my room, curling up in a ball on the floor. All I could think about that night was what I would find if I opened that red door outside the lunch hall, and how someone could die by being hanged from their neck.

The next day, I sat beside the weird kid again, whose name was Will. He kept making faces at me every time I looked in his direction. Thankfully, we had different classes later in the morning. But even when he wasn't there, it was as if he had infested my mind. I still couldn't concentrate, and kept thinking about the serial killer and the teacher he'd told me about yesterday. At lunch, I walked past the dreaded storage room, and stood outside the red door for a moment. I heard Will's voice behind me.

""I dare you to open it,"" he grinned. ""Hey, I'll give you a fiver if you open it.""

I reached for the handle, being in my nature to do as I was told. He came closer. In that moment, we were alone in the corridor. I turned the handle and pulled the door open just wide enough. Suddenly, I felt a strong push behind me. I stumbled into the storage room, and the door slammed behind me as footsteps darted away.

It was pitch black in there. A foul, sweaty odor marinated in the warm humidity. I gagged and banged on the door as I fumbled around for the handle, but couldn't open the door no matter how hard I tried. It slowly dawned on me that I was locked inside a room where someone had hanged themselves. I looked into the darkness. Then I heard the sound of something swinging, looked up and thought I saw a mangled, decomposed face looking down at me with a noose around its neck. I began screaming.

""Help, HELP! *HELP ME!*"" I shrieked.

I banged on the inside of the door as hard as I could, but no one came to save me. I kept shrieking for a good ten minutes, banging with my hands and elbows like my life depended on it, which I thought it did. Finally, it opened.

I fell into the cleaning lady's arms, pale and hyperventilating. My knuckles were beaten raw.

""My goodness, how did you get in there?""

""I‚Ä¶ got stuck,"" I said, dazed.

""You poor thing."" She patted my head and left.

Will greeted me again at the school gates, a sick grin plastered on his face. I wanted to avoid him, but at the same time, I was now deathly afraid of walking home alone.

""That was hilarious,"" he laughed, ""Did you even hear yourself? You sounded like a dying monkey. Or a dolphin, or something.""

I grimaced as we started walking.

""So, did you see a dead body in there?"" He taunted.

I nodded.

""Really? Well you better hope it's not hiding under your bed tonight."" He smirked. I remained silent as ever. We walked for a minute, then he suddenly stopped and pointed at a window of the hospital close to the school.

""There's an old woman living in that room, right there,"" he said. ""She's lying down so you can't see her, but sometimes she'll sit up and stare at you out the window, with a hundred tubes coming out of her and all."" He motioned with his hands as I looked away quickly.

""Then,"" he continued, ""when the sun sets, she sometimes climbs out of the window and finds people walking alone on the street. Kids, adults, old people, anyone. Then she claws out their necks with her nails and sucks their blood until they're dry.""

My middle school days pretty much continued like this. I was traumatized for a while after the storage room incident, but I was afraid that Will do something worse if I tried to avoid him. Or that a serial killer would get me if I walked alone, ironically, an idea he had planted in my mind. So I was stuck with him. He waited for me at the end of every school day by the gate, and would have a new horrifying and totally age-inappropriate story to terrorize me with, based on random places we passed in the town.

His stories progressively got wilder and more creative.

""You see this bridge? There was a problem with it just a few years ago. They didn't build it quite right. A pregnant woman was walking on it one day, and it snapped. She fell into the river and drowned with her baby.""

""Some kids went into that field for a camping trip and they never came back. Turns out, one of them got bitten by a wolf with rabies, and he started biting the others. They all died slowly and painfully, knowing they were dying but couldn't do anything about it. 'Cuz you know, rabies makes you go mad.""

He sometimes sprinkled in the odd horrific 'fact'.

""If you cut someone's head off, they can still blink for five minutes.""

""About a million kids get kidnapped every year. Did you know that?""

He always made it a point to meet me at the school gate every day, and over time it became our ritual. He was sick one day and didn't attend school, but he made it to the gate at the usual school finishing time with a fever and sore throat, and walked straight back with me, informing me that some teachers in our school were spying on me at night or something. There was no way he'd miss a single opportunity to torment me, probably the highlight of his otherwise solitary day.

I can't pinpoint exactly when my fear subsided and gave way to intrigue and entertainment. As I learned more about the world and realized not everything you hear is necessarily true, I began exploring the town, sometimes with my parents, and even with a new friend from the same math class on the weekends. Yes, I somehow made a friend, and we bonded over the fact that we both wore glasses. My dad took me to visit the hospital when he had a checkup. I discovered the room with the old lady was just an admin office. My friend and I went to the field where the campers went missing, apparently. There were no dead bodies foaming at the mouth, and no rabid wolves. One day, I even opened the red storage room door again. I was obviously seeing things in my panic when I had been locked in there - nothing but a bunch of tools and cleaning supplies, with a conveniently placed mop that could've been mistaken for a head in the dark.

Moving from seventh to eighth grade, I was surprised to find myself looking forward to our walks back home. Will caught onto my newfound scepticism and figured the standard horror stories wouldn't cut it anymore. He changed tact quickly.

""Look, that's Ben's house. You know Ben in our class? You know why he's so fat? His mom's a butcher, and sometimes she puts kids' meat in his pies and makes sausages out of them for dinner. A kid in the year below disappeared last year, I think he ate him. So yeah, anyway, that's why you shouldn't talk to him anymore.""

He had really turned into a comedian.

We became *somewhat* friends. We even started having 'normal' conversations periodically - stuff about school work and other kids in the class.

He stopped abruptly one day, when we walked past the S.Ville Creek sign.

""You ever been down there?""

""No,"" I replied. Of all the places in town, Stanville Creek was the only one I couldn't bring myself to visit in our small, relatively safe town that I had begun settling into. I never suggested going there to anyone, but I would think about what was down there often. At this point, I doubted there was actually a serial killer dumping bodies in there, but I just felt uneasy about it. Perhaps it was because that was my first introduction to the town, so I was still subconsciously afraid and couldn't control that. I couldn't put my finger on it.

""Come on, let's go then.""

""I don't know,"" I said.

""What, you scared?"" He sneered, ""Come on, don't tell me you actually think there's dead people there.""

I shrugged.

""You can hold my hand?"" He held his hand out, but I shook my head. ""Fine, whatever."" I was surprised he didn't drag me down there. We kept walking, silent for a while before we got close to my house.

""You know all the shit I told you last year was fake, right?"" He paused. ""You do know that, right?""

""I figured,"" I replied.

""Just checking."" He walked off without a goodbye, but I was used to that now. I watched him head off onto the next road, the ever present limp in his stride.

On the last day of eighth grade, school ended early. I had last period with Will that day, and was expecting to leave with him as usual.

""They've built this new lounge place on the second floor, I'm gonna check it out,"" he said, and bolted into the hallway then up the stairs without warning. I naturally went up too. They had some bean bags, soccer balls, a playstation and DVDs.

""Wanna watch a scary movie?"" He grinned.

""No.""

""Cool.""

He immediately picked up Friday the 13th and slotted it into the DVD player. I sat on one of the bean bags at the opposite end of the room.

""So, we're going to different high schools I guess. Who you gonna follow around when I'm gone?""

""I'll just have to find someone else,"" I shrugged. He looked disappointed for a second, but the expression faded quickly.

""Fair enough.""

Colored lines and pixels flashed across the grainy screen.

""This piece of shit's broken,"" he complained, as the screen went neon blue.

Silence reigned. He turned to look at me, illuminated by the blue glow. I realized he looked different to when I first saw him. He was taller. His hair was cut shorter, and he wasn't as scrawny. Even the snot that faithfully hung from his nostril before was gone now. Perhaps the changes had been so incremental that I'd barely noticed, after seeing him every day for the majority of two years.

""Why don't you stink of piss anymore?"" I asked. I know, what a question. For some reason, it felt right to say in the moment.

""I discovered what a shower was. Thanks for noticing."" He mumbled.

""You're welcome.""

""Why didn't you tell anyone I locked you in the storage room?""

His question caught me off guard. I took a second to think, and came to the conclusion I was afraid of what he might do to me at the time, if he found out I told someone.

""I‚Ä¶ I don't know.""

He just looked down.

""I get that. Well, good thing you didn't.""

""Good for you."" I rolled my eyes.

""If you tell anyone about it, I'll have to shut you back inside.""

""It's fine,"" I shrugged, ""there's no dead lady in there.""

""You didn't sound fine."" He scoffed.

""Shut up. I'm leaving."" I got up, and this time *he* followed me down the stairs and out of the empty school halls.

""I know the stuff you told me last year, you know, about the teacher and stuff, was all fake,"" I began, ""but how did you come up with those stories? I mean, some of that stuff really scared me.""

""That's 'cuz I was trying to,"" he snorted, ""but not all of it is completely fake. I came up with pretty much all of them from something I saw, but wasn't nearly as interesting. I‚Ä¶ have trouble falling asleep most nights. I just lie in bed and come up with stories and stuff in my head to help me sleep.""

""How do they help you sleep?"" I asked, ""Wouldn't they keep you awake?""

""Nah, that's if you actually find them scary. I don't. They're just fun to think about, and before I know it, I've drifted off. The teacher-who-hanged-herself story,"" he continued, ""well, actually there *was* a nice teacher who taught our class in sixth grade before you came, and she actually *was* called Mrs Derry. And she actually *was* married to another teacher at school. She was the only one who really talked to me. So when she divorced him and left out of nowhere, I felt kind of angry. Maybe making up a story about her killing herself was a bit too far, but I didn't want to think she'd left me here alone.

And the one about the old woman in the hospital? That was based off my grandma. She actually died of cancer. She went mad before she died, and it freaked me out. Lost her mind. I thought the only thing scarier than her was if she started climbing out the windows like Spiderman and became a vampire.

The pregnant woman that fell off the bridge? That‚Ä¶"" He paused, ""That was based off my mom. She got pregnant and just left one day. That was five years ago now. I think she cheated on my stepdad. Haven't heard from her since. I don't know if she died or whatever, but I think it would be better if she did. I mean, I didn't want to think she left me on purpose. I hoped she had an accident or something instead, like, something she couldn't control that forced her to leave, instead of actually wanting to do it, you know?""

His voice sounded strained.

""I'm sorry,"" I said quietly.

""Whatever,"" he said nonchalantly, ""it's in the past. You don't need to feel bad for me or anything.""

I continued to listen as he debunked the rest of the stories he had told me.

The campers that died of rabies story was inspired by some kids he didn't like who went on a field trip. The story about the teachers spying on students - that had happened once in another school, the teacher was just a pervert and got fired. It wasn't the elaborate surveillance scheme he made it out to be. The one about Ben was because he was a big kid that bullied him for a while.

""So that's where that all came from,"" I said.

""So now you know.""

""What about the one about the murderer at Stanville Creek? What's that based off of?""

He looked surprised, hesitating for a second as if he'd forgotten the explanation.

""Actually, that was the only one I made up from scratch. I just wanted to make up the most horrifying thing I could imagine to scare you with it,"" he laughed. ""You really think the adults would let you walk home alone if there was an actual serial killer in town?""

""Guess not,"" I said. We stopped, as I had reached my house, and it dawned on me that this was our last walk back home.

""Will,"" I said, with a firm tone. He looked at me. ""You've got to come to my fourteenth birthday party at my house. It's on Saturday.""

""I told you this last year,"" he sighed, sounding frustrated, ""I can't.""

""Why not?""

""I just can't.""

""This might be the last time I see you for a while. Can't you try or something?"" I pleaded.

He glanced down, then to the side for a moment, and finally back at me.

""Fine,"" he said. ""I'll be there.""

He flashed a rare smile.

""Okay!"" I ran inside excitedly as he turned and continued onwards.

My parents were eager for me to have my first proper birthday party. I'd gone to places with them before to celebrate, but never really had a one with friends. They were probably worried I had no friends at all. There were only four people invited to the party, but I was really just excited to see Will outside of school for once. I was certain he would show up.

But he never did. I waited anxiously the whole day, and when my friends left, disappointment overwhelmed me.

""Aw, sweetie. Did you tell him it was today?"" asked mom.

""Don't take it personally,"" said dad.

As night came, the disappointment slowly grew into concern. I couldn't shake off the feeling that something bad had happened. Maybe he forgot. Maybe he decided not to come. Most likely one of the two. But I had known Will for two years. Despite his abrasive, cold attitude, I realized that he never failed to show up at the school gate, not even once, to walk me home. The conviction in his tone when he agreed to come to the party made me absolutely *sure* he would be there. Something wasn't right.

I woke up at 2am in a cold sweat. I had to go to Stanville Creek.

I didn't know why, or what I was looking for. I just an undeniable gut feeling that I would find answers there. The impulse was too strong be ignored, and it took over me completely. I tiptoed past my parents, sound asleep in their room. I didn't bother to wake them. They would make me wait until daylight, and in that moment, there was no waiting. I put on my coat and grabbed a flashlight, then slipped out of the house into the dark street, blasting into a sprint. I felt my pulse bound in my temples as I ran as fast as I possibly could.

For the first time, I traversed the sign that said ""S.Ville Creek 1.5mi"" and descended into the depths of the woods without fear or hesitation. *What am I thinking?* I thought, in my confused, panicked sprint. *Why am I running out here, alone at night? Why am I so sure I'll find something here?* I couldn't answer those questions. All I could do was keep running down the trail.

I finally arrived at Stanville Creek. I aimed my flashlight at the circular pond, with a diameter around thirty yards, thin forest surrounding the area. Lily pads floated on the surface, green algae strewn across the stagnant water. The moon and stars reflected faintly. It was quiet and serene, apart from the sound of my own breath and crickets. Nothing sinister - no bodies or blood in the water. Just sleeping nature.

Not much to see after all. *Not sure why I even came here*, I thought, but it was kind of worth it. At the very least, I just felt relieved and partly accomplished that I had literally confronted my biggest fear to date. I walked a little around the perimeter on the grass, and stood still for a second to appreciate the feeling of being alone there. *Hopefully mom and dad are still asleep so they don't tell me off for sneaking out*, I thought, as I turned to leave. My urge had been satisfied.

I whipped my flashlight around, but aimed it back at something that suddenly caught my attention. Something black and angular next to the base of a tree that looked out of place in the distance. I walked towards it and as I approached, recognized that it was a large black suitcase. Figuring someone had dumped it as trash, I looked at it for a while before I pinched the zipper and tugged on it, unzipping it halfway out of curiosity.

Something slipped out, and it took me a second to register that it was a human hand.

I don't remember much of what happened immediately after that. It's still a hazy blur, even after my parents put me through two months of therapy. According to them, I burst in through the front door screaming at them to call the police, that there was a body in a suitcase. The remains were promptly investigated and discovered.

Before the policemen even sent the body for identification, I told them it had to be my friend Will. They asked me how I was so sure, and I told them I wasn't sure myself. I was only able to piece it all together years later, after the reports came out.

On the afternoon Will had agreed to come to my party, he made a decision after we parted ways. Instead of going home, he headed to the police station. He headed there to report years of daily SA against him by his stepfather, who warned him that if he ever told anyone, he would be dismembered and thrown into Stanville Creek. Unfortunately, his stepdad was driving home on a nearby road and spotted him walking in the opposite direction to their house. They got into a confrontation. The exact details are still murky, but all I know is that it resulted in Will being murdered by his stepdad.

His stepdad was a tall, overweight man with long, sharp crooked teeth that stank of piss and rotten fish. He had one of his eyes surgically removed from a disease in his childhood, and wore a patch over the empty socket. As soon as he was arrested he admitted everything - the almost daily rape of his stepson for over five years after the departure of his ex-wife, and the eventual murder.

I blamed myself for a long time. Despite talking to Will every day, I realized how little I really knew about him. I never asked why he couldn't go to other people's houses, or on school trips. I blamed myself for not recognizing the signs. Above all, the stories he used as a coping mechanism for the horrors he endured in real life. As he walked me home safely every day, he returned to face those horrors alone every night.

And how blind I was, to overlook that the first and most disturbing story he ever told me could never have been conjured up out of thin air.

I moved to a new town after high school, and life was good. I have two kids of my own now, aged seven and ten. My favorite thing to do is tell them stories as I walk them home from school. It reminds me of those middle school days I miss every so often, looking forward to a new story as I walked home with a real friend, who hid secrets I could never have guessed as he kept me company. Sometimes I'll tell my kids a scary story in honor of those times - something age appropriate of course, but still jarring enough to remind them to be vigilant about the very real evil that lurks in our world.

And someday I'll tell them this story, but that'll have to wait a [while.](https://www.reddit.com/user/latebutstillearly1/)",14 Apr 2024 13:16:50,reddit
580,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c3mmd3/we_came_across_a_buoy_moving_through_the_waves_it/,We came across a buoy moving through the waves. It was attached to something horrifying,"‚ÄúYo, Perry, I‚Äôve got a bite!‚Äù


  
I lifted my eyes from the water to see Kevin yanking back with all his might. The fishing rod my friend was holding suddenly bent, almost in half as the sound of the line rapidly spooling out filled the air, almost drowning out the sound of the gulls crying overhead. A look of determination entered his face as he reached to lock the reel, and bracing his legs, he let out a battle cry and flipped the switch. A moment later, he was almost pulled off his paddleboard and straight into the frigid Atlantic as the fish on the other end strained to escape. Veins began to stand out on his arms as he used every ounce of muscle in his body to match its ferocity.


  
He shot a quick look up at me, a grin splitting across his face. ‚ÄúAnd it feels like one hell of a big son of a bitch to boot!‚Äù For my part, I simply shook my head and gave a half-smile at the man‚Äôs overdramatic tone, as if he were boasting about hooking Moby Dick himself. *More than likely, he‚Äôs got himself a good sized striper; a large bluefish at most*. Even still, I called out to him. ‚ÄúYou all good, or do you need a hand?‚Äù He shook his head as he reeled in a few feet of line and turned away from me, following the struggling fish as it swung towards shore. ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôve got this!‚Äù he yelled back, ‚ÄúKeep your eyes on your own line. We may have a school of whatever this is passing under us!‚Äù


  
Grunting to acknowledge I‚Äôd heard him, I turned away to gaze back at my line, which disappeared out of sight into the dark blue, almost black depths. Reaching out, I gently gripped it with my thumb and forefinger to feel if there was any tension beyond the stir of the current. Even the slightest tug could signify a curious fish nibbling. To my disappointment, though, I felt nothing. *Nothing for the last hour and a half*. I cast a quick and somewhat bitter look over at Kevin as he continued to haul up his prize from below. *Lucky bastard always ends up being the one to catch anything during the spring months. The summer may be my time to shine, but in spring, he‚Äôs the clear winner*.


  
Kevin and I had grown up together in the small town of Camden, Maine, meeting for the first time during roll call in elementary school. Bonding over a mutual love of the ocean, Sega Dreamcast and 70s horror movies, we‚Äôd instantly hooked onto each other. And it had been that way ever since, even as the years had passed and we‚Äôd grown. I was now staring down the barrel of turning thirty, while he, being a few years older, was soon to turn thirty-four. After finishing college four years ago, I‚Äôd decided to move back to my hometown, pining for the sound of the seagulls and lobster boats over even all the excitement and fun that Boston had to offer. To my surprise, when I stopped into the *Vintage Room* for a drink, I‚Äôd found him sitting at the bar, nursing a glass of whiskey. After embracing each other, and over a few more drinks, I‚Äôd found he‚Äôd decided to stay, taking a job as a deckhand on his uncle‚Äôs lobster boat.


  
That‚Äôs where the topic of paddleboard fishing had come up.


  
It was a hobby he‚Äôd taken up after being introduced to it by a tourist who‚Äôd passed through some years prior, one he‚Äôd taken a shine to. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of the most fun times I‚Äôve ever had on the water‚Äù, he‚Äôd said, ‚ÄúSeriously, you‚Äôve got to try it. Just once, and you‚Äôll catch the bug like I did‚Äù And he‚Äôd been dead on the money. Even having to learn to maintain my balance and don a wetsuit to keep from freezing during the colder months, it was a blast. More than that, it was like the old days of the two of us fishing together; the only difference was trading in the small, two person rowboat for the boards. And especially during the summer months, when both of us caught equal amounts of stripers, mackerel and bluefish, it became a thrilling friendly rivalry to see who would come out on top.


  
*The winter and spring months, though‚Ä¶not as exciting, anymore*.


  
I shook my head to push away the intrusive, almost jealous emotions which had settled over me like a storm cloud. *Knock it off, Per. Don‚Äôt let the ugly green monster ruin the fun. Just do as you always do, and shrug it off. Besides, we‚Äôve still got half an hour for you to catch something*. The mental encouragement seemed to bolster me, and I felt a genuine smile split the sourpuss face that had been plastered there. Lifting my head, I gazed out to sea as a set of large waves lifted me on their crests. Far out in the distance, just visible on the horizon, I could see the vague shapes of North Haven and Vinalhaven Island. Both seemed to rise ever so slightly from the water, like the backs of sea monsters which sailors once told tales of. The thought reminded me of the tales my grandfather had told me before he‚Äôd passed. Tales about the Sea Serpent of Mount Desert Island, of Cassie the Casco Bay Sea Monster and others I‚Äôd long forgotten the names of. ‚ÄúPerry, my boy, remember that there will always be more things undiscovered on this planet then will ever be written about in books‚Äù he‚Äôd told me.


  
As much as I agreed with his sentiments, I didn‚Äôt exactly believe in sea monsters. I was convinced that things that gargantuan wouldn‚Äôt be able to escape the prying, curious eyes of man forever. Especially with our continued exploration of the sea. Hell, it was what I had gone to college for, achieving a degree in marine biology.


  
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it!‚Äù


  
Kevin‚Äôs cry caused me to turn half-around on my board, pulling my eyes from the open ocean. He was kneeling down, holding the rod in one hand and a small landing hook in the other as his eyes focused on something beneath the surface he couldn‚Äôt see. A moment later, he dipped the hook into the water, and stood up, grinning like a kid on Christmas morning as he held up the large Striper which flopped from the end of it. ‚ÄúNow *that‚Äôs* what I‚Äôm talking about, man!‚Äù he declared triumphantly, before depositing the fish into the bucket on the board in front of him. I couldn‚Äôt help but smile and let out a chuckle at his infectious excitement. ‚ÄúNice one, bro!‚Äù I called to him, giving him a thumbs up. His smile grew wider for a moment, and then he gestured at me. ‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt gotten a bit yet?‚Äù I shook my head. ‚ÄúEither hooking your catch caused the rest to scatter away, or it was just a loner. Because there is absolutely nothing else down there biting!‚Äù


  
A thoughtful look spread across his face, and he rubbed his chin, looking around. ‚ÄúWell, how about we move a little further up the coast. There‚Äôs always bites closer to Seven Hundred Acre Island, and I‚Äôd like both of us to go home with something to show for it!‚Äù Whatever trace of envy I‚Äôd felt melted away like snow in spring at his words, replaced by appreciation for my friend‚Äôs consideration. *And that shows you exactly why he‚Äôs always been the better man of the two of us*. ‚ÄúYeah, why not?‚Äù I replied, beginning to reel in my line, ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt be any worse than here, anyways. You wanna move closer into shore, or just head straight up?‚Äù


  
Kevin didn‚Äôt answer. After waiting for a moment for a response, and as my jig breached the surface, I turned to see why he hadn‚Äôt replied. To my surprise, I found his gaze not on me, but beyond, further out to sea. His eyes were narrowed, indicating he was squinting as he raised a hand to shield his eyes from the sun which strained to shine through the clouds overhead. I felt a wave of confusion wash over me, and quickly hooked my jig onto my rod, setting it down in its holder and turned to follow his gaze. For a few moments, my eyes scanned the waves, unable to locate what had caught his attention.


  
Then, I finally saw it.


  
At first, it was just a small splash, something barely perceptible among the rest of the ever-moving ocean. Then, a small flash of yellow caught my gaze. It appeared only for a split second, then seemed to pull under the waves. After a moment, it reappeared, a few feet ahead of its prior position. *What the hell‚Ä¶?* It reappeared a third time, and for whatever reason, I felt something uncoil itself inside me as I suddenly realized that whatever it was, it was heading in our direction. I shot a look at Kevin. ‚ÄúDude‚Ä¶what the hell is that?‚Äù I softly called out. He kept his eyes trained on the approaching sight, but slowly shook his head. ‚ÄúI honestly don‚Äôt know, Perry‚Äù he answered. But the words were barely out from his lips when I saw a look of recognition flash across his face, the confusion replaced by a look of incredulity. ‚ÄúActually, scrap that. I *do* know what that is, but‚Ä¶the *hell*?‚Äù I turned back to see that the object was less than forty feet from us now.


  
And immediately recognized it myself.


  
*A buoy*. It was the kind that lobstermen used to mark the location of their pots and identify which belonged to them. The white, plastic stick to help grab it from the water stuck straight up into the sky; the flash of yellow I‚Äôd seen had been the painted stripe which ran around the top half of the Styrofoam object. It continued to move towards us at a steady pace. *No, not entirely steady*. As it moved forward, the buoy seemed to quickly jerk back and forth from the left to right every few seconds. A large wave rolled over it, and it disappeared from view for a moment. For whatever reason, not being able to see it caused a large wave of anxiety to well up in me. My mind began to race as it sought to explain what we were seeing. *It‚Äôs clearly a lobster buoy, but there‚Äôs absolutely no way the trap should be moving, not where they‚Äôre weighted down with large bricks and metal. Even moreso, the tide is going out, not in. It would be going out to sea, regardless. The only way that it could be moving in this manner is if something got caught on it, and the only thing big enough around here to drag a pot is a-*


  
‚Äú‚Ä¶Shark‚Äù I breathed. Every fiber of muscle and sinew in my body suddenly tensed up as the answer kept repeating in my mind. I slowly turned to look at Kevin. ‚ÄúDude, whatever you do, try and stay as still as possible. Try not to make noise that will draw attention to you, because I think a Great White got caught on a trap and is pulling it along behind it‚Äù Even from a distance, I caught sight of his face paling slightly. ‚ÄúOh, good God‚Äù I heard him mutter weakly. I didn‚Äôt blame him one bit for it. *Great Whites are some of the most powerful sharks that roam the oceans, ambush predators. Their bites are thousands of pounds per square inch, and they can easily bite a man in half. This one was likely attracted by the struggling of this fish on Kevin‚Äôs line, and it‚Äôs moved in to investigate. And we‚Äôre standing here on two friggin‚Äô paddleboards. We‚Äôre sitting ducks.*


  
Small wisps of fear began to seep into me as I attempted to stay as still as a statue, bracing my legs with each roll of the waves as I watched the buoy continue to approach us. I kept myself from looking down into the ocean, half expecting if I did to catch a split second glimpse of the torpedo shaped body rocketing up at me, jaws agape. My eyes tracked every jerk as it drew even with us. It was close enough that I could‚Äôve reached out and touched it. I forced my eyes to look down, seeing that the buoy must‚Äôve been in the water a long time. Below the water line, most of it was covered with a thick coating of algae and seaweed, strands of it dangling out behind it like party streamers. More covered the rope which connected the buoy to the trap below, which disappeared out of sight after about seven feet underwater. I gave a silent prayer. *Please, keep moving. For the love of God and all the angels, don‚Äôt stop; just keep moving away.*


  
A massive sense of relief suddenly surged through me as I saw they were answered. The buoy continued on its journey, passing by first myself, then Kevin. We both slowly turned to watch it move towards shore and Camden harbor, staring after it until it again disappeared from sight among the waves. I realized I‚Äôd been holding in my breath, and feeling relatively safe again, let it out in a loud *whoosh* as I bent over slightly and put my hands on my knees. Feeling the color returning to my face, I spared a look over at Kevin. He looked back at me, and for a moment, all we did was stare at each other. I was the one who began to softly chuckle at first. He joined in after a second, and moments later, the two of us were unable to stop laughing as the tension drained from us. ‚ÄúHoly‚Ä¶freaking‚Ä¶crap, Perry‚Äù he said, wiping a visible sheen of sweat from his brow, ‚ÄúThat was, and I‚Äôm not even joking, one of the creepiest fucking things to ever happen to me, period, full stop‚Äù I let out a soft cough as the laughter began to die away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling *me*? I‚Äôve studied ocean life my entire life, and even knowing what that must‚Äôve been, it still got under my skin. Makes you realize just how insignificant and vulnerable we are away from dry land, huh?‚Äù I saw him crack a slightly nervous smile. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶*one* way to phrase it‚Äù


  
He turned to look after where the buoy had disappeared, before turning back to me. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶now what should we do? Head straight back for shore, or stay out and finish fishing?‚Äù I bit my lower lip gently as I thought; his very question had been one which had begun resonating inside my head. After a time, I answered. ‚ÄúHonestly, dude, I‚Äôd say stay out, at least for a little bit. Even though part of me is screaming to get to shore, it‚Äôs the same direction that‚Ä¶*it* went‚Äù I pointed towards the harbor for emphasis before finishing. ‚ÄúSo, we should give it enough time to move on, otherwise we risk running straight into it‚Äù Realization flashed in his eyes, and he nodded as my words registered. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a good point there, my friend‚Äù he said, before giving me a genuine smile. ‚ÄúGood thing you went to school for what you did; I would‚Äôve been the dumbass to just head straight back‚Äù He hooked a thumb behind him, in the direction he‚Äôd suggested we‚Äôd go. ‚ÄúSo, you wanna use the time to try and get yourself a fish before we get our asses back to the safety of dry land?‚Äù The thought of bringing a striper or bluefish back for Mom and Dad to grill for dinner surged forward in my mind, pushing the last wisps of fear away. ‚ÄúHell yeah, man. Let‚Äôs do it!‚Äù


  
With that, I reached down, picking up the paddle and positioning myself, seeing Kevin do the same. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs go!‚Äù


  
I will forever blame myself for not having us head straight for shore.


  
It took us about twenty minutes to reach our new spot, and after dropping our lines in the water, and to my surprise, we started hooking fish after fish. The elation that surged through my heart and mind with the first bite and bend of the rod caused me to forget all about the nerve-wracking experience we‚Äôd had, and soon, the two of us were whooping and hollering as we hauled up stripers and mackerel galore. ‚ÄúTold you this would be a good spot!‚Äù Kevin called to me. I shot him a grin back. ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt lying, bro! This is the best fishing we‚Äôve had all spring, and one of the first times I‚Äôve hooked *anything* outside of summer and fall‚Äù He snorted as he dropped his line back in the water. ‚ÄúDoes that mean the green shade of envy you‚Äôve been covered with is lifting?‚Äù I jerked my head up, feeling a stab of shock crash into me at his words. ‚ÄúHow the hell did you-‚ÄúI began, but he cut me off, laughing loudly. ‚ÄúDude, we‚Äôve known each other our entire lives; give me a *little* credit in knowing you!‚Äù


  
For a moment, I continued staring at him, my mouth hanging slightly open. Then I did the only thing I could think to do: I laughed as well. *He‚Äôs not wrong*. Shaking my head, I turned to jerk my rod up and down slightly, trying to tempt another fish to take the bait. Even though my catch bucket was rather full, I still hoped I‚Äôd get one more to finish the day. But nothing seemed to be biting anymore. *It‚Äôs almost like all the fish realized we were here and fled*. I began to chuckle to myself, when a second thought followed close behind.


  
*Or because something bigger is around.*


  
Instantly, the chuckle died away, and the mental image of the buoy swam forward in my mind. Trying not to catch Kevin‚Äôs attention, I spared a look around at the choppy water, straining my eyes for any hint of color. But nothing showed itself besides the whitecaps. Still, the uncomfortable, tense wisps of anxiety began to rise back inside of me, as hard as I attempted to push it away. I mentally began to chide myself. *Cut it out, Perry. It‚Äôs long gone, whether it was a shark or whatever. It obviously wasn‚Äôt interested in you two, as it didn‚Äôt stop. Stop letting Jaws and other ocean horror movies take over your imagination. This is real life, after all.*


  
I nodded before glancing at the watch on my wrist. 4:30. I called over my shoulder. ‚ÄúHey, Kev, it‚Äôs getting a bit late. We should start heading back!‚Äù The sound of his voice drifted back to me. ‚ÄúAlright, just give me a few more minutes. I want to try and catch one more fish, but it‚Äôs like they all vanished into thin air‚Äù He chuckled. ‚ÄúOr thin water, to be more appropriate‚Äù Despite the feelings I continued to battle inside myself, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh at his lame joke. ‚ÄúFine, but just five minutes more, and then I‚Äôm towing you back if I have to‚Äù I looked over my shoulder to see him give me a mock salute with his free hand. ‚ÄúSir, yes sir!‚Äù he barked in a caricature of his drill instructor father. I smirked and shot him the bird, before turning back. Even still, I kept shooting glances at my watch, willing for the seconds hand to spin faster. Finally, after what seemed like a damned eternity, I saw that five minutes had passed.


  
I turned around. ‚ÄúHey, Kev?‚Äù I called out. I saw him lift his eyes from his line to look up at me. Vaguely, I heard him call back. But his words seemed to be drifting away as though a thick fog bank were separating us. It felt as though my scope of vision were narrowing to a small cone as my gaze moved past him, back in the direction of the harbor.


  
Where a flash of bright yellow had appeared for a split second above the waves.


  
I heard Kevin attempt to call back to me, but my gaze remained on the spot about forty yards away. I started to fight against myself. *Dude. STOP scaring yourself. There‚Äôs nothing there. You didn‚Äôt see an*\- Whatever mental chiding I had intended to use next deleted itself as the flash of color came again. And this time, I *knew* it hadn‚Äôt been a trick of my mind. It was confirmed as I saw the white stick emerge back into the air as the buoy moved through a trough in the waves. My blood suddenly ran cold as I forced the single word out from between my lips.


  
‚Äú*Fuck*‚Ä¶‚Äù


  
In my peripheral vision, I saw Kevin turn to follow my gaze, then freeze as he caught sight of the object moving towards us at a far faster clip than it had our first encounter. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶fuck me sideways‚Äù he breathed. He turned back to me. ‚ÄúStay as still as we did last time, Perry. Like you said to me, don‚Äôt draw attention to yourself. It‚Äôll lose interest and move on‚Äù The man‚Äôs words snapped me out of the stupor I‚Äôd fallen in, and I blinked my eyes rapidly, before shooting the man an appreciative nod and shifting my gaze back to the buoy. It rapidly closed the distance, before moving out to the side, about twenty feet from Kevin‚Äôs board. It stayed in place there for a moment, the jerking motion stopping and the buoy simply standing up straight in the water. Despite the anxiety and small swell of fear coursing through my veins, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a wave of confusion wash over me like the waves around us. *That‚Äôs‚Ä¶what the hell‚Ä¶how is that possible? Great Whites and most other mackerel sharks cannot stop swimming and hover; they‚Äôd asphyxiate and die otherwise. So how is it able to just stay still there like that?*


  
As I fought to comprehend what I was seeing, the buoy began to move again. It resumed its rapid, jerky journey, moving around Kevin. I turned, seeing my friend slowly set down his fishing rod next to his feet as he continued to eye the shape. Both our eyes watched the buoy as it moved around to sit in front of me, roughly the same distance it had from him. After a second, it moved back around to him, then back to me. My mind suddenly cleared, all the raging thoughts fleeing like the fish had as a single, horrific realization entered it.


  
*It‚Äôs circling us*.


  
Recognizing the predatory behavior caused a cascade of shivers to shoot up my spine as it moved around us again. I looked at Kevin, seeing a look of fear finally break his forced calm demeanor. ‚ÄúDude, what the hell do we do?‚Äù he asked, his voice weak. I slowly shook my head, moving my gaze back to the buoy. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know man, but something really isn‚Äôt right here‚Äù Before he had a chance to reply, I suddenly felt the board under my shift, almost violently. It felt as though the board had been pushed up from below by a sudden, immense change in water pressure, and I struggled to not fall headfirst into the ocean. As I regained my footing, the scientific section of my mind presented the simple, but terrifying answer to the inner argument I‚Äôd had with myself a moment ago. I felt my breathing become to come in short, ragged gasps as I tried to push it away. But, with all the evidence I‚Äôd seen, and the huge water surge that I‚Äôd just felt; too large to come from even the biggest Great White, there was no alternative. ‚ÄúK-Kevin?‚Äù I saw him turn towards me. ‚ÄúWhat is it, Per?‚Äù he asked, his voice shaking slightly. I looked up at him, seeing his face pale further at the expression on my face before I answered.


  
‚ÄúWhatever‚Äôs on the other end of this buoy‚Ä¶it‚Äôs *not* a shark‚Äù


  
For a moment, his face remained the same. Then, my words slammed into him with all the weight of a tractor-trailer. I saw his eyes go wide, as his face turned the color of a sheet. He forced himself to speak. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶oh, shit‚Ä¶‚Äù My mind raced as I attempted to come up with a plan that might do anything to help us get back to shore alive. But before I had a second to think of anything, a second surge of water rushed up from below, moving sideways and out. Shooting a glance behind me, I saw the buoy moving towards me. Then a great tug came from next to my foot. Feeling my heart enter my throat, I shot my gaze down, just in time to see my fishing rod be yanked into the water. I couldn‚Äôt even track its descent into the depths; one moment it was just below the surface, the next, it was gone, out of sight. A new realization slammed into me. *It grabbed my umbrella jig. It grabbed it and kept moving off towards-* Vaguely, I suddenly became aware that the buoy had hit the back of my paddleboard, swinging it slightly to the side. But, the largest wave of horror filled me as my thought finished, realizing where it was heading. I jerked my head up, my eyes wide as I opened my mouth to scream a warning.


  
But I was too late.


  
What happened next happened in a matter of seconds. I saw that he‚Äôd seen my fishing rod yanked into the deep, his eyes widening more than I thought a human being‚Äôs could. Then his gaze flashed down to the rod at his feet. Where a small stretch of loose fishing line had accidently curled around his leg. His eyes snapped up again to lock on mine, and for a microsecond, it felt as though the entire world had been paused. I saw every small detail with crystal clarity. I saw the sheet of sweat covering his face. I saw his lower lip begin to tremble, and a shocked, pleading look enter his eyes. He began to reach out towards me; his lips begin to form a word. One I never learned, and which keeps me awake late at night, wondering.


  
The next, he was gone.


  
I caught a glimpse of the line tightening around his leg, enough that I swear I saw it cut through the neoprene wetsuit and begin to draw blood. Then, the man standing twenty feet away from me; my oldest and most cherished friend, was yanked off his board and beneath the waves. A large stream of bubbles broke the surface for a moment. Then, nothing. The surface resumed its unending rise and fall. For my part, I didn‚Äôt move. I *couldn‚Äôt*. I felt rooted in place as my mind fought against what I‚Äôd just seen. I prayed with every ounce of faith in my soul that I would see his head break the surface as I saw the buoy continue to move away from me, before lazily turning, and after a single, massive jerk forward, hover still in the waves.


  
But he never appeared.


  
I suddenly felt the weight of the situation slam home, felt hot tears begin to stream from my eyes as I fought to keep from collapsing on my knees. I shook violently as I tried to push away the horrific mental images my mind was presenting itself. Then, they all vanished as I saw the buoy begin to resume its slow circle. Now, of just me. I continued to shake, but forced myself to stop crying, trying to keep any semblance of despair away. I knew if I allowed that emotion to overtake me, I would stay frozen in place until‚Ä¶it tired of its circling and came for me. *Think, Perry, think!*, I screamed in my head, *use all the knowledge you have of oceanic creatures in your mind. It‚Äôs a predator, so what do all predators want? Food. You don‚Äôt want to become a prey item for it, so think of an alternative. Something to divert its attention long enough for you to get away.*


  
My mind suddenly connected a dot, and I forced my eyes away from the literal circling symbol of death, to stare down at my feet. More importantly, at the bucket of fish, where a few still weakly wiggled. *Yes! If you throw the fish far enough away, it may catch its attention enough for you to get to shore*. A second thought joined the first. *But, if this thing is truly the size I think it is, one single bucket of fish won‚Äôt be enough to keep its attention long enough*. My eyes rose from my own bucket, to stare across the small stretch of water at the empty paddleboard which had belonged to Kevin. His paddle had slipped into the water, bobbing by its side. But I felt my heart soar as I saw his bucket of fish had stayed in place, though it now was precariously close to the edge. I looked up to find the buoy. It was still circling me. I felt a new surge of terror race through my veins as I realized that the circle had gotten smaller since I‚Äôd last watched it. My time was running out.

 
  
Slowly, trying to keep my movements as stable and uninteresting as I could, I reached down and picked up the paddle from where it lay. I was terrified that the second I dipped it into the water, the buoy would immediately charge towards me, signifying my final moments. But I had no alternative. *You only have one chance to do this, Perry. Don‚Äôt fuck it up*.


  
Still shaking, I began to paddle.


  
The twenty feet to Kevin‚Äôs board felt more like a mile. Every time I dipped the paddle into the water, I jerked up to watch the buoy. To my relief, it simply continued to circle. A few excruciating seconds later, I drew up next to the other board. Holding the paddle in one hand, I kneeled down and gripped onto the other. The plan was set in my mind. I let out a final prayer. *God, please let this work*. Then I picked up my own bucket of fish, before using the paddle to push Kevin‚Äôs board away from me, out towards the open ocean. The tide caught it, and it drew away from me. From the corner of my vision, I saw the buoy change course, moving towards it. And away from me. I stood up straight, staying still. *Wait for it. Wait until it‚Äôs far enough away*. The empty board drifted another twenty feet away. I drew all the strength I had remaining in me into my arm, cocking it back as I readied to make a throw which would make the major leagues impressed. It moved another ten feet away, the buoy continuing to slowly follow it.


  
*NOW!*


  
As soon as the bucket left my grasp, I turned and began driving the paddle into the water as quietly and calmly as my shaking hands would allow. Behind me, I heard a dull *thunk* as the plastic bucket slammed into the water. I wasn‚Äôt sure how true my aim had been, but I refused to turn and look. I kept paddling, moving it from one side of the board to the other to keep it straight. I heard the cries of the gulls behind me begin to increase, signifying they must‚Äôve starting dive bombing the mass of fish that had fallen into the ocean.


  
And then, I heard it.


  
I never turned to look at it. Even if I‚Äôd *wanted* to, I was far too terrified to do so. But I heard the huge eruption of water emanate from somewhere behind me. It was followed by the largest splash I‚Äôve ever heard in my life. Even though I was far off, I felt small droplets of water fall onto my head and neck. My mind screamed at me that it had to be gargantuan in order to cause a splash giant enough to reach me. Even still, I continued to paddle towards shore, watching the land grow larger and larger in my gaze.


  
That horrifying day was almost a month ago now.
  
For the rest of my life, I will never understand how I managed to get away. Such a giant beast must‚Äôve finished with those small fish in seconds. The only conclusion I can come to, is one that turns my blood to ice. That it wasn‚Äôt interested enough to pursue me.


  
Because‚Ä¶it‚Äôd *already* fed.


  
When I‚Äôd made it to shore, emerging from the surf by *The Inn at Ocean‚Äôs Edge*, I must‚Äôve looked like a madmen to those staying there. Tumbling off my paddleboard and dashing forward, screaming about my friend being dragged under and killed by a sea monster. My mind was fried from the adrenaline and horror that had consumed it. The police were, of course called. When they asked for my statement, as much as I knew they wouldn‚Äôt believe me, I still told the truth. They needed to know. Kevin deserved to have the truth told.


  
And I was right. They didn‚Äôt.


  
Not entirely, anyways. They *did* believe that the two of us had been attacked by something, more than likely a shark, as I‚Äôd originally thought it was. They sent the Coast Guard out to search the area. But they never found a trace of my friend. Or his board, for that matter. All they found was a few floating dead fish. He was declared a victim of a shark attack and lost at sea.

 
  
No one blamed me for his death. But I‚Äôve seen them look at me oddly. I‚Äôve seen them whispering to each other when I go to the *Vintage Room*, to try and drink myself into enough of an intoxicated stupor that I won‚Äôt dream. No doubt I must now look like the crazy man in the town to them, ranting and raving about things that don‚Äôt exist.


  
But I know the truth. They *do* exist.


  
All the stories I heard my grandfather tell me. Of the Serpent of Mt. Desert Island. Of Cassie the Casco Bay Monster. And of those told around the world for centuries. They‚Äôve been true. Science tried explaining them away, saying that they were misidentification or superstitious wise tales. But the truth is, we‚Äôve barely begun exploring the oceans. And there‚Äôs so much of it, that it can hide things.


  
Fearsome and monstrous things.


  
I can‚Äôt bring myself to go close to the water still without wanting to burst into fits of screams. I don‚Äôt know if I will *ever* be able to. Not without recalling the nightmares I‚Äôve had every single night since that day; ones that no amount of alcohol can chase away. Nightmares of my friend flailing in the dark, suffocating embrace of the ocean, as something rushes towards him from the dark, it‚Äôs razor-sharp toothed maw gaping open to devour him.
  


I know none of you will believe me. And frankly, I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm posting this, because I hope that it might help make living with the memories even just a little bit easier to bear. 
  


And to warn you.
  


I don‚Äôt know how many sea serpents and monsters prowl the ocean‚Äôs depths around the world. But, I *do* know that there‚Äôs at least one that lives along the Maine coast. So, please, heed my warning. Even if you don‚Äôt believe me, keep an eye out for a yellow and white lobster buoy moving through the water, through the waves.
  


And if you ever do see it, whether you‚Äôre on a boat, or a paddleboard.
  


For the love of *God*, get to shore.

582,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colocasia/comments/1c1yc9x/can_colocasias_make_good_houseplants/,Can colocasias make good houseplants?,"Hi everyone, I've heard a lot of people say that colocasias are super difficult or impossible to grow indoors, but I don't agree. It's just hard to find detailed or good information about how to care for them indoors, particularly in northern climates, which is pretty discouraging for people who don't have any outdoor space. So I thought I'd share my experiences with the different varieties and growing methods that I've tried over the last 3-ish years. Hopefully some people will find it helpful.

For reference here are my growing conditions:

Lighting: natural light only from large East windows. About 6-7hrs of direct sun in the summer, down to maybe 1hr per week in the dead of winter. Daylength here varies from 8-16hrs.

Humidity: usually 50%-ish

Temperature: 19-24¬∞c

Altitude: 200m

Water: ph7.5, very low levels of minerals

Nutrients: FoliagePro at a rate of ¬º to 1/2tsp/G at every watering, sometimes with kelp extract added, for both soil and hydroponics. I've also used other synthetic and organic fertilizers which worked fine as well.

# Varieties that I've owned (ranked from what I consider the best/easiest to most difficult):

Diamond Head:

This is the variety I have grown continually (no dormancy) for the longest time. It keeps growing through the winter, just with smaller leaves, and it's fun to see the leaf colour change from green to a deep mahogany in the summer. Mine has maxxed out at about 3 feet tall. It blooms a lot in the summer and the flowers smell nice, a bit like pineapple or papaya. Has done well in soil and hydroponics. The leaf tips sometimes tend to brown a bit in winter, maybe due to me keeping it a bit too wet in the winter or because it's beside the heater.

Big Dipper (proven winners labelled it ‚ÄúCoffee Cups‚Äù but I don't believe them):

Also a good year-round grower. It takes up little space due to the upright growth habit. It likes to send out metres-long runners which can be annoying but they're easy to cut off.

Illustris aka Imperial Taro aka colocasia antiquorum:

A shorter variety with proportionally large leaves. Constantly sends out runners. Seems to do well with less light than other varieties. This is the only colocasia that doesn't seem to guttate, as far as I have noticed. The flowers have a mild wet dog smell, but it isn't too bad. The leaves tended to brown a bit around the edges which seemed odd as I had it in hydroponics, maybe soil would work better. Sadly, mine contracted what I am pretty sure was tobacco mosaic virus from coming in contact with tobacco, so I don't have it anymore.

Coal miner:

It stays fairly small for me. Leaves can be purple with green veins in lower light or a dark smoky grey in higher light. Extremely sensitive to underwater ing, I literally had one crisp up in a few hours when the water reservoir ran dry. Hydroponics and soil both worked well. The flowers smell nice but not quite as good as Diamond Head's.

Blue Hawaii:

The flowers smell nice, similar to Diamond Head. Unfortunately mine never got as colourful as they do outdoors, even in the height of summer. It did however grow to monstrous proportions in a few months and damaged the floor by guttating so much there were puddles around it every morning.

C. Esculenta (the common green variety):

Very similar in growth to blue hawaii

Black Magic:

The edges of the leaves tended to brown a lot.

Heart of the Jungle, Fontanessii:

I think they would have done ok if I had more light. But for me they grew extremely tall leggy. 

# Growing mediums:

Hydroponic (LECA in a net pot suspended over a reservoir of water; similar to Kratky method):

This seems to be the best medium in terms of speed and quality of growth. However they quickly fill up the net Pot with corms and offshoots, and its not really possible to up-pot due to the massive, tangled root systems. I only increased the size of the water reservoir. I only kept them in Hydro for up to 8 months so I don't know if it could work long-term.

A container of water (with nutrients added) :

I think this is the best method if you don't want your colo to get too large. It's also very easy, I just changed the water maybe once a month and topped it up as needed in between. I put kelp extract in the water to darken it to prevent algae. I kept the corm fully submerged and it was easy to remove the old leaves because they would rot off at the base. The only issue is it can be tricky to keep the plant propped up if the roots have not yet filled the container.

Potting mix (semi-submerged in water):

Keeping the soil saturated results in fast growth, but the leaf margins can sometimes brown, possible due to a combination of guttation and lack of airflow.

Potting mix (watered twice daily to every three days):

Slightly slower but reliable growth. Minimal guttation.

# Problems/troubleshooting:

Insects: colocasias in garden centres are often outdoors and have spidermites, so I always wash them off and quarantine for a few days before adding them to my collection. If they have signs of thrips I don't buy since they're hard to eradicate. No pest issues so far (knock on wood)

Disease: at one point I brought home a new colocasia which quickly developed leaf spots which almost instantly spread to every matte-leaf variety I had, with the exception of Illustris. I've never seen this on outdoor colocasias or heard of anyone else having this experience so I have no idea what causes it. At least Diamond Head and Illustris seem to be resistant, and it didn't affect my other houseplant species.

Leaves getting stuck/not emerging from the sheaths: I've only had this happen in winter, when I also wasn't fertilizing as much as usual. So I guess it was caused by either lack of light or nutrients or both.

Mold: sometimes the soil gets moldy, this can be resolved by top-dressing  with a layer of pea gravel.

Sprawling: I like to use a tomato cage or hoop structure if their getting too wide for my space.



So all things considered I think they can make great, entertaining houseplants and I don't get why they aren't more popular. What do you guys think? Anyone had similar or different experiences?",11 Apr 2024 22:53:12,reddit

One was both broad and wide, another frail in comparison and a third so pale it gave Elena a run for her money. Two other seemed roughly equal in height and width to Vladislav though one; hiding what seemed to a bald head under his cap, had rather sunken cheeks, fit for a drug addict.

 Elena glanced at Vladislav who stared uncaring out the windshield for a moment before he parked the car, got out and went to the trunk. she had searing questions on her mind, yet they did not manifest themselves on her lips as she had hoped. Instead she unbuckled her seatbelt and got out of the passenger seat, eager to see what Vladislav was shuffling through his trunk for.  The harsh breeze blowing from the Green Sea cut through her coat, making her teeth chatter as the chill air seeped into her skin and made a mess of her long hair. 

She glanced at Vladislav's group of friends again, all wearing working and hunting  clothes, camouflage or dirty aviator jackets. A bunch of blue-collar kids, that much was true. Elena moved to be behind Vladislav, watching him grap what seemed like a metal pipe from the large canvas bag, she had noted he kept in his trunk. With a shake of his hand, the sack came loose around the object, revealing an assault rifle. 

Elena nearly jumped but caught herself, taking a step back. She turned her gaze to the others who too were going through the trunks of the Golf and Lada it seemed they had arrived in, brandishing weapons of their own. Most of them seemed to be from the time of the Great Patriotic War though Elena was no expert in guns.

 ""V-Vlad...w-what's all of this for?"" She stammered, taking another step backwards. Vladislav looked at her relaxed while he loaded the weapon. ""Some of the Russian guys up in Olsha are getting a little too big for their britches""  Vladislav said and hummed, pulling back on a lever on the right side of the assault rifle

 ""Are you going to kill them?"" Elena cried, both of her hands reaching up to cover her mouth.  Vladislav turned, tugging down his beanie indifferently. ""Elena...no. Of course we aren't going to kill anyone. We're just going to go up there and have a chat about...catcalling the girls from the other side. We don't take kindly to that, you see"" 

Elena's throat bobbed as he said that. Last time she had heard the word 'catcalling', it'd come out of Vladislav's mouth too, at the party. When he was beating up a guy for catcalling and getting touchy with Elena. That guy, whose nose Vladislav had broken, had one week later thrust a screwdriver into Vladislav's side and narrowly missed his liver.  

SCENE TWO 

Vladislav was already waiting for her as she stepped off the morning bus. His white Lada sat in the middle of the school parking lot as it did every morning when he had driven from his home oblast. After feeding and milking sixty-five cows. The windows were foggy to put it the very least. Elena‚Äôs brow furrowed as she stepped closer to the fogged windows. She attempted to see through the obstructed glass in the driver‚Äôs side but couldn‚Äôt see nothing. Oh, then she might as well pull the door handle.

 She gripped the door handle, pulling with all her might. Just like so many other Ladas she had seen, his  had begun rusting away at the edges of the roof, doors and trunk. A bit of algae had begun growing on the rubber moulding holding the windshield in place. 

The door croaked open, revealing a snoring Vladislav laying on his side. He was wrapped in the rough gray woolen blanket she had seen before, but this time wearing a new jacket. If one could call it that. It was in fact a military uniform with a thick fur collar, like the ones she remembered the soldiers wearing when her parents watched the news about the war in Afghanistan against the Mudjahadin years ago. He had probably gotten it from a soldier in need of money or from a surplus store, likely without paying. 

His jeans were a different story all together. Though not visibly worn at first, one could clearly the patches his mother had sewn on the inside to hide the fact it wasn‚Äôt denim fabric.  The interior of his car was an equal mess. On the dash sat a half eaten piece of Buterbrod with pickles and a big slice of kolbasa. The cassette player also sat on the dash, scewed directly into it with a uncovered piece of wire running down into the radio.  Beside Vladislav lay his tumbler, beads of condensation water running down the metal. 

On the passenger seat sat a bottle of vodka although to Elena‚Äôs satisfaction he had only taken a small amount to spike his tea. Though she had a feeling his trunk was filled to the brim with old plastic containers filled with to the brim with homemade vodka. He'd sell it out of his trunk after school, she had figured out that much. 

His book bag lay on the backseat together with three or more  tractor manuals, and a mix of nails, bolts and nuts. Despite the half dozen air fresheners that hung from the windshield mirror, the car stank heavily of livestock. Drool dripped from the corner of Vladislav's mouth, pooling in one of the backseat seat wells. Elena scoffed, he shouldn't be expecting a good morning kiss from her. 

The three weeks she had been dating this to put it frankly, peculiar dirt poor son of an electrician and a nurse, had been quite a ride. Well, that waswhen she compared it to her somewhat comfortable life in Miroslavl now and the bit of money her parents had scraped together with their former positions as low level officials of the bygone Communist Party; back when the Soviet Union had yet to collapse and Chernarus was yet to become an indepedent country. While they lived in Novigrad. Well, they had lived there until seven weeks ago.

This is going to be LONG as I get pretty in depth and into writing I apologize if it's too long for some of you. I have more STILL to add with the creatures in Volume one.

TLDR: Fisher Callahan is a Poaching hunter searching for revenge and the protection of threatened beasts. Using a specialist ability known as **Chatterbox Anthoogy** a set of 3 books that is basically combining a pokedex for nen/ magical beasts, chrollos skill hunter, and a long range map (similar to the marauders map from HP)

**Fisher Callahan: Poacher Hunter**

Fisher Callahan is a 24-year-old Poacher hunter, born on an unnamed island far from the coast east of Jappon. Raised by his father and little brother, he was always taught that the island itself is special for being a focal point where a large quantity of animals, magical beasts, and other oddities that migrate over the skies and seas around the island. Hundreds of hundreds of different animals pass through these waters every migration season.

Fisher‚Äôs father was responsible for tracking the endangered and magical beasts passing through the island, counting the numbers and the flight or swimming quality of the groups telling if the species is in threat or healthy. His father and Fisher built an observation tower at wing peak the highest point on the island next to a Rockbill Vex nest that his father had been protecting and nurturing the juvenile birds once the mother leaves the nest, him and his father would spend a majority of Fisher‚Äôs early childhood counting winged beasts and teaching how to identify poaching boats. Also taking his son on many trips off the island to places where other animals were to learn of the vastness of this world.

Once Fisher turned 8 his father sat him down one night setting a glass full of water on the table in front of him. He told his son to feel the energy around him and move that energy towards his hands, after 2 days of practice a small glow appeared from the glass having sediment appear. His father furthered his training learning effectively control ten, ren, and zetsu by his 9th birthday. He was a long retired hunter by this point. He and his father continued their training and observation every spring through summer.

Once he turned 10, he began to see father less and less, poaching companies with a red flag and a crescent white moon had been continuously being spotted attacking the migrating wildlife but their main objective seemingly was the Rockbill Vex. He would be reunited with his father only to notice his arm was missing up past the elbow. Something changed in his father after that last trip, something important, he would take his son off the island for the last time and drop him off in the dense jungles of the Kukan‚Äôyu Kingdom and forbid him from returning home until his 13^(th) birthday. His father gave him three rules to follow: stay withing the bounds of the Kukan‚Äôyu forest, do not enter any civilizations within the borders, and do not run from a fight. These rules were seal with a promise thread.

While on Kukan‚Äôyu he learned nen entirely on his own, while also learning to be self sufficient only killing what he had to and not wasting the food he caught. He learned advanced applications of nen through observing the fights between different magical beast and a hunter who occasionally passed through these woods helping him develop his first hatsu Mischiefs Witness to aid his father in tracking beasts once home. It took him 3 years and 3 months to realize he was ready to show his father the progress he had made, so he began migrating east towards the coast. While wandering the coast he spotted one of the Rockbill Vex‚Äôs him and his father raised frantically flying toward him, looking frightened he needed Fisher to return home immediately.

The entire island was devastated; buildings on fire, reserves ransacked, along with the observation tower destroyed. No one was left, not a soul, except his father clutching the last remaining egg of the Rockbill Vex‚Äôs know to them. With his dying words his father orders him to protect this egg as it is his and fisher‚Äôs treasure. He would to protect this egg staking his life on it. This destroyed Fisher completely breaking down for 2 days, vowing revenge on those that kill his father and destroyed his home, this unlocked something in Fisher pleading and begging for something to help him or convince this is just a dream.¬† He visualized the chest he and his father kept their records in conjuring a stack of books and a locked box labeling this the Chatterbox Anthology. Becoming a specialist. 

From then on Fisher established a moral code to defend any threatened beasts hunted by poachers and to track down and destroy anyone associated to the company of poachers that killed his father. He took the hunter exam at 15 years old alongside a two year old young RockBill Vex named ""Pik"". By the time he turned 20 he had begun to build a globe spanning networks of rangers by using a hunter only website locked to poaching hunters that tracks movement patterns of wildlife and their nature reserves. Earning him a recommendation for a one-star hunter promotion.

**Chatterbox Anthology**

Nen Affinity: Specialist (Favoring conjuration, Manipulation, and Emission

Ability Description: A set of 3 books is tailored to beast hunting, combat, and surveying. It protects and stores magical beast aura in books allowing to be summoned. While also stealing nen beasts from targeted poachers permanently.

¬†

**Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir**, is a leather-bound book used to store information on magical beasts/ nen beasts using physical artifacts of the desired summon, dead or alive (e.g., a feather, claw, scale, or bone fragment).

¬†

¬†**Volume Two: Blather Book**, is a red skin-bound book with noticeable fur on the body and spine and teeth where the pages should be, used to summon any creature stored within Vol. 1 as a manipulated nen beast through a set of conditions. Each stored object is given its own corresponding symbol in Vol. 1.¬†

¬†

**Volume Three: Ebony Keep** is a sealed, indestructible cylindrical container with two compartments. One holds a larger tan rolled map (**Mischief‚Äôs Witness**), a thin metal kaleidoscope (**Oculon**), and a sack of small pins (**Lens and Ocu pins**), and the other holds items with nen currently being tracked. If a pin is placed onto something or an object containing nen is stored within the container, the target's location/ health/ and emotional state are displayed on the map.

¬†

**Conditions and Uses:**

**Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must have either an object, body part, or nen sample linked to the animal

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The sample used for binding must be of a size and shape that allows it to fit onto a page within Volume One.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Volume One can only hold information on 12 beasts at a time. If 12 beasts occupy the 12 pages already, the user must erase the knowledge of a previously stored beast if a new animal will be added.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User must inflict a wound upon themselves, allowing blood to mix with the aura of the object. This act creates a symbolic key and a binding contract between the user's nen and the beast

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must inscribe a symbol representing the stored creature using their own blood on the same page as the object.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must maintain absolute silence throughout the entire inscription process, as noise renders the contract null and void.

¬†

**Volume Two: Blather Book**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must shed blood by being bitten by the blather book in order to open it and use the summoning paper

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must inscribe the beast‚Äôs symbol onto a blank page of the book using blood from the wound. This symbol acts as a conduit through which the nen beast is summoned.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The book will absorb the user's nen proportional to the strength and complexity of the beast being summoned. (As long as the nen units are available, there is no limit to the number of beasts summoned.)

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Some creatures may require specific environmental conditions to be summoned effectively. For example, a fire-based creature may need to be summoned in a hot and dry environment.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user is bound to a state of zetsu during the summoning ritual, although partially summoned beasts can still defend or attack opponents. Partial summons are faster than full summons

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If a mutual bond between user and nen beasts is formed anytime during the beasts binding to a page in volume one, a personal contract can be created (usually a vow of protection or a set of demands).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user can add either one physical aspect of the nen beast or utilize its nen ability onto themselves when the beast is summoned. If the beast is destroyed or the nen dissipates the ability is cancelled and a hefty tax on nen is expelled proportional to the abilities usefulness, while additionally destroying 1/3 of the stored artifact/ nen inside Volume One.

¬†

**Volume Three: Ebony Keep**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Requires nen plus the pass phrase to open being ‚ÄúFind that which is hidden.‚Äù

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If a target's belongings are stored in Ebony Keep's storage box, their health, emotional state, Nen use, and location are vaguely displayed on Mischief's Witness.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Only use is to secure and hold nen emitting and primary tools in Volume three

**Volume Three: Mischief‚Äôs Witness**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Lens pins can be placed onto spots displayed on Mischief‚Äôs Witness where Ocu pins are located in order to view zoomed in areas. Uses gyo to zoom into Lens pins

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user must only open Volume Three: Mischief Witness to track and monitor targets through the Ocu pins on them or their belongings. It cannot be used for any other purpose.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Upon placing an Ocu pin on something, a permanent marker is displayed on Mischief's Witness without distance limitations from user to the pin. However, the marker's detail can‚Äôt be seen beyond 200 meters from the pin's location.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If the user intends to kill the tracked target, their own location will be revealed to the target. However, the target's location will be crystal clear to the user.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The user can only place a maximum of 24 Ocu pins at any given time and 3 Lens Pins. Placing additional pins beyond this limit will cause the oldest pin to disappear, removing its marker from Mischief's Witness without informing the user.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The map requires the user to stay in one place to use.

**Volume Three: Oculon**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Oculon's clarity is limited to 20 meters; beyond this, images become increasingly blurry and indistinct.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Clarity depends on the user's focus and visualization skills; maintaining a clear mental image enhances detail.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Physical contact on Lens pins provides a clear stationary picture of an ocu pin‚Äôs location and a projection of the user‚Äôs en

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Users must remain cautious of prolonged use of Oculon as presence can be sensed through this ability.

¬†

**Volume One‚Äôs Beast Compendium:**

**Page 1: Grishohm‚Äôs Mane ‚ÄúPlunder Fluff‚Äù (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Dried outer scuta from Royal Crest

**Location:** Numere Wetlands and certain rocky shores on coasts of the Loblolly Bay and Gorteau

**Description:** Colony type magical beast exhibiting extreme absorbative properties concerning aura. Appearance is identical to normal brown costal algae with a soft looking appearance but reality are similar in anatomy to a siphonophore. Excretes a low potency stimulant that when absorbed through skin contact manipulates inflected into a for state of ten. If Grishohm‚Äôs Mane is exposed to aura growth and duplication increases at an alarming rate compared to normal rates. Has the ability to split itself into segments or propel portions of colony up to 8 meter away. Any aura received by separated colonies have been observed to relay all aura back to original colony and received by the royal crest (the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù or the colony). Similar to a flat barnacle the queen crest can exist disconnected to the main colony and still receive aura to produce more cells.

**Uses and Summons:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Upon summoning user will receive a royal crest, this can be placed on any surface including flesh (Usual placement being the roof of the mouth), once placed use will receive a thin colony of Grishohm‚Äôs Mane covering a portion of body.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† User can freely manipulate the colony ‚Äòs location and shape through conscious orders from the royal crest

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Any contact by opponent will leave behind residual fluff, will then actively begin to spread from opponents nen output 30% of which will be siphoned back to the royal crest and absorbed by the user

**Drawbacks:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Highly ineffective against transmuters once Hatsu is initiated especially if the ability almost purely transmuter

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Absorption qualities of Plunder Fluff affect user as well so skin location where colony units are must be kept under a constant state of Zetsu or Ryu at 0% open up weak spots in defense

¬†

**Page 2: Castle Tegu (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Large scale plate from right pectoral

**Location:** West Rocky Gorges of the Kakin Empire

**Description:** 3 meter tall Bipedal capable carnivorous reptiles with the potential to learn human language gifted in hunting. The body of a Castle Tegu is covered in thick incredibly durable scale plating that also varies in color which determines the reptile‚Äôs temperament. Grey scales often act headstrong and confident, Black scales often act short-tempered and violent, Green scales often act logical and controlled, Beige often are stoic and cunning, or Yellow often are spastic and impulsive. While Tegus found bearing white stripes are capable of nen use without the evidence of Hatsu development but evidence of Ko. Pack behavioral mentality often in groups from 5 ‚Äì 20 with 1 to 2 striped Tegus among the hunting party, prefer prey regularly that puts at a power disadvantage, with prey being twice their size, speed, strength, or potential. Additionally, Castle Tegus can freely manipulate internal body temperature at will, while naturally are cold blooded, the presence of a internal blood vessel layer can significantly heat the body and blood temperature to drastic highs capable of catching fire. This is only a controllable feature in striped Tegus through aura control as these blood vessel layers reactive through the 4 principles, while non-striped still have these same properties but require outside aura to observe this feature. Moreover, a barbaric behavior seen in these creatures (striped) while injured or on the defensive have the ability to project heated blood from wounds through muscle control.

**Uses and Summons:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Upon summoning user will have a 1/3 chance to receive a striped castle tegu, reptile be summoned within 5 feet of user and will not know the context of the situation at hand upon use.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†User will typically be seen as Pack leader and able to strategies group attacks, this sentiment diminishes with pack size

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Contact with nen of any type quickly heats the skin to burning levels and is relatively harmless to Tegu

**Drawbacks:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Beast with high intelligence, unpredictability, and independence while summoned occasional disobedience and trickery. Higher the temperament, striped, or pack numbers could result in mutiny (leadership + strength are key to establish pack alpha status when summoned)

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† High nen cost for the number of units conjured

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cold sensitive

**Established Contract:** Temperature manipulation and Muscle armor available for use by user in exchange for Tegu free will while summoned and vow of protection of their habitat.

¬†

**Page 3: Enigmi Eel (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Full right secondary dorsal gyrofin

**Location:** No known habitat; Nomadic in nature and not usually in groups of no more than 2, outside of mating season. Found all over the globe high in the atmosphere.

**Description:** More commonly known as ‚Äúthe Whales of the Sky‚Äù are large flying creatures growing anywhere from 20 to 35 meters long that resemble a translucent multi-finned Unagi Eel with clear reflective scales. It is said that seeing a bright light moving in the sky that is different colors from the stars at night could be these flying beasts dancing above us and are a sign of either good luck or future chaos. Their lifespans are known but no evidence of a nest or egg mound has been located, consensus is that lifetime extends further than a century and mating occur near the end on an eel‚Äôs life birthing one to two offspring at a time. Adult bodies of Eels have one main central dorsal gyrofin, one set of two secondary side dorsal fins, one set of two smaller extender fin rays, and two large pelvic gyrofins that control a majority of the eels‚Äô flight and speed. The eels are natural emitters and manipulators having the ability to project their nen or mold it into tail like extensions to use their ability. Through sunlight reflection or oil secretion mixing into their nen gives the aura both hypnotic and disorienting qualities to aid in the beasts‚Äô relative complications to fighting physically only through forceful gusts of wind. On occasion, these eels can also cloak themselves. Something to note, the oily secretion from the skin of the eel has a highly psychoactive property the puts individuals into paralysis, if collected can be used as a non-lethal poison for kidnapping or interrogation.

**Uses and Summons:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Upon summoning the user will always receive a 35-meter Enigmi Eel at 50 meter above them which will reflect the current emotional state of the user (Happiness, determination, or anger have the most effect.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†Within a 50-to-75-meter range eels can project illusionary doubles of themselves, illusionary attacks, doubles of the user, mirages of obstacles, landmasses, or allies. Additionally, can let out bright lights or imperceivable dashes short distances away (about 8 meters).

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Intensity of attack patterns and potency of illusory nen increases in proximity of the attacker to the eel.

**Drawbacks:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† While nen beast is under control by user range and potency of illusory nen is decreased but still affects them, is worsened by the damage incurred by eel

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Less effective during storms or large overcast weather, worse during rain or in a negative mindset or depressed.

**Established Contract:** Illusionary nen available for use by user in return for a simple Vow of protection as well as establishing an area of seclusion or a safe area sky nature reserve for juvenile eels

¬†

**Page 4:** **General Toad (Nen Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** residual nen inside torn cloth

**Origin of capture:** A leader of a poaching sect seeking revenge for losing his team while trying to acquire rare pelts in the Balsa Islands

**Description:** Large 4-meter orange bull frog dressed in general fatigues and war-time armor carrying a heavy metal club. Smokes cigars and is the common stereotypical army hard-ass personality. General Toad is a remote targeting nen beast with three modes of attack: sentinel stance, assault mode, and mode: blitzkrieg, each have their own importance to defense, offense, and complete blind fury. While being an extension of the users nen, although being a stolen ability, the toad itself having its own thoughts, personality, and feelings, it recognizes that its original user no longer is its present one and treats him as such. General Toad is usually grouchy and rude to its users and enemies.

Uses and abilities:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Upon summoning the user will become the safeguard and General toad will automatically be set in Sentinel stance defense. Usually around 2 ‚Äì 3 meters away from the object labeled the safeguard although the object labeled the safeguard can be changed at will

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Sentinel Stance: General Toad maintains a set circle around the safeguard at a 5-meter radius, during which the toads‚Äô reflexes and agility are enhanced to a significant degree as long as he stays withing the outlined 5-meter circle. Benefits only valid for defensive tactics and not offensive moves, Toad cannot use the club while in sentinel stance.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Assault Mode: Once and order is given that requires the toad to leave the circle Assault mode automatically begins. Or once General Toad is made to touch the iron club assault mode initiates and an order is to attack the most dangerous threat on the battlefield. Assault mode is capable of multiple attacks including the club as well as its tongue having the ability to transform into a machine gun, a cannon, or a flamethrower.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mode: Blitzkrieg: Only useable in a situation where the toad is in a pure state of rage or when the threat of the users life is completely in danger. Murderous aura envelopes the toad and transforms changing from orange to red growing horns and thick armored plating, Toad becomes bipedal and a spike in all physical traits. General toad loses all sense of self reverting to a state of feral behavior, focuses on the most powerful attacker or the closest living being.

Drawbacks:

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Just an a-hole at times

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† If safeguard is transferred an new circle must be drawn to begin protection

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Assault mode and blitzkrieg often disregard the safety of the user or their allies, si caution must be given when used.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blitzkrieg quickly uses significant amounts of the nen used to summon the nen beast Grishohm‚Äôs Mane can be used to lengthen the duration of the summon.

¬†

**Page 5:** **Rockbill Vex ‚ÄùPik‚Äù (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Feathers from the left wing of a juvenile Vex

**Location:** Small, scattered nests burrowed in the eastern lands of Yorbia

**Description:** A blue, black, and white painted bird about 112 centimeters tall and a wingspan of 225 centimeters males are larger than females usually. Only known remaining wild member of its kind is being protected by Fisher, being raised since it was a hatchling. Species was hunted to borderline extinction over the bird‚Äôs blood having rejuvenating qualities while also being an ingredient in a illegal drugs. Rockbill Vex‚Äôs are one of the fastest flying bird‚Äôs the planet having the power to influence are currents and static electricity through the metallic point at the end of their beak giving them the ability to trigger lightning and gale-like winds. The Vex has superior eyesight through its unconscious use of gyo as he can see focused images from up to 1-2 kilometers away perfect for tracking.

**Uses and Summons:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pik is never usually stored inside Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir, as Pik is considered Fisher‚Äôs loyal companion or pet. Pik is never further than 3 kilometers from Fisher all times if so a condition will be activated where a red compass arrow appears on the left hand of Fisher after Pik goes beyond 10 Kilometers of Fisher the bird will be sent back to the book.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Pik‚Äôs aerial maneuverability is superior being able to turnaround on a dime at Mach 1+ speeds. The faster the speed the sturdier the birds‚Äô wings and beaks are.

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Combined with the increasing speeds Pik can generate ladders of lightning across the sky at will generating energy and electricity further up the sky they get.

**Drawbacks:**

-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fisher considers this beast as more than a pet and like brother could be seen as a detrimental weakness",07 Apr 2024 21:45:21,reddit

https://preview.redd.it/79gp6fuvfysc1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc7a1500ed583999b7d46e4bcd7d3cf3546cea5

I rented a house with a 10k gallon/40k liter pool, and the gardener was doing the pool service, but I found out he was just adding chlorine and pH down, and didn‚Äôt really know what he was doing, so the chlorine was really strong and the pH was so low it was off the charts and I needed to add 6 pounds of soda Ash to bring up the pH to the proper level. All was well for awhile.

Since I‚Äôve taken over, he has stopped adding the chlorine (which I had asked him to reduce), and I sort of forgot to do it during the two cold months that we have, and it started to slightly turn a blue green shade, so I realized I needed to take action.    


In total, I added pool shock (a 10lb/5kg bucket), plus algae shock, which I think is just mostly chlorine (2lbs/1Kg) and after measuring, adding, measuring, adding, the color started to improve. The first results were bright red after months of no chlorine, then slowly the bright red began to lighten, but still not to yellow.  I decided to also add cyanuric acid (2lbs/1kg).  I made my best estimates on all of these, but I‚Äôm sure they weren‚Äôt absolutely exact as I don't know the exact pool size, and the shape makes measurement impossible.  I have also been putting 90% TCCA chlorine tablets in the dispenser. It seems to be what most people are using around here, but I don‚Äôt know if it is what is ideal.

The pool color has improved, but my test results are so strange that I can‚Äôt find any search results that yield a similar situation. My pH looks a little high, and that should be easy to fix, but the chlorine result is quite confusing because it has these orange specs inside that don‚Äôt dissipate, so I don‚Äôt know if this result is even accurate, and if I should keep adding chlorine, or if I should back off.   I did the test in the morning as I read that was important.

Anyway, here is the test picture, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice, because I‚Äôve read so much, but I‚Äôm stumped by this and don't see any similar situation. I keep getting the same result, different times of day, day after day, and also testing in different areas of the pool.

Thank you!

Just kind of keeps looking more like I want it over time.  I recently rescaped the tank and tried to group the hammers, torches, and sps. It looks great under all blues, but I don't have the orange filter.  

My next step is dosing.  I was showing some coral friends this picture today, and they said it's time.  The tank size is 13.5 gallons 

Some hopes are that the algae backs down a bit.  (Gonna get more CUC.  My snails slowly died off bc I didn't know the flipping them over to live issue... Didn't think they'd actually all just die.) Also want a emerald crab.  I think I accidentally killed my last one when it was molting... Gruesome.  

Id like to eventually glue some rocks to make a more unique scape.  Right now I just Jenga them all together.  Wanted two main structures with a canyon through the middle. 

Id like another torch on the left.  Black tentacles with neon green tip would be ideal.  

And I hope the dosing keeps the sps happy and growing.  ",06 Apr 2024 14:55:19,reddit

598,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bvaffs,SUBNAUTICA PHYLOGENETIC TREE (ENTIRE),"I would like to make an essay here to clarify everything

First off, I made the clades based off of  Earth phylogeny (if it wasn't already obvious), wich means that some parts of it may not be correct, but it's the way I saw having more sense. Second, is that I have some doubts with certain creature locations (Skyray, Mesmer, Eye Jelly and Hivemind), but that doesn't really matter. Anyway, let me explain:

*Fauna*: The first chart of this I made like in late 2022, if I'm not mistaken, and it's by far the part I made most changes. I remember a clade called ""Raya"" existing and me putting everything that didn't look like a vertebrate or an arthropod into cnidaria, back in the days, so...

The most basal of the metazoans here is the Amoeboid (obvious, even the PDA specifies), beind sort of a mixture between a comb jelly and a sponge. Later, derived the lineage that gave origin to the Crescent Moon Coral. Dispite it's name refering to it as a coral, it's PDA entry says that it's eating behaviour is more similar to that of a Sponge, with cells specialized with flagellum in the inner-basket parts being responsible for capturing nutrients in the water. Whatever the case really is, these creatures seem more like poriferans than to any cnidarian. 

After the 2 more basal lineages, there is a split between the bilaterians and non-bilaterians. Looking first into the non-bilaterians we have Cnidaria and the Hivemind (there were no other places to put the Hivemind unless this specific one). Into Cnidaria there are two main lineages, being the ones that can move, that is only represented (that we know of) by the Eye Jelly (despite it sharing some considerable resemblances to the Shuttlebug, but will ignore that) and the bentonic and stationary cnidarians (Antozoa), being represented by anemones and coral, having the clades:

‚Ä¢Hexacoralia: Ah yes, anemones. These things that go from the colonial Grue clusters to the terrestrial Marbled Anemone. Just to warn that not everything with ""anemone"" in the name is one, because the Cotton Anemone is a giant aquatic plant.

‚Ä¢Tubulocoralliformes: The lineage composed by tube coral and the Brain Coral

‚Ä¢Primitpcaralliformes: The most basal in the corals, composed by only two species, being the Purple Tree Spire Coral and the blue coral present in the Deep Grand Reef

‚Ä¢Tableticoralliformes: Sister group to the tube coral, they have a flat appearance and include the bleach-making, calcium rich coral, the more flattened coral, Bridge Coral and one of the 2 coral that make the Membrane Tree

‚Ä¢Microcoralliuma: All other coral, nothing much. The group may be poliphyletic but it's what I have.

Now onto bilaterians, I separated them like in real life (deuterostomes x protostomes) despite not being possible the distinguishing of the two groups since we don't have information on their fetus formation. For sakes of simplicity and similarity, let's put like this, or something like ""deuterostomomorpha"" and ""protostomomorpha"". In the protostomes, we have 6 phyla:

‚Ä¢Ananalia: the most basal phylum, being composed by only two living species (that we know of), being the Floater and the Spikey Trap. This phylum shares some similarities with molluscs (in case of the Spikey Trap, cephalopods, and the Floater, monophacaphorans), a basal deuterostome genus called Saccorhythus, and specificly the Floater, some species of deep-sea sea cucubers

‚Ä¢Trilateria/Trilaterizoa/Cyclopsizoa: Composed by only one species, the Shuttlebug (and maybe the Eye Jelly can enter here, but LET'S IGNORE). The main features are a straight mody, tentacles surrounding the mouth and trilateral simetry

‚Ä¢Pseudomollusca: Another phylum composed by only one living species that we know of, being the Reefback. Not much is needed to specify

‚Ä¢Triocula: Composed by 2 species, being the Triops and the two sub-species of Trivalve. Similar to Trilateria and Ananalia, they don't have an anus (at least the Trivalve doesn't)

‚Ä¢Siphonobranchii: another phylum composed by one species, the Ghost Leviathan. As the name suggests, it breathes by siphons, that are located close to the mouth

‚Ä¢Arthropoda: Arthropod like animals, including 16+ well documented extant species, the insects wich inhabit 4546B's land portions, and one known extinct species, that doesn't have a name

About the arthropods, there are various clades to look into. Out of Mandibulata, we have Verpericairidae is a family containing only one species, the Crabsnake, and Cryptotrilobita, where the trilobite fossil is. Entering mandibulata we have Serpercairidae, a family containing the two crawler species, with it's features being the four legs and the UFO-like body. Exocrustacea is a subphylum  wich contains the Chelicerate, Crabsquid, Rock Puncher and the various species of barnacles wich inhabit the planet's oceans. And lastly, Paninsecta, the subphylum that has the insects, the Sea Treader, and the two species from the order Amperenguiliformes (the Ampeel and the Lava Larva)

Now to the deuterostomes, we have two phyla: Echinodermata (Ventgarden and Metal Star) and Chordata, wich contains all other species I didn't talk about untill now (58 species, 61 sub-species).
Entering Chordata, we find that all other creatures from here are vertebrates, because or chordates were vertebrates from the begining, or the invertebrate chordates were extinct. The most basal species in the phylum is the Shadow Leviathan, being most-likely acephalatic (doesn't have a skull). The second most basal is the Skyray (same situation as the Hivemind, there is no place to put it less here)

With basal chordata out of the way, let's specify every clade present in it, shall we? :D

Peeperiformes:

Aghnathan fish-like fauna descended from the ""Alpha Peeper"". As the name suggests, the species in this infraphylum lack a present of a jaw, similar to Earth's lampreys, hagfish and conodonts, but diferent to them, that had/have ""basic"" mouth forms, these vertebrates adapted various forms of eating. The Discusfish in the adult form removes the mouth entierly and replaces it with 2 of it's gill opening, wich open and absorbs green algae, to later store the chlorophyl in the body and do photosynthesis. The Eyeye also loses the mouth, but the reason is unknown. Many hypothesis circle in mind, such as that the adult form of the species only serves as a gametangea factory (only serve to mate). The peepers use a very segmented beak moved by facial muscles. The Reginald uses it's gills to filter out algae from the water. And lastly, the Spinnerfish... I don't know, just maybe it eats filtering water by its siphons

Rayachondrichthies:

Entering the jawed fish, we start at the Rayachondrichthies, a clad analogous to Earth's chondrichthians. Divided between Rayamorpha (Brute Shark and Rays) and Tentaclicephalae (Squid Shark and CUDDLEFISH)

Annomalosteichties:

A large group analagous to bony fish. This clade I will enter in more details, since there is a larger variety of forms and things important to note. The gropu is divided in Exoactinopterigii and Exosarcopterigii. Starting with Exoactinopterigii:

‚Ä¢Deinocephalia: Contains the Garyfish exclusively, not much to talk about

‚Ä¢Multipterigii: A group composed by 4 species: Brinewing, Glow Whale, Bleeder and Mesmer. There are two main groups: Pterichthya (Brinewing) and Squamatichthidea (Mesmer, Glow Whale and Bleeder). About Squamatichthidea, I made an analysis based on the fact that the Mesmer's finns are called ""wings"" and that Glow Whales jump out of the water, and created the hypothesis that they evolve from flying-fish like ancestors that had a evolutionary thendancy to have more fexible joints in the skull

‚Ä¢Trypaichthydae: A family that, well, it's the holefishes

‚Ä¢Arcusiformes: A large group containing Monoculoidea (Crashfish and Spadefish), that are fish with one only eye, Paraenguiliformes (Symbiote and River Prowler), fauna with a similar appearance to eels, and Arcusoidea (Bladderfish, Featherfish subsp., Hoopfish and Spinefish), ""fish"" with antennae-like apendages in the dorsal and pectoral regions

In Exosarcopterigii, we have 3 large groups:

‚Ä¢Neoactinistia: Two-eyed lobe-finned ""fish"" that resemble coelocanths (Sea Monkey, Nootfish and Gasopod)

‚Ä¢Exotetrapodomorpha: Fauna that resemble tetrapods and tetrapodomorphs, divided in Exotetrapoda (divided more in Deinodontia and Cryptosynapsida)(Cryptosuchus, Lava Lizard, Frozen Leviathan, Stalker and Snow Stalker) and Saurichthya (with only the Hoverfish)

‚Ä¢Poliocula: An enormous clade wich contains the ""fish"" with 4 or more eyes. Two grand clades can be devided from it, beind Hexaocula (Gargantuan and Acient Fossil) and Tetraocula (all of the rest). In Tetraocula, there are two significant clades: Dinomandibulata and Ichthycairidimorpha. Dinomandibulata is represented by the basal lineage (Pinnocairid) and the derived lineage (Aquamonstria, that contains the Sea Dragon, Sea Emperor and Pengwing). Ichthycairidimorpha, is cladistically divided into the boomerangs to one side and the Ichthycairidiformes to the other. Ichthycairidiformes has 3 families: Ichthycairidae (Sandshark, Ice Worm, Rockgrub, Theta Specimen, Biter, Blighter and Boneshark), Cairichthydae (Lily Paddled) and Annomaloghnathidae (Reaper Leviathan)



*Flora*: I will not enter into much details about the flora, so please understand

Anyway, for the Fungi part, I put the Mushroom Glob and the Tree Leech as holozoans because of their physicall appearance, I don't know why but they just look like holozoans. In the algae, I separated in Cyanoplantae, Rhodoplantae and Viridiplantae just like it is in real life, not too much to put in here

""Cracks fingers"" short story: i used to have a beautiful (imo) large community with around 930 liter capacity (245 gallons). Had a beautiful lush carpet of hair grass with amazing red rotalia in the background of it's two corners and a large bonsai looking tree with a bunch of epiphytes on and around it. It was thriving or that what i thought. I wanted to post a picture of here and thats when i noticed it had a patch of what i think is algae which looked bad on top of my grass. Didn't think much of it and said i am just gonna get rid of it and it won't take more than a month. The algae made a carpet of its own which was very thick. I have tried every thing from water changes to stariving the tank of light and fertilizer. And of course algae eaters wont touch it. Also it had an episode where it was covered by blue-green slime but that was easily solved. So i just gave up on the tank as it was taking too much of my effort, patience and money. I just kept the light timer on hoping that my plants will miraculously triumph and take over the algae. Left it for almost two years. Now 90% of the water evaporated and the only survivors are the hair grass, some anubias plants and the dreaded algae.

Questions:
1- what is this algae and why it was this stubborn? I was thinking mybe my soil was leaching too much nutrients but i am not sure.

2- i am planning to remove all of my plants and just get the least needy plants and use sand with the least light possible is this useful to prevent this kind of algal growth?

3- in a sample of algae i found some worms/nematodes that isnt visible to the naked eye and a bunch of seed like brown capsules. I will post the pictures if anyone could identify the algae or could notice the cause of my problem.",03 Apr 2024 05:28:06,reddit

**Chatterbox Anthology**

Nen Affinity: Specialist (Favoring conjuration, Manipulation, and Emission

Ability Description: A set of 3 books is tailored to beast hunting, combat, and surveying. It protects and stores magical beast aura in books allowing to be summoned. While also stealing nen beasts from targeted poachers permanently.

¬†

**Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir**, is a leather-bound book used to store information on magical beasts/ nen beasts using physical artifacts of the desired summon, dead or alive (e.g., a feather, claw, scale, or bone fragment).

¬†

¬†**Volume Two: Blather Book**, is a red skin-bound book with noticeable fur on the body and spine and teeth where the pages should be, used to summon any creature stored within Vol. 1 as a manipulated nen beast through a set of conditions. Each stored object is given its own corresponding symbol in Vol. 1.¬†

¬†

**Volume Three: Ebony Keep** is a sealed, indestructible cylindrical container with two compartments. One holds a larger tan rolled map (**Mischief‚Äôs Witness**), a thin metal kaleidoscope (**Oculon**), and a sack of small pins (**Lens and Ocu pins**), and the other holds items with nen currently being tracked. If a pin is placed onto something or an object containing nen is stored within the container, the target's location/ health/ and emotional state are displayed on the map.

¬†

**Conditions and Uses:**

**Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir**

* The user must have either an object, body part, or nen sample linked to the animal
* The sample used for binding must be of a size and shape that allows it to fit onto a page within Volume One.
* Volume One can only hold information on 12 beasts at a time. If 12 beasts occupy the 12 pages already, the user must erase the knowledge of a previously stored beast if a new animal will be added.
* User must inflict a wound upon themselves, allowing blood to mix with the aura of the object. This act creates a symbolic key and a binding contract between the user's nen and the beast
* The user must inscribe a symbol representing the stored creature using their own blood on the same page as the object.
* The user must maintain absolute silence throughout the entire inscription process, as noise renders the contract null and void.

¬†

**Volume Two: Blather Book**

* The user must shed blood by being bitten by the blather book in order to open it and use the summoning paper
* The user must inscribe the beast‚Äôs symbol onto a blank page of the book using blood from the wound. This symbol acts as a conduit through which the nen beast is summoned. This will result in a full summon.
* The user could also inscribe the beast's symbol onto the opposite palm of the bitten limb to activate a partial summon taking one physical or aura based aspect of a beast or form an incomplete version of the beast (e.i. the upper limbs of the beast or wings).
* The book will absorb the user's nen proportional to the strength and complexity of the beast being summoned. (As long as the nen units are available, there is no limit to the number of beasts summoned.)
* Some creatures may require specific environmental conditions to be summoned effectively. For example, a fire-based creature may need to be summoned in a hot and dry environment.
* The user is bound to a state of zetsu during the summoning ritual, although summoned beasts can still defend or attack opponents while still forming. Partial summons are faster than full summons to complete the process
* If a mutual bond between user and nen beasts is formed anytime during the beasts binding to a page in volume one, a personal contract can be created (usually a vow of protection or a set of demands).
* The user can add either one physical aspect of the nen beast or utilize its nen ability onto themselves when the beast is summoned fully only if a contract is formed. 
* If the beast is destroyed or the nen dissipates the ability is cancelled and a hefty tax on nen is expelled proportional to the abilities usefulness, while additionally destroying 1/3 of the stored artifact/ nen inside Volume One.

¬†

**Volume Three: Ebony Keep**

* Requires nen plus the pass phrase to open being ‚ÄúFind that which is hidden.‚Äù
* If a target's belongings are stored in Ebony Keep's storage box, their health, emotional state, Nen use, and location are vaguely displayed on Mischief's Witness.
* Only use is to secure and hold nen emitting and primary tools in Volume three

**Volume Three: Mischief‚Äôs Witness**

* Lens pins can be placed onto spots displayed on Mischief‚Äôs Witness where Ocu pins are located in order to view zoomed in areas. Uses gyo to zoom into Lens pins
* The user must only open Volume Three: Mischief Witness to track and monitor targets through the Ocu pins on them or their belongings. It cannot be used for any other purpose.
* Upon placing an Ocu pin on something, a permanent marker is displayed on Mischief's Witness without distance limitations from user to the pin. However, the marker's detail can‚Äôt be seen beyond 200 meters from the pin's location.
* If the user intends to kill the tracked target, their own location will be revealed to the target. However, the target's location will be crystal clear to the user.
* The user can only place a maximum of 24 Ocu pins at any given time and 3 Lens Pins. Placing additional pins beyond this limit will cause the oldest pin to disappear, removing its marker from Mischief's Witness without informing the user.
* The map requires the user to stay in one place to use.

**Volume Three: Oculon**

* Oculon's clarity is limited to 20 meters; beyond this, images become increasingly blurry and indistinct.
* Clarity depends on the user's focus and visualization skills; maintaining a clear mental image enhances detail.
* Physical contact on Lens pins provides a clear stationary picture of an ocu pin‚Äôs location and a projection of the user‚Äôs en
* Users must remain cautious of prolonged use of Oculon as presence can be sensed through this ability.

¬†

**Volume One‚Äôs Beast Compendium:**

**Page 1: Grishohm‚Äôs Mane ‚ÄúPlunder Fluff‚Äù (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Dried outer scuta from Royal Crest

**Location:** Numere Wetlands and certain rocky shores on coasts of the Loblolly Bay and Gorteau

**Description:** Colony type magical beast exhibiting extreme absorbative properties concerning aura. Appearance is identical to normal brown costal algae with a soft looking appearance but reality are similar in anatomy to a siphonophore. Excretes a low potency stimulant that when absorbed through skin contact manipulates inflected into a for state of ten. If Grishohm‚Äôs Mane is exposed to aura growth and duplication increases at an alarming rate compared to normal rates. Has the ability to split itself into segments or propel portions of colony up to 8 meter away. Any aura received by separated colonies have been observed to relay all aura back to original colony and received by the royal crest (the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù or the colony). Similar to a flat barnacle the queen crest can exist disconnected to the main colony and still receive aura to produce more cells.

**Uses and Summons:**

* Upon summoning user will receive a royal crest, this can be placed on any surface including flesh (Usual placement being the roof of the mouth), once placed use will receive a thin colony of Grishohm‚Äôs Mane covering a portion of body.
* User can freely manipulate the colony ‚Äòs location and shape through conscious orders from the royal crest
* Any contact by opponent will leave behind residual fluff, will then actively begin to spread from opponents nen output 30% of which will be siphoned back to the royal crest and absorbed by the user

**Drawbacks:**

* Highly ineffective against transmuters once Hatsu is initiated especially if the ability almost purely transmuter
* Absorption qualities of Plunder Fluff affect user as well so skin location where colony units are must be kept under a constant state of Zetsu or Ryu at 0% open up weak spots in defense

¬†

**Page 2: Castle Tegu (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Large scale plate from right pectoral

**Location:** West Rocky Gorges of the Kakin Empire

**Description:** 3 meter tall Bipedal capable carnivorous reptiles with the potential to learn human language gifted in hunting. The body of a Castle Tegu is covered in thick incredibly durable scale plating that also varies in color which determines the reptile‚Äôs temperament. Grey scales often act headstrong and confident, Black scales often act short-tempered and violent, Green scales often act logical and controlled, Beige often are stoic and cunning, or Yellow often are spastic and impulsive. While Tegus found bearing white stripes are capable of nen use without the evidence of Hatsu development but evidence of Ko. Pack behavioral mentality often in groups from 5 ‚Äì 20 with 1 to 2 striped Tegus among the hunting party, prefer prey regularly that puts at a power disadvantage, with prey being twice their size, speed, strength, or potential. Additionally, Castle Tegus can freely manipulate internal body temperature at will, while naturally are cold blooded, the presence of a internal blood vessel layer can significantly heat the body and blood temperature to drastic highs capable of catching fire. This is only a controllable feature in striped Tegus through aura control as these blood vessel layers reactive through the 4 principles, while non-striped still have these same properties but require outside aura to observe this feature. Moreover, a barbaric behavior seen in these creatures (striped) while injured or on the defensive have the ability to project heated blood from wounds through muscle control.

**Uses and Summons:**

* Upon summoning user will have a 1/3 chance to receive a striped castle tegu, reptile be summoned within 5 feet of user and will not know the context of the situation at hand upon use.
* User will typically be seen as Pack leader and able to strategies group attacks, this sentiment diminishes with pack size
* Contact with nen of any type quickly heats the skin to burning levels and is relatively harmless to Tegu

**Drawbacks:**

* Beast with high intelligence, unpredictability, and independence while summoned occasional disobedience and trickery. Higher the temperament, striped, or pack numbers could result in mutiny (leadership + strength are key to establish pack alpha status when summoned)
* High nen cost for the number of units conjured
* Cold sensitive

**Established Contract:** Temperature manipulation and Muscle armor available for use by user in exchange for Tegu free will while summoned and vow of protection of their habitat.

**Page 3: Enigmi Eel (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Full right secondary dorsal gyrofin

**Location:** No known habitat; Nomadic in nature and not usually in groups of no more than 2, outside of mating season. Found all over the globe high in the atmosphere.

**Description:** More commonly known as ‚Äúthe Whales of the Sky‚Äù are large flying creatures growing anywhere from 20 to 35 meters long that resemble a translucent multi-finned Unagi Eel with clear reflective scales. It is said that seeing a bright light moving in the sky that is different colors from the stars at night could be these flying beasts dancing above us and are a sign of either good luck or future chaos. Their lifespans are known but no evidence of a nest or egg mound has been located, consensus is that lifetime extends further than a century and mating occur near the end on an eel‚Äôs life birthing one to two offspring at a time. Adult bodies of Eels have one main central dorsal gyrofin, one set of two secondary side dorsal fins, one set of two smaller extender fin rays, and two large pelvic gyrofins that control a majority of the eels‚Äô flight and speed. The eels are natural emitters and manipulators having the ability to project their nen or mold it into tail like extensions to use their ability. Through sunlight reflection or oil secretion mixing into their nen gives the aura both hypnotic and disorienting qualities to aid in the beasts‚Äô relative complications to fighting physically only through forceful gusts of wind. On occasion, these eels can also cloak themselves. Something to note, the oily secretion from the skin of the eel has a highly psychoactive property the puts individuals into paralysis, if collected can be used as a non-lethal poison for kidnapping or interrogation.

**Uses and Summons:**

* Upon summoning the user will always receive a 35-meter Enigmi Eel at 50 meter above them which will reflect the current emotional state of the user (Happiness, determination, or anger have the most effect.
* Within a 50-to-75-meter range eels can project illusionary doubles of themselves, illusionary attacks, doubles of the user, mirages of obstacles, landmasses, or allies. Additionally, can let out bright lights or imperceivable dashes short distances away (about 8 meters).
* Intensity of attack patterns and potency of illusory nen increases in proximity of the attacker to the eel.

**Drawbacks:**

* While nen beast is under control by user range and potency of illusory nen is decreased but still affects them, is worsened by the damage incurred by eel
* Less effective during storms or large overcast weather, worse during rain or in a negative mindset or depressed.

**Established Contract:** Illusionary nen available for use by user in return for a simple Vow of protection as well as establishing an area of seclusion or a safe area sky nature reserve for juvenile eels

**Page 4:** **General Toad (Nen Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** residual nen inside torn cloth

**Origin of capture:** A leader of a poaching sect seeking revenge for losing his team while trying to acquire rare pelts in the Balsa Islands

**Description:** Large 4-meter orange bull frog dressed in general fatigues and war-time armor carrying a heavy metal club. Smokes cigars and is the common stereotypical army hard-ass personality. General Toad is a remote targeting nen beast with three modes of attack: sentinel stance, assault mode, and mode: blitzkrieg, each have their own importance to defense, offense, and complete blind fury. While being an extension of the users nen, although being a stolen ability, the toad itself having its own thoughts, personality, and feelings, it recognizes that its original user no longer is its present one and treats him as such. General Toad is usually grouchy and rude to its users and enemies.

**Uses and abilities:**

* Upon summoning the user will become the safeguard and General toad will automatically be set in Sentinel stance defense. Usually around 2 ‚Äì 3 meters away from the object labeled the safeguard although the object labeled the safeguard can be changed at will
* **Sentinel Stance**: General Toad maintains a set circle around the safeguard at a 5-meter radius, during which the toads‚Äô reflexes and agility are enhanced to a significant degree as long as he stays withing the outlined 5-meter circle. Benefits only valid for defensive tactics and not offensive moves, Toad cannot use the club while in sentinel stance.
* **Assault Mode**: Once and order is given that requires the toad to leave the circle Assault mode automatically begins. Or once General Toad is made to touch the iron club assault mode initiates and an order is to attack the most dangerous threat on the battlefield. Assault mode is capable of multiple attacks including the club as well as its tongue having the ability to transform into a machine gun, a cannon, or a flamethrower.
* **Mode: Blitzkrieg**: Only useable in a situation where the toad is in a pure state of rage or when the threat of the users life is completely in danger. Murderous aura envelopes the toad and transforms changing from orange to red growing horns and thick armored plating, Toad becomes bipedal and a spike in all physical traits. General toad loses all sense of self reverting to a state of feral behavior, focuses on the most powerful attacker or the closest living being.

**Drawbacks:**

* Just an a-hole at times
* If safeguard is transferred an new circle must be drawn to begin protection
* Assault mode and blitzkrieg often disregard the safety of the user or their allies, si caution must be given when used.
* Blitzkrieg quickly uses significant amounts of the nen used to summon the nen beast Grishohm‚Äôs Mane can be used to lengthen the duration of the summon.

¬†

**Page 5:** **Rockbill Vex ‚ÄùPik‚Äù (Magical Beast)**

**Bound Artifact:** Feathers from the left wing of a juvenile Vex

**Location:** Small, scattered nests burrowed in the eastern lands of Yorbia

**Description:** A blue, black, and white painted bird about 112 centimeters tall and a wingspan of 225 centimeters males are larger than females usually. Only known remaining wild member of its kind is being protected by Fisher, being raised since it was a hatchling. Species was hunted to borderline extinction over the bird‚Äôs blood having rejuvenating qualities while also being an ingredient in a illegal drugs. Rockbill Vex‚Äôs are one of the fastest flying bird‚Äôs the planet having the power to influence are currents and static electricity through the metallic point at the end of their beak giving them the ability to trigger lightning and gale-like winds. The Vex has superior eyesight through its unconscious use of gyo as he can see focused images from up to 1-2 kilometers away perfect for tracking.

**Uses and Summons:**

* Pik is never usually stored inside Volume One: Beastmaster‚Äôs Memoir, as Pik is considered Fisher‚Äôs loyal companion or pet. Pik is never further than 3 kilometers from Fisher all times if so a condition will be activated where a red compass arrow appears on the left hand of Fisher after Pik goes beyond 10 Kilometers of Fisher the bird will be sent back to the book.
* Pik‚Äôs aerial maneuverability is superior being able to turnaround on a dime at Mach 1+ speeds. The faster the speed the sturdier the birds‚Äô wings and beaks are.
* Combined with the increasing speeds Pik can generate ladders of lightning across the sky at will generating energy and electricity further up the sky they get.",01 Apr 2024 23:44:06,reddit
607,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1btlv4y,No babies produced,"I have 3 berried female crystal red shrimp last mid feb and was supposed to give birth by mid march but its 1st week of april now and still theres no baby seen, they molt perfectly fine, no deaths they are healthy. Ihave 17 females (12females are old enough, 5 are still in their teens) and 7males. Heres my water parameters:

Gdh 7
Gkh 0-1
Nitrite 0
Nitrate 0
Water Temp 22-24celcius
Distilled Water top off
10-15% water change weekly 

ihave java fern, java moss, willow moss, a driftwood, 2000lumens led light, indian almond leaves, sponge filter and airstone, amazon frogbit, green algae on glass and biofilm

Only 10days old 11 guppy fry tankmates and a bunch of pest snail, (i even put 6 baby blue jelly and 1 baby fire red shrimp, only 2 baby shrimp remains and they are 6weeks old right now and there are eggs forming in their saddle)

The feeding rotation are 2-3times a week with mox protein and mineral pellets, fish flake food, frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and blanch veggies omce a week 

can anyone advice me on why theres no babies roaming around or what im lacking? Thank you very much",01 Apr 2024 21:15:25,reddit
608,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bt1iw6,pH Help,"This is water from our buffered well. First pic is from my oldest, biggest, most heavily stocked and planted tank w/ the largest piece of driftwood. Second is from a smaller and newer tank with fewer plants and fish and smaller pieces of driftwood. I see a difference, but I feel like I'm crossing my eyes trying to interpret a reading. What would you say the pH is in these two tanks?

I also feel like the water gets slightly more neutral the longer it sits, to an extent. I did a reading a couple days ago with fresh water and had to use the high range pH test (looked like ~7.8), but I feel like we're within the normal range now. Is that possible?

...and am I over thinking this? I know fish can acclimate to a range, and everyone seems healthy now (had callamanus worms and a blue-green algae bloom in the second tank which is why I ripped it down and started over). When I saw the high pH I figured the water guys adjusted something last time they serviced the filters so I panic bought acid buffer yesterday. Took a reading today to dose appropriately and am thinking I may be ok.

Any help or advice is appreciated!",01 Apr 2024 07:43:49,reddit

Jason hated traveling through The Void; that unknowable space between worlds, the infinite cracks in the fabric of reality, through which divinity traveled the multiverse; the bloody place was hell on his senses.¬† No matter how many times he was sent through it, it always felt like he was somehow falling in three different directions, and a few different dimensions, all at once.¬† The experience had left him puking his guts out on the shoes of more than one noble lord or lady, once he finally materialized onto whatever backwater planet his current mission sent him to.¬† It had gotten better, or at least he had gotten better at holding down his lunch, after the eighth summoning... or was it the tenth?¬† He couldn‚Äôt quite remember at the moment.¬†¬†

¬†

The lack of direction was hardly the only ‚Äòselling point‚Äô for why The Void was such a pain to deal with.¬† As the name implied, the space between worlds was devoid of anything and everything.¬† He could still vaguely remember the first time he was shunted through the place; he had thought he was blind.¬† The complete lack of light in the place made it basically impossible to tell if you had your eyes open or closed at any given moment.¬† Hell, he still wasn‚Äôt 100% if he even HAD eyes while in this place.¬† Heck it was not beyond possibility that the more delicate organs simply didn‚Äôt exist while transitioning, only reappearing once the traveler was spat out into the new world.¬†

¬†

Worst of all though, had to be the utter lack of ‚Äòstuff‚Äô within The Void.¬† There was something... unsettling, about ‚Äúfalling‚Äù through space without the feeling of air, water, dust, ANYTHING touching your skin.¬† Ok well maybe he was being a bit hyperbolic saying ‚Äúanything‚Äù, he could feel the clothes on his body.¬† He had thought maybe it was just his imagination, his mind desperately trying to force some semblance of order onto this strange and order-less place.¬† That thought, however, had been dispelled after... was it the fourth or fifth trip?¬† He wasn‚Äôt sure why it took him so long to finally try it, but he had finally gotten around to trying to touch something.¬† To no one's surprise, there was nothing to touch within this place; well, nothing other than himself.¬† His skin, his clothes, his hair; all of it was real, the only real things in this bizarre place.¬†

¬†

He claimed that the lack of stimuli was the biggest issue with The Void, but the more he thought about it, the less sure he was that that was really the case.¬† Without stimuli it became increasingly difficult to measure time.¬† Each trip was somehow an eternity that passed in an instant, while also being a moment that stretched out for what felt like an epoch.¬† Part of him assumed it had to be a fairly short period of time spent in this place, the human mind was not exactly known to do well in utter sensory deprivation.¬† But another part of him concluded that he must spend ungodly amounts of time stuck in this perfect darkness.¬† Why else would he always materialize with eyes dilated and skin so pale it was like he hadn‚Äôt seen a lick of sunlight for decades?¬†

¬†

With an unnatural suddenness, Jason‚Äôs attention snapped back to the present.¬† He could suddenly feel air rushing against the back of his head, his clothes flapped and snapped in this abrupt hurricane force gale.¬† Even with his eyelids tightly shut, his eyes sent wave after wave of pain crashing into his brain.¬† Light streamed through his squinted lids.¬† He wasn‚Äôt 100%, but experience told him that he was either smack dab in front of a raging inferno... or he had just materialized in such a way as to be staring directly at this world‚Äôs star.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

...Stars?¬†

¬†

After the initial shock of materialization wore off, Jason realized quite quickly that he was in fact falling.¬† A hiccup, made into a proper problem by the fact that he never had gotten around to trying skydiving back on Earth, so he was not really sure how to go about righting himself.¬† He tried spreading out his limbs, having some ambient knowledge that more surface area meant more wind resistance, which meant a (albeit small) decrease in his velocity towards the ground.¬† It had been little more than luck, but his right arm spasmed for a moment and remained locked to his side.¬† The sudden rise of air resistance on only half of his body, caused him to flip over, finally sparing his precious eyes from the harsh sunlight.¬†

¬†

Cracking his eyes just the tiniest bit open, the world around him was a smudgy mess.¬† Even with his eyes having managed to adjust to some small degree, it still hurt to have them open.¬† An experience made all the worse by the wind buffeting his face and threatening to dry them out.¬† He closed his eyes and blinked a few times.¬† Fighting through the discomfort, he tried opening his eyes a little more.¬† This time as his eyes opened, the world came into crisp view.¬†

¬†

The sky was mostly clear, allowing him to marvel at its breathtaking orange color.¬† A few puffy green clouds dotted the otherwise unmarred horizon.¬† He could make out the faint outline of two small moons, barely visible in the midday light.¬† The third moon was slightly harder to miss; he had seen his fair share of supermoons back on Earth, but they paled in comparison.¬† This Ubermoon as he decided to call it, was clear as can be and took up a good fourth of the sky.¬†

¬†

A stray curiosity flickered through his mind about how this world‚Äôs oceans must be affected by three moons, and what kind of effects the close proximity of the Ubermoon, would have on the tides.¬† He decided to shelve that particular thought for now, figuring that once he was safely back on Terra Firma he could spend all the time he wished admiring the sky and moons.¬† The ground seemed particularly enamored with him, apparently wanting to get a nice face-to-face greeting, as it rushed to meet him at what he guessed was probably about 200-300 MPH.¬†

¬†

A part of Jason had to chuckle at how calm he was.¬† If he had to guess, he had been falling for a good two minutes now.¬† His previous record was a measly two to three seconds before his courage had run dry and he had cast a Slow Fall spell.¬† As the wind continued to whip at his face, Jason decided that he had had his fun.¬† He closed his eyes, he breathed deeply, and extended his senses outwards searching for the telltale signs of magic in this world.¬† Immediately he could feel it in the air, he could sense it spiderwebbed across the planet in great magical Leylines.¬† Magic was heavy upon this world, heavier than he had ever felt before.¬† He mused that with this density of Aether, even the common folk were like as not to be proficient mages.¬† It wouldn‚Äôt surprise him if a common farmer in this world had more aptitude for magic than a few of the high mages he‚Äôd run into during previous incarnations.¬†

¬†

So intoxicated by the power of this world, Jason decided to try casting a spell that had evaded him in many of his past lives.¬† Pulling the raw power into himself he spoke the word, Fly.¬† For the briefest of moments, he felt his descent slow; felt the magical power wash over his body as it tried to fight the forces of gravity.¬† Then he felt the searing agony as this world‚Äôs mana flowed through his body.¬† The sudden burst of pain broke his concentration on the spell.¬† As quickly as it started, the feeling passed, his body once more becoming as buoyant as a flesh filled lead balloon.¬† A nearly imperceptible \*ding\* went off as the spell failed; sadly, Jason could not hear it over the wind screaming past his ears.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

He pondered why the spell had started to work, only for him to be consumed with immense pain.¬† Stranger still was that apparently the pain did not translate to actual damage taken. It had felt like his hands were about to burn away, but according to the logs he had taken a whooping 0 damage, fire or otherwise.¬† ‚ÄúAnother thing to explore once I‚Äôm safely on the ground‚Äù, he thought to himself.¬†

¬†

Seeing as how the spell had started to work, Jason deduced that he must have just used the wrong word of power.¬† This was not entirely surprising; he was still using the language settings from his last mission... maybe this world used different terms? He thought he remembered something similar to this happening to him way back when, if he remembered right, he thought it was referred to as ‚Äòmana burn‚Äô. Given the limited amount of time he had for trial and error, he decided to simply cut out the middleman and use Primal.¬† Sure, saying anything, much less casting anything, using the elder tongue took far longer, but it did have the appeal of being a universal language... Real shame the Gods hoarded the knowledge of the language's existence.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

Hells he had only learned about it by sheer luck.¬† Having caught the tail end of a conversation between two Divines, after he had mysteriously dropped dead during one of his missions.¬† Then he had had to game the system for several incarnations to squirrel away enough credits, to buy the upgrade that let him translate and speak the blasted thing.¬†

¬†

‚ÄúGrg‚ÄôThun dilock aragos nevadool IMPERITOS. ¬† Eloom daruso igora myrousnar barumbarae‚Äú, he chanted.¬† Again, his body felt lighter than air, and again just as fast as it started his body was racked with a searing pain.¬† Another almost silent chirp, this one just ever so slightly louder, sounded as the spell fizzled out. Once more Jason failed to notice the background noise over the gale force howling in his ears.¬†

¬†

Gritting his teeth through the pain, he tried to understand what was happening.¬† He noticed that his hands were covered in blisters as if he had just grabbed a red-hot coal directly out of a firepit.¬† He checked his stats and found everything in proper order.¬† He still had the Divine Protections, and his life bar didn‚Äôt show a single point of fire damage, so what the hell was going on?¬†¬†

¬†

The spell had been perfect, but for whatever reason Jason knew that it simply hadn't had enough power to activate properly.¬† A sickening thought flashed through his head.¬† Yes, it was possible... the world was flush with mana, but that mana was crude; unrefined. ¬† Was it possible that since this world was so rich in crude ambient Aether, that casters had to actively purify and distill their mana before it could be used?¬† The first hints of fear started to creep into the corners of Jason‚Äôs mind.¬† He snuck a peak at the ground, and immediately wished he hadn‚Äôt.¬† He could already make out the rough outlines of some kind of merchant caravan traveling between the massive trees.¬† He knew that he didn‚Äôt have time to distill the necessary mana to try and cast the Fly spell again.¬†

¬†

Thinking quickly, he decided that the only safe option was to use a simple Slow Fall spell.¬† It wasn‚Äôt glorious, and the abrupt change in descent speed would feel like shit, and make him look worse upon landing, but at least there didn‚Äôt look to be too many witnesses around to see him land like a goober.¬† Taking another deep breath, he pulled in as much ambient mana as he could from his surroundings.¬† Working as fast as his body could, he purified and distilled the mana down.¬† He could feel the immense power of it, as bolts of magic coursed across his skin.¬†

¬†

He could feel that mana straining against him, singeding off the hair along his arms.¬† He tried to ignore the pain, he just needed to last a little longer, but the process BURNED. According to every system based data point he had access to, Jason was 10,000% fine. According to what his body was telling him, his blood had been replaced with magma.¬†

¬†

Once more he spoke the word of power.¬† He channeled every ounce of the pure mana into the spell, willing the arcane words into existence with all his might.¬† Mana flew from his skin, infusing the script with more power than it had any right to be able to handle.¬† Pale blue lights began to swirl around his body, he could feel the effects of the magic taking hold.¬† He could feel his body becoming lighter and lighter.¬† As joy flooded his heart, he heard it.¬† A high-pitched whine, that was getting louder and louder.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

Then with a sickening \*snap\* he saw his spell shatter apart.¬† The excess mana, having finally strained the arcane construct to its breaking point.¬† As if in some twisted mockery, the spell folded back in on itself.¬† The surge of magic rewriting and reforging the spell into something new.¬† He felt his body return back to its normal weight, then increase.¬† Heavier and heavier he became, his weight increasing quintuple fold.¬† In addition to the added weight came added speed, he rocketed towards the ground, faster and faster.¬† He didn‚Äôt even have time to curse his luck, before he hit the ground, headfirst.¬†

¬†

As his body, gear, items.... basically, everything that was even tangentially ‚ÄúJason‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúJason‚Äù adjacent, were turned to a fine mist. Two separate, yet equally important things happened nearly simultaneously. First, a single, otherwise unassuming, gold coin pulsed a vibrant cerulean before shattering into countless shards. As the energy rippled outwards, time seemed to slow to a nearly imperceptible stop. This first effect was both heavily fortunate and deeply problematic for Jason.¬† As time slowed, the core of what made Jason, Jason, was able to activate a single automated ability, \[Ignore Pain\]. The ability did its best to bank the entirety of the damage influx, turning the sudden burst of damage into a much more manageable damage over time effect. Sadly, as would be a running theme for Jason in the immediate future, the sheer level of incoming damage tore through the ability's limiters like a cannonball through wet tissue paper.

General Redlina's lone transport arrived at Gheinar in the early hours of a particularly cold morning. The large abhuman marched down the ramp flanked only by two Valyrrans & two Minthelians. Her aide Lieutenant Luciel who was coughing regularly and barely able to stay standing straight after the wounds she had sustained and still not gotten treated properly. And a lone stormtrooper who hid her face behind her visor and rebreather but her armour was scarred and scratched telling a tale of a violent and chaotic battle. The two Minthelians Captain Poppy and Flo had tagged along with the general on route to the northern front.

Redlina however was as she always looked, her bulky uniform and coat billowing behind her, red abhuman eyes hidden under the peak of her iconic officers cap. She was ignoring the pain from her own injury but unless those watching paid close attention it was hard to tell she was still recovering from a stab wound by the traitors knife.

Redlina was here to speak with McMahon, the 532nd was the backbone of her main force after the Sigmauer task force had been pulled out from under her and she was here to answer whatever questions the colonel might have in person, as promised. She had not spoken to him since contingency V7 had been enacted. She marched through the cities citadel following firections to the main HQ saluting every guardsman she passed.

*East of Crowton & Burron: Imperial Siege Lines*

At the Rok, Colonel Zerac was awoken to another explosion and the sounds of ork warcries. The orks were launching another attack, the 9th this week alone. Most never even got close to the lines but this one sounded bad. He rolled off the ammo crate he had been using as a bed collected his kit and rushed out of the deep dugout and into the trenches passing scrambling formations of Valyrran troops that rushed to their positions. Amidst the shouts of ""Bayonets"" and barking orders, the colonel walked on nodding to the young nervous looking troops under his command or giving them brief words of encouragement and pats on the back. Meanwhile explosions rained down all over the trench network from innaccurate ork fire and the crack of imperial artillery firing in reply, waging a war of counter battery across the snow filled warzone.

As he arrived at the command dugout the sounds of battle began in earnest orks had reached 1k meters from the first line and lasguns, heavy bolters grenade launchers and more had started opening up. The Colonel found his other half, Colonel Mirai already barking instructions into a voxset and moving icons around on the command table. Ebkirche had been summoned and warnings had been issued to the Kriegers to the south about the scale of this attack.

The Valyrrans would not falter and stood ready to weather the green tide once again.

////

Outskirts of Waycross: Northern Front

Bluekilla Snazzda had recieved the bosses orders not long ago. ""Find da nearest humie settlement and krump em"" His roving band of orks numbering some 5 thousand had seen the explosions and fighting happening over by Waycross and had not wanted to be left out, thing is he realised very quickly he was outgunned and outnumbered and in an odd show of competency had elected to launch a dawn attack on the humies from the northwest and western directions as they started moving north. It remained to be seen if his boyz had been seen sneaking closer using their peculiar white camouflage to mask their approach, he had a lot of looted tanks and warbuggies ready to begin a frantic armoured charge when the fighting got tough but he himself was outfitted with his meganob armour and customshoota ready to have a good fight.

5k orks with mechanised troops, artillery and tanks are launching a surprise raid, their bloodlust is high so dont expect any retreat.

////

*North of Fort Ko'Var: Formerly Saints Gate*

Task force Liberation was on the move, thousands of infantry and vehicles began moving out from Liberation heights only a few miles from the fort. They had plans to begin setting up siege lines, digging in their artillery while they still had the element of surprise the idea was to keep the tanks hidden in the forest for now, ready to begin the attack at any time. Troops sat in fox holes and prayed to the Emperor awaiting the word to bring the fight to the T'au.

Colonel Lilzton Stood on the back of a command salamander scout vehicle with a detailed map of the fort and all current force positions outlined, Morale was high he just hoped it stayed that way once the casualties started coming in.

////

*Westbridge: Northern Front Imperial Mountain Command*

Lion had been woken once again to the sound of another incident he was beginning to get very tired of it and Valtin was really pushing for a crackdown on the civilian populace after last nights attack on the warehouses.

When Valtin came to see him for the 6th time that morning Lion nodded. A demonstration needs to be made. Valtin had left with a terrifying smile on his face, what he might do remained a mystery.

////

Major Minton and the very large Valyrran force with her set out today towards Waycross with the intention of joining the frontline and setting out for the fort itself. The Valyrrans had gone from the smallest contingent to probably the largest now and the rows of heavy armoured vehicles poured out of the town for hours all heading south towards the newly found crossing, squads of centaur light carriers, hydras and hellhounds set out for the bridge itself eager to get to Waycross as quickly as possible under Captain Donly's command while the infantry, Crassus and Macharius heavies went south.

As reports of fighting at the river had reached command, waves of Vulture gunships had been scrambled to scour the snowy plains and find the escaped T'au force, Minton had orders to divert a hunting party which would cooperate with the Rathian scouts in the area to find and eradicate this potential thorn in their side.

Squads of elite Valyrran specialists now began a search pattern if they found anything or a team didnt call in Vultures would descend on the area in minutes. Command was not taking any risks as all logistical supplies needed for the siege had to pass through these areas and there was zero tolerance for any losses.

////

*Fortress Sha'Yo: T'au Northern Frontline.*

At Sha'Yo Fortress Captain Finn stood on the battlements looking out south, he had been told the stealth convoy had returned across the icebreaker plains and was due to arrive today. He had still been waiting on reports of how the rest of the fighting had unfolded across the frontlines after his own only semi successful strike, he atleast hoped the enemy no longer underestimated them going forward. His forces morale had stayed steady despite the losses and he had doubled the number of drone patrols incase of any Imperial counter attack, he would not be caught unprepared.

////

Both Imperial and T'au commands in the area looked at meteorological reports and both sides came to the same conclusion. A potent winter storm was about to hit the northern front which would drop temperatures considerably. All forces were advised to prepare themselves for a period of intense snow, with -30 to -50 degree weather with even worse conditions in the mountains and low visibility expected until the storms pass. These conditions will hamper air support especially.",16 May 2024 08:13:46,reddit

D20|This staristocrat's badge of office¬†
:--|:--
1|is a golden diadem which projects a hologram of Old Sol from its highest tine, as well as the rest of Man's Cradle-System orbiting about it.
2|is a hideous diamondoid mask made in the image of an alien demi-god from whom their esteemed house claims descent.
3|is an auroran magneto-cloth cape which flares with the oscillations of subtle fields.
4|is a porous meteoric amulet that echoes with the music of the spheres.
5|is a blade of enchained magnetic monopoles channeling ouroboric tangles of plasma - ever-glowing, their patterned glows expressing the cyclical yet self-degrading nature of the cosmos, able to cut through all but the most unnaturally enforced materials.
6|is a scepter containing a degenerate micro-verse within its topping globe.
7|is a battered helmet pulled from the suit of one of the first humans to reach outer space.
8|is a battle standard bearing the heraldry of their family, and topped with the head of a lion, preserved and animated to roaring unlife by cybernetic tubes woven through its flesh and bone.
9|is a halo of abstract mathematics, written directly on the fabric of space-time rather than mere matter.
10|is a pauldron of fused silicon, the remains of an artificial intelligence which almost overcame humanity.
11|is a dilating-lens lantern of an indestructible, orange-green alloy - fully unleashed, its actinic brilliance can guide in a ship from high orbit.
12|is a vial of their own, genetically-perfected blood, crystallized into a ruby-like gem.
13|is a crown of golden rings hovering about each other, each engraved with the zodiac of a different solar system.
14|is a famous artifact of Earth preserved within a temporal stasis-orb.
15|is a set of infrasonic pan pipes that can manipulate the minds of men and machine alike.
16|is a holy book written by the first settler of their world, in an eclectic script unreadable by anyone yet living.
17|is a shield with a brazen, hypercubic boss and a rippling purplish forcefield about.
18|is a labrys bearing edges honed to subatomic sharpness with whetstones hewn from the preternaturally dense heart of a collapsed star.
19|is a bowl holding a fractal bonzai grafted with branches of every fruit-bearing tree of humanity's homeworld.
20|is the head-sized smaragdine egg of some voidborne beast, the inevitable hatching of which is said to herald the end of the universe.

D20|This staristocrat's holdings¬†
:--|:--
1|lie under a dimming sun, weakened by its fusion-harvest which forms the foundation of the staristocrat's wealth.
2|contain no life-bearing worlds, its population sustained only by technocratic hydro-pneumatic despotism.
3|bear the glassy-green sheen and asymmetrical mutations left by ancient nuclear war.
4|are mineral-rich but poor in organics and water, expending most of their export-wealth on life-giving imports just to survive.
5|produce a unique and inimitable spice, and are thus coveted by an extra-solar rival.
6|are either watery or gaseous, with dry, solid ground an unimaginable luxury - the populace living on great rafts or aerostats.
7|have recently absorbed a mass of refugees fleeing a black swan xeno-threat.
8|were enclosed from the common space of comet-cowboys, who plague it with their raids to this day.
9|are nestled among the ruins of an extinct alien civilization, probed only gently for fear of waking their automatic guardians.
10|are slowly but surely having their life-giving atmospheres stripped away by the rapacious solar wind of their red gigantism-suffering sun.
11|are deliberately kept ignorant of the wider galactic community to reduce their capacity to revolt, and so that the ruling class can portray themselves as deific through their technological capabilities.
12|are undergoing a long and delicate process of terraforming which structures cultural and religious cycles around these artificial seasons and critical thresholds.
13|are overgrown with a police state only nominally under the staristocrat's authority, and the computational bureaucracy that's arisen to process all their surveillance.
14|are infamous for their permissiveness, and abound in every sort of vice.
15|are torn apart on a planetary scale for the sake of resource-harvest and industry, and what unruptured ground exists is blanketed in choking smog outside sealed habitats.
16|were recently seized from a treasonous vassal and bestowed upon this staristocrat - the old holder's sympathizers still lurk within the population, evading the claws of inquisition.
17|exist mostly fictitiously, as moving shell-games of companies and titles.
18|are centered on an ecumenopolis with some roads paved with stones hewn before humanity's ancestors came down from the trees - its corners hide occultic dens of our darkest imaginings.
19|are generally scorching, deserts or liquid hells, their structures mirrored and extending tubes of heat exchanges and radiators like a seraphim wings.
20|are verdant in all forms of life - none go hungry, yet many are eaten, and a clan of masked physicians go about the populace to rebuke the tides of plague.

D20|This staristocrat is attended by¬†
:--|:--
1|a harem of genetically-engineered Willendorfian Venuses, bearing a continuous stream of heirs who will duel over the matter of their inheritance in the arena of their cr√®che.
2|artful historians hunchbent over data-tablets, preserving every moment and detail of the staristocrat's life in imperishable crystalline records.
3|nigh-invisible bodyguards swaddled in light-bending metamaterial cloaks, heat haze auras ready to strike down any offense against their master.
4|clanking cyborg-knights - behind their cuirasses are tanks preserving the most loyal and chivalrous parts of their mortal brains.
5|slaves bearing explosive collars - the tribute of many conquered worlds.
6|a squadron of musclebound eunuch-janissaries raised from childhood with size- and strength-stimulating hormones and non-stop brainwashing.
7|clones of themself educated according to various traditions as diverse yet biologically-partial advisors.
8|the cryogenically-preserved heads of their forefathers, which sometimes dispense shivering, crackling counsel.
9|hovering laser-turrets fitted with targeting algorithms able to anticipate their master's desire to kill before it's consciously felt.
10|an enormous parrot with impeccable skill at mimicry, whose mind has been overwritten with every song recorded by humanity up until the time of its creation.
11|a pair of titanic wolfdogs, with metallic teeth that could rend apart a tank and hides that have turned aside artillery-shells.
12|the plush animatronic companion of their childhood, its digital personality updated to be a competent advisor.
13|a caste of butlers who've served their family for generations, bred like pedigreed dogs.
14|a choir singing their praises, the choir's lungs replaced with cybernetic jet-intakes slatted between ribs, so that they might sing unceasing.
15|a former whipping boy, their oldest friend, bearing the delicate scars of tremendously sophisticated tortures.
16|tumbling jesters dressed in patchworks of impossible colours captured from the coronas of half-real suns.
17|technotheologic angels dancing through the air on wings of incandescent blazons.
18|abductees from primitive worlds fitted with neural implants which make them believe they are simply in an extended dream.
19|a team of chefs who can prepare the delicacies of a dozen worlds, never repeating the same twice in their master's lifetime.
20|grey masters of anagathic science, whisper-arguing over the injections and ointments that will quicken them a while longer.

D20|This staristocrat's court¬†
:--|:--
1|is entertained by a vapourous alien intelligence which takes possession of lesser courtiers through a fanciful hookah.
2|has its lesser members partially memory-wiped when they attend it - able to recall their skills, yet unable to remember much of their own identities, and so how to apply those skills for personal benefit.
3|is deliberately, performatively humble, held in barns and suchlike.
4|is overlooked by a cine-dome showing stars, moons, and constellations in fortuitous alignments.
5|is addicted to novelty, and constantly seeks new performances and grotesques.
6|is made up nepotistically of their siblings who did not win the contest to inherit the throne.
7|are waited on hand and foot by fragile ceramic robots imprinted with the tightly-enchained engrams of political criminals.
8|takes place entirely remotely - members are provided radio-devices with frequencies that trigger voice-like vibrations in great bells this staristocrat is in the constant presence of.
9|were at first ironically and now legitimately entranced by a bloody cult of sacrifice and agonies.
10|has been forced to accept elected representatives from among the populace by a revolt - to the grumblings of those who attained their positions through inheritance.
11|is wracked by a scandal involving mistresses overspending from public coffers.
12|is perpetually-wrapped in augmented-reality projections of mythic mimesis.
13|is burrowed among the roots of the biggest mountain of their throne-world, so that it could survive all but the most devastating attacks.
14|are all accompanied by a member of an order of courtesan-assassins implanted with acid-glands in case their charge shows overt disloyalty.
15|solve disputes among themselves with duels, and drill daily with various weapons and fighting styles.
16|is held within a hollow pyramid, with this staristocrat at the top point and many stairs and levels filtering petitioners between them and the entrance at the base.
17|is largely taken over by a conspiracy to poison this staristocrat, and even the uninvolved have begun to circle like vultures.
18|is a ring of stone thrones built to scale with the renown of the one who sits upon them - this staristocrat themself sits like a small child on a throne fit for giants - their seneschal on a stool.
19|is held around a colosseum, where gladiators and vicious alien beasts fight for their amusement and haruspexies.
20|is itinerant, a grand airship which hovers above the realms of hosting vavasours.

D20|This staristocrat's noble flaw 
:--|:--
1|is hubris - they believe they can become like God by funding breakneck scientific process.
2|is bravery - they will fight to the last in the face of overwhelming odds, even if better options present themselves.
3|is honour - their thinking is rigid and totally un-utilitarian.
4|is generousity - they give without thinking, disrupting economies and fostering dependence with their largesse.
5|is parental love - they spoil their children on a terrible, cosmic scale.
6|is a thirst for justice - a continent has burned due to their need for a punishment fitting a truly awful crime.
7|is filial piety - their increasingly-senile dowager-mother has them tied around her bony finger.
8|is tolerance - they've cultivated cosmopolitan communities, yet failed to confront division and rising extremism.
9|is an aesthetic sense that is souring into decadence.
10|is persistence - they are a dogged obsessive.
11|is realpolitik - they've alienated possible allies with ruthlessness.
12|is faith - they lean often into outright zealotry.
13|is cautiousness - they often dive into outright paranoia.
14|is competitiveness - they're innovative, but often only in the tortures applied to defeated rivals.
15|is cleanliness - they have advanced to a purgative germaphobia.
16|is contentment - they have come to peace with all things, even if others demand their action.
17|is honesty - they will never lie, even if it benefits them and their people.
18|is is humility - they are overly-convinced of their own incapacity.
19|is romantic love - their spouse manipulates them to their knowledge yet total acquiescence.
20|is imagination - their fancies often end up unproductive or outright destructive.",15 May 2024 22:45:39,reddit

626,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Still_Ad_4928/comments/1csv6m9/of_hearts_and_women_partii_booksample/,Of Hearts and Women Part-II (Book-Sample),"*Not shared, nor my shade; but something to be weaved; just as the measure of disappointment became it's own solution. But I talked my way through things forbidden, just to find myself blind in bed with those who are dead. Clumsy, but altogether natural of course, because it's consciousness what you refer in the description, yet that's what we don't get a lot about. See your deeds the way you are seen, and then return to a restless place: and the question in-between sheets will be why. Well, I just can't motivate myself to work without hot bitches staring. And that's the truth. Sad but True*

**‚Äî Hearfelt comment for an instagram witch.**

*Del desprecio a ese descarte, no he visto muchas cosas. As√≠ se pasa una m√°s para las cuentas, y aqu√≠ otro m√°s para los versos, por qu√© aqu√≠ no hemos sido vistos. Cu√°nto m√°s querr√≠a uno, que sino lo cuentas ni mucho menos piensas: << lo de este pibe que cosa m√°s horrible>>, haciendo eso lamentable, por qu√© en decirlo nadie ha mentido. ¬°Es horrible! Que cara es entonces la cuenta de lo que le sale a uno vivir sin m√°s complejos; mejor seria cobrarmelo, para as√≠ saber que de algo ha valido. Bloqueame.*

**‚Äî Heartfelt comment for a random supermodel-to-be.**

**The Spirit of Fire**

*Flames begone, flames in spite: their warmth I felt - so I closed my fist until I could feel the warmth of my blood in my hand. And in dreams Fire came up to me and said: who am I? And I said unto him: you are bound to my bidding, thus your name misery will be. But fire wretched as he was, got closer and asked: and who are you?*

*And I said unto him that the blood of David ran through my veins, as I was his heir; for the mother of God claim me from death as a son. So Fire tried me, and figured it out.*

*You are son of woman ‚Äîsaid Fire unto me‚Äî but as Fire acknowledged the name, I extended my left hand, and took Fire by the neck throwing him into the gound. ‚Äî You are going to lace yourself to the right hand of the beast, and you'll keep him steady, so I can cleanly take him down. And Fire stayed down, and with his forehead kissing the ground asked unto me ‚Äîwhy would the heir of David do so to earthly man?*

*And I said unto Fire that the beast from the abyss had left no mother for God, so I was to leave none of his body left for his head; as I was going to make it bleed until the end of the end of times.*

**The Spirit of Earth**

*Shapeless and without body, but keen within her many numbers, Earth came up to me in dreams, and said: who am I? And posessed in spirit as I was, I said unto her, that God had made her maiden again, and that she shall become the coins that Judas never received, which were to become the due payment of man and women for the body of Christ. Then I extended my right hand, and grabbed Earth by her hair ‚Äîwhich descended deep into the abysses of hell‚Äî and cut it short so the demons of Lilith would no longer had her gripped by her back.*

*You are now a woman, and I'm going to rise you from the grounds. You'll lace yourself to the left hand of the beast, and keep it steady so with one shot I can cleanly take him down.*

**The Spirit of Air**

*A dream shaped by written words, whispered down for years by the currents of this Montain, and it's requiem witnessed but by a few ‚Äî the end of dreams. But from where I standed at the peak, I called upon the distant currents that went down, and asked them: who am I?*

*And Air came unto me as bird, which had thousands of letters for feathers, and in the tongue of dead men answered.*

*""Somebody who only a few will remember by strange deeds; as the burden on your back, is a past tainted by impossible dreams. You were a lunatic giving new names to folk, and folk never bothered to remember ‚Äîso your name must be freak, as you died in a forgotten shack some short time ago.""*

*And as Air said these things upon me, I called Misery ‚Äîas I had dubbed Fire ‚Äî and told him to get inside my shot. The burden as Air had said, became lesser as i took the shot from my quiver. And I said upon Misery; that he was to set ablaze this arrow, as I was taking down the bird of Britain, and that I would do so, so God would give the deeds of Earth some better names.*

*The Lord is making a bridge between the empire of strength, and the last empire of men. Now by God's grace, I'm making the tongue of free men, the tongue of Spain. You will be eventually bound to my bidding, and if not me, it will be to the one I'm preceding; for I'm giving you twenty years to attone your wrongdoing. Alas, now because of your wretchedness, my shot on earthly men won't be clean, for his left leg won't stay steady.*

*Your old name was apathy, now I'm calling you Cisma, which in the tongue of dead men means schism. So now by the will of God lay unto the ground and say the words you've been teached. And as the arrow blazed forward, it's bending motion pierced the veil hiding the secret ladder of men. The bird of Britain catched on Fire, and it's hollering resounded throught the ladders of the mountain until the depths of the abyss. A column of air turned into fire, then violenty erupted from the vowels of the bird, and the wild fire spread as a storm from west to east all throughout the five kingdoms of men away from its own fiery wings, with a gift of misery and a few words to say.*

*""The name of your woman or the name of your man, will no longer explain their purpose to a man, a woman, or God. Charred words written by thunder will now be the new ladder of men ‚Äî but until then, darkness upon thee.""*

**The House of Water**

*I head into the coasts, and the beautiful beaches in-between, to find the stranger who burns images in the skin of men. He is the stranger, and has adopted the body of a monster, and he is one who cannot be understood, so he went on to only go out home in stunts, for the burdens in his heart have become too great to bear. Through terrible pains he has given all he once was for an identity, and as I pick up on his past, i found familiarity in the feelings of his heart. Oh dear friend how we found looking in sadness to ourselves, after doing same but with different means, carrying into our shoulders the loneliness of this world. As you have in-skin the garments of the strange doctrine that I preach ‚Äî I shall congrate you, for you truly have fought the world entire, for my doctrine is the words of those who shall defeat the world entire.*

*I may not have your strangeness in-body, but I have it in these words, and in the true feelings of my heart. And I say in admiration that there's no higher form of art, philosophy or religion: than those who perform the highest thing they can give a name about.*

*Now even within solitude, and at odds with what old dead men call God, I see you and I found strength in you, as I can see you are within me, and in that, you are within everything as it should be - as is meant in everyone who does something that touches the heart of another man. I call this the kingdom of God. Yet blind men and women will wonder how can the kingdom of God possibly be within two outcasts such as you and me.*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

Upong giving my regards and waiting for response, I found my way into a bench. It was a warm afternoon, and the wind carried the water of the sea. The bird of Britain came about down from the wind of north, and layed on the bench were I was sitting.

The bird asked: *why hast thou become this?*

And I said back to bird, scorched he was and nearing death, that it was me someone who was supposed to give names, yet for years I couldn't figure out one for myself. Then on went to being given a name, Alas all the wrong ones. *Did Adan gave himself a name?* - I asked the bird back. And there was no response from bird. Then I continued.

A man has the essence of his soul retained by what he is seen doing. Yet I did things nobody saw, so my soul wasn't with God but with something just as ancient, and nonetheless unknown by men in its true nature ‚Äî then Satan as the better known devil, came about and pushed me into a hole. It was my own doing. Yet the things I did, I thought were seen. But nonetheless what I did was without contemplation on a posible return. Just as somebody who prints an image on their own skin. It's permanent. This is the essence of a memory in the soul of the man who's seen by others. But in the familiarity of a man who picked every irreversible decision like the Alien, I find myself feeling sympathy, for the man is still not what he has been seen doing, he shall redeem himself by what he decides to turn himself into.

*Is this a way of saying that you want to get yourself a tattoo? Get a new look?* - the bird mockingly asked.

And I gave the scorched bird no answer.

Then the bird said unto me: *what about your career as a prophet, uh? And the things you said about returning with substance? Do you actually think this is substance?*

And i considered what the Bird said, then I negated with a movement of my own head. It is not i answered, but i find the memories of me not making sense unbearable. For those mean the memories of a fool, un pendejo, an insane person, or both. And I will always try to amend what I don't do well. But now I wish for only one thing, and it is to be remembered as someone who makes sense, and who out of that sense, made good upon the world. I don't expect anything in return for what I do now, as it is merely an outlet to keep me sane while I finish editing my work. It's clear I'm too incompetent to be a competent influencer. As for once, I don't care about influencing anyone into what I think; but to perform what I think it's important.

Then every proverbial student is free to take classes so as they see fit, and to interpret such classes as their comprehension gives them grasp of what it's said. In such regard, this is what I offer now, while I make the journey to Madrid. And the bird tilted it's head so as to observe me with his left eye, then after a long impasse, it made a loud and painful caw, and finally flew away. Soon after the bird flew, I looked upon the stars in the nascent night, and confessed to them, that it was the memories of who we were, what often stumps us into wrong beliefs of who we should be, maybe even wasting an entire lifetime retained by that which other people remembered us as being. But we are not the owners of our own names, the place we go, and our destiny. That's the biggest lie the western world of hollywood heros tell you, as in truth is collective agreement what determines what we look like doing and thus the meaning we should comfort to, recalling that names are practical mechanisms to remember the purpose of things, their meaning, and how their motion is described in the world.

But making the task of beating that collective belief, akin to the Nietzschean ideal of the camel turning into the lion, so as to transform it's spirit and become something else. But if it's the golden dragon of all the huamn values which judges you insane, will you be prepared to wrestle with the entire culture so as to have your way?

As I layed my eyes upon each star counting up to the number seventeen, I confessed of being scared of those beliefs, as revisiting the past, became a painful deed ‚Äî and as I prepared to leave, I uttered one wish on the seventeenth point in the sky.

*Lord please grant me strength, the way you have given my friend strenght.*

2.

*The night deepen, while the sea tide sang its own song of breathing. Some time passed, and then on the stranger showed himself approaching at the distance. I waved my hand at him, and after the instant, he found his way into my bench while I welcomed him with an extended fist which he casually bumped - after the short acknowledgement the dark alien looked at my face in between it's cover of dark, and looking at it undiscernable in its true features, with suspicion asked.*

‚Äî What is it that you want?

I acknowledged him as a friend, then mentioned my brief research, as I had come to know him as man looking for a job, yet nobody would hire for things mundane due to his appearance. I listened closely to the news, and came to understand that this was a man looking for a second chance.Then I saw the intent behind his doing, and two words came to stick to my own thoughts. The first one was <<evolution>> and the second one was <<mind>>. I was admired.

In analytical psychology I figured this man was the ESFP ‚Äîthe personality archetype related to the performer and the entertainer‚Äî, possessed in an abnormal way by the spirit by which a person submits to it's contrary nature, seeking to integrate and find fulfillment through the chase of what's perceived absent. If he was the ESFP then doing the flip by following the radial axis of each Jungian function in the stack towards their opposite resulted in the INTJ. The mastermind. The architect. The genius yet awfully complex individual. That was the elusive spirit he was chasing.

But a spirit and a character that at its most pronounced embodiment in a person, would experience life as an eternal foreigner hiding from the light of other men. Such made sense to me, for I myself was the INTJ, and had at spirit the ESFP. Him. So where as this man chased the spiritual fulfillment of being a complex and deep individual, I chased the fulfillment of becoming simpler, so I could demonstrate with action the deepest desires of my heart. One who was born plentiful in means to be liked, becomes complex, mysterious and uncomprehended, meeting one who will be seen trying to make sense becoming simpler. For Carl Jung portrayed the anima and animus of individuals, as the sense of what its absent, yet deeply cherished an valued. So I said these things to the alien, while he silently listened to me.

‚Äî All of that sounds like bullshit to me. -Said the alien after some contemplation .‚Äî Sorry but the things you say, don't mean anything to me.

And alas for I expected such response, as if one thing was true about this journey, was that explaining the journey in and of itself would become it's grimmest task. I affirmated what he just said with a slight nod of head.

‚Äî These things I say and how they relate to each other, in its excercise are similar to doing stecheometric balance with equations in the head, but simpler I'm afraid. - Then I paused, looked back into the sea, and continued. ‚Äî That's high school chemistry, but I don't expect everybody to pick up on it, nor like it, nor understand it.

‚Äî Now i have called you a friend, and where I came from we dub with this title the people we share destiny with. As far as I'm concerned, we are chasing the same thing, which is the hardest posible thing. We both innately understand that we are not home, as we want our spirit to return to us, and that's not what a lot of people ever honestly try to attempt in a lifetime; as such is anyone's call to feel complete.¬†

‚Äî And very few people ever reach true individuality, beyond the name they are imposed at birth.

*Then I looked into the black alien, and in-between his foreign facial features, I interpreted something familiar. Disturbance. And I continued.*

‚Äî We have given ourselves hell as we lived chasing something hard, so we can avoid the same hell later on when we are finally back to our own house. This is a christian precept, altought a rundimentary one. Does that makes sense to you?

*And after listening such, the black alien calmly looked at the veil in my face in silence. Trying to discern what my face actually looked like, but the night was dark. Then turned his stare back to the reflection of the moon over the waters, giving some thought to what I just said. I opened up my backpack, and drawed two cans of beer from it. Offered one to him, and he silently refused with a gesture of hand. I popped my can and gave it a sip, while I myself stared at the tides coming in and out of the shore.*

‚Äî If you wan't a tattoo, we can work that out. But this sounds annoyingly familiar, and my interest is not religious. Are you religious?

I nodded in affirmation, and complemented saying. ‚Äî But my doctrine is something nobody has heard nor seen. For its aim, is doing as Christ said, in perfect means. Yet its true that the teaching fits you, as it's the teaching of the future man; and there's nothing in common between the current man and the future man, as they may very well be different species. This is the precept of evolution.

*The alien seemed surprised.*

‚Äî These two men don't know each other, for the current man doesn't know where the future man comes from, for he himself doesn't know where he is going. Yet in deep realization of your own artistic concept, I think you might want new ideas to meet with your appearance. So tell me, are you curious about what truly happens to a man after he dies? Do you want to learn how to read someone's mind? Do you want to blast with words of fire the hearts of an amazed crowd?

*But the black alien broke his calm contemplation of what I was saying, and slighty disturbed, aggressively rebuked after hearing such.*

‚Äî But you mentioned 'Christ', so you must be christian. How can a christian even say anything interesting in this current time? Last time I asked, their sayings were dreaded by restriction - so why would anyone condemn themselves to a life of bore? Are you a christian?

And I nodded after the question, in silence. Admittedly, for I knew what the problem was with being what I was, and my new companion was bang on identifying it. Made a pause, then raised my sight to where it met with the sky and the stars in it, and I said back to him.

‚Äî I am, but not one of a type you have ever seen, for the Christ that comes, is a Christ of art.

2.

*The riptide sang, in its secret dialect of earth and sea. I looked upon the coast, turned an eye blind, and saw the ocean as the scorpio, and the land as the taurus; as it was the struggle between two lovers, never meant to consume each other. Ideal love then - yet not to confuse with this partnership as it was whimsilcally tied by the means in which i arranged my current conversation; for my lady somewhere waited for me. Then i allowed my eyes to rest still.*

The alien looked upon me, undiscernable in my intentions, and again figured for himself that my interest towards him wasn‚Äôt clear. In suspicion, and after the moment he collected his thoughts asked ‚ÄúIn your weird words you dubbed me *performer*, so what is it exactly that you wan‚Äôt from me. To me it seems like you are gathering people for some form of religious clown show. When you forced this meeting upon me, was this a proposal you thought i would find amusement in?‚Äù. And after the statement my own stare wandered in my conversation partner. While as he had his say, i returned to my can of beer, and finished it with a long gulp. Tempered in an unwillingness to fall to my new found friend irritation, i said within my own thoughts: ‚ÄúThe alien looks easy going, but he is barbed in wit‚Äù.¬†

*Then i opened the can of beer that the stranger rejected; the loud pop resounded in the relative silence, interrupting for a moment the steady chorus of the sea. Gave it a long sip, and said.*

‚Äì Theres no proposal in place yet. But im certain of something, and that is that both of us are messed individuals which reached the bottom doing the same thing - but the way my understandment of the human soul goes: two people can act by mere interaction as reactives to each other, creating a new chemical compound after the fact.

‚Äì This new psychology is very much like chemistry. But it is not my intention to draw you into something, but to pull myself out of this ¬´something¬ª by doing right on another person and maybe that person reflecting the good back on me. I just need a conversation partner, thats all. And i will do this with you, and with many people more. Presidents included.

The alien reflected on it, and after the hiatus of a long standing position of suspicion he finally gave in, and eased up with a slight smile. A strange smile of relief. But the smile, was all too familiar for me, as i realized the man was a tortured individual: a person in long standing pain. I smiled back the way he did, and continued.

‚Äì Our pain has a common name, and is a name that can be written with words unfortunately. It‚Äôs the devilish mother of all spiritual ills and its foundation, rests at the concept of a past that wasnt solved. It‚Äôs called ¬´inadequeacy¬ª, and for people like you and me, understanding one day that such inadecuacy had to be solved by our own means, lead us into an act where our name changed as the changes in our cover up act to solve our inadequacy did.

‚Äì We never honored the past or the present in our pursuit, as we desired in passion to find solution to the present, by matching it into the idealization of some future without ever realizing that the old or present essence of ones being would be crushed into non existance by said future.

‚Äì Then we found the realization of that new name, only to understand that its demands became a tyranny on the other faces of our soul: as our soul is not something that can be undestood in unity, but something that conceives in the beginning in multiple things which try to give shape to one thing. Theres many people in a village, and our minds, are no exception.

‚Äî But happiness is only achieved by those who have their soul entire - or those who are the same person regardless of the context and scenario. And we gave to much to somebody that wasn't us, as our spirit took possession and lead us down.

‚Äì This is this the essence by which someone goes to hell, only to do one thing over again, getting an ever lasting pain for all the things that were given up chasing that which was absent. The more someone is forced into being shaped by the thing that was concevied in lust, the more the individual misses the place they used to call home, for that is no longer within ones reach. Does this makes sense to you?

*The alien left me with no answer, and as he contemplated the sea, a tear travelled through his strange face.*

‚Äì In this state of anguish, affliction rarely ever feels company, as the very individual condition that was pursued, became a full suit and persona to be forced upon and wear. Hell, is one lonely place man because we only learn to speak a language, that only makes sense to ourselves. But i think we can find a way out of it. This is why I'm here.

‚ÄúLook, what you‚Äôve done, it‚Äôs not something i can see the way you can see my own doing on me.‚Äù The alien replied. ‚ÄúBesides the way in which i canno‚Äôt see your face in this night, you seem ordinary ‚Äî but what you talk and the way you say it, evokes in every word regret. What is it that you‚Äôve done that has you regret like this?‚Äù

*As the alien finished speaking, I emptied the can of beer, layed my eyes on the irregular grooves that my feet had left on the sand, and then replied back to him, after making a recap of the story i had repeatedly told myself after falling down.*

‚ÄúMy story, is the fairy tale of a guy who makes way for the new coming of a new man; a better man for the world, while he casts disarray upon the earth: much to his dismay, at the expense of his own soul as the people who become victims of disasters, were ones who this man deemed unfair; cruel, evil, despicable in past. That was at the beginning.""

""Theres a pile of corpses behind that character ‚Äî even in covid time, people as close as the local priest of the small town he lived in, would break their neck after falling in the shower, as he had the slightest suspicion of their secret deeds. All clean deads for that matter. Untraceable to nothing but sheer randomness. Magic as it seeems. But were this folk truly evil people or even guilty of anything? You may ask - the man never knew it for sure, as he never had faculties such as godly omniscience to actually know it; which has taken a toll on him, as the burden of justice is an unberable one for anything but a god.""

""Which leads to another point: spontaneously picturing random numbers in the head, associating them with psychological compounds by angular momentum, and actually being bang on the suspicion. Truth friend, in its stochastic presentation: it's unberable.‚Äù

‚ÄúConsequential of such attempts to rationalize his own story in the eyes of people such as close family, my dude became clinically diagnosed with referenced thinking. Which are fancy words for schizophrenia. Nobody believed the story as it was uttered.""

""Yet the consequences are there for everyone to see, altought not visible in their cause and effect by anybody but this guy, which lead him first into regret over ever starting his quest as a reformer; and then repent.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow before he realized of this lets call it ¬´curse¬ª, he preached for years over the internet as the disasters started to slowly creep up. He preached in a fashion parallel to Niestzches Zarathustra; Zarathustra meaning a famous philosophical device artificied by the philosopher Niestzche, who‚Äôs aim was to portray the best posible man, as something he dubbed the <<√úbermensch>> ‚Äù.

‚ÄúSuch concept being the seemingly more elegant brand of a humanist ideal for a not so distant future: today - albeit a wrong one, for this guy was not dyonisian himself. The backbone of his framework, is analytical psycholgy becoming a chariot for a true understandment of human nature: and ultimately a facilitator for love within light: not within ignorance; not within darkness. Most philosophers today though would mock anything analytical in it's aim.""

""Then on the guy preached and dwelved further into the relative hole of his own doctrine: and became imprisoned by what he didn‚Äôt got right at first attempt, making him in the process the character that Nietzsche from the comfort of his own writers seat, never attempted to actually embody within realistic means: eventually figuring out within himself the ultimate Nietzschean aristocrat: a magic pen granted by being capetian by mother: from judah by father.""

""But Alas, you have no idea how common suicide is within philosophers after they finish their best work. As language, becomes the ultimate barrier for understandment, and then to ones capacity to feel love. Difference ‚Äî true saliency in ones individual destiny‚Äî leads to the gravest posible pain. Ironic isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBesides technical work with a new form of psychology inspired by analytical chemistry, as that drawed from his efforts during the light of day, five years ago, once he felt the urge to try to reach out to the world from a position of what he deemed was greater understandment: he primitively preached during night his new set of ideas for people to behave beyond the limitations of manipulative psychology, albeit a harsh doctrine meant to clear the way for a better product: Christ himself.""

""This is not a doctrine a human being can actually perform, as such its christianity at its highest capacity to bear fruit. It‚Äôs an impossible doctrine, yet solves the oldest problem posed in the bible. All which sounds very sci-fi bullshit-y but actual problems started for the protagonist in this tale, when the preaching matched with terrible consequences. Not figurative, but within tangible reality.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo just as we talk, theres a small legion of hackers pretending to be doing internet social experiments while talking in an artsy matter: much in my own style, entertaining the exact same concepts - a legion of dangerous monkeys, i have no control over.""

""One of the many unexpected consequences being this, yet prompted by something evil; ancient: essentially replicating what my protagonist developed and then preached over the years, while these ""hacktivists"" lay their attention on things and people, as they select them and enforce upon them strict surveillance, to behave properly. Then to destroy them, as they did in 2020 with many corporations and institutions.A bizarre combination of theater actors to my own liking, and then cyber-security demigods: omniscient in their claims to surveill, and they are - derivative such of another device of what I've done; which is to build a theater so people can make-believe that they are infact performing within themselves something greater - but that's matter for another story.""

‚ÄúMost of the corpses piling up flat out dead, have no relation to him whatsoever; they became victims as my protagonist took measures to fight back the monster he found at the foundation of the known world. This is not an elaborate analogy for one's own unseen capacity for evil, as i mean this: a monster as literally as it can be. For these things friend, im doomed as in true strenght, i have nothing but the pen i use to write down what i think albeit always at danger of it‚Äôs eventual inversion. I have no real friends left. Not one who can understand, or help bear the pain: as friendship and love are all gated by understandment.""

""The full story has many more vertients, but i think i‚Äôve done it enough justice. This is the predicament of an insane man chased by his own shadow as he builds a better man: one who delivers heavenly things, and then a shadow stringed to deliver tyranny as the very strings behind him make the better man stumble while he tries to keep a grasp of his own spirit, and then of his own soul.""

""That monster behind, is wicked smart ‚Äî and cannot be outwitted nor overpowered but anything but divine smite.""

‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading now to a new country, to try to get friends from the only institution in the world who knows and adresses the current times being, and who by extension, might believe me. And to clarify, these being the end of times; but not the end of the world. Yet now i myself have a damocles sword pending over my own head, and i need to do something about it before it falls.‚Äù

*And as i said these things, i reached out to my backpack drawing a third can of beer from it ‚Äî besides my own super laptop, thats what my backpack had: an infinite supply of beer. Corona, Indio, Victoria, Dos Equis, Heineken; you name it. I popped the can, and gave it a long and definite sip as i emptied it complete.*

The alien didn't try to show that he understood, but stood still in silence, with his sight in the sand below and pressing lips, knowing by my demeanor; that these things as I've said them was something that I needed to do. Then he said: ""I don't follow man. You say you preach and then disasters occur. Like a prophet from the bible?""

""Yes. Then I preached to get rid of the things that are actually making the world worse, and something awoke soon after, and since then; everything I do is subject to being misinterpreted due to the diffamatory action of this thing. Now everytime I do something, it can be twisted and turned against my original intent. Right now the hackers are my worst problem: I may have a degree in computers but I have no fucking idea whatsoever of hacking. I earn my living as an A.I engineer."".

The alien raised his sight to meet with mine, and after doing some contemplation on the fact, quite simply said: ""You are insane"". Then lowered his own sight, and raised it again to meet with the sea and continued. ""If you want a tattoo, we can work that out. But either way and whatever parts of your story are true and even worse; the ones you may be lying about: you sound dangerous in a delusional kind of sense, and my life is hard enough as is.""

I pressed my fists, knowing then the old same thing had happened again. For I had never forced anything upon anybody, and I was willing to respect that until the bitter end. Then I released the build up of frustration with a loud sigh, and after this amend, I replied back.

""I understand and respect it. But let me just propose you that if you ever want to figure what is beyond life as it's lived by person who has never seen what is like to be someone you write a great story about; you can pin me, and I'll show you what's beyond that door. Give it some thought.""

The alien; The Black Alien Project stayed there sitting, spechless but calm, almost expecting something else to be convinced about. But pointless, for i knew that nobody can be forced into anything without bringing a transgression into play ‚Äì and i wasn‚Äôt one to taint myself in sin if it could be avoided. Not anymore.

3.

I made the distance at steady pace walking along the shore, until i found a small group of pines in-between the liminal space of the beach and the land. I sat with one of the pines trunk behind my back, and drawed the Schizo Pills from my eternal supply of traveller goodies.

Quetiapine 100 mg, and Olanzapine 10 mg, i made a smaller fragment from the olanzapine pill, and swallowed both complete. As their side effects were concerned, they would soon knock me out of conscience, as this little ritual was my own way of calling the day complete ‚Äì then i layed there, vigilant, waiting for my own drowsiness to claim me into sleep - but the Bird of Britan came flying from above, and stood besides me.

*\*Chirp, Chirp, Chirp\**

I watched the bird, annoyed, as its presence had become an omen for contempt. For me and the death people of my past. I frowned upon the little shit, and said nothing. The bird made a little nod, while tilting its head in excentricity the way birds do, and replied. ‚Äî Hey Andrew!, do you remember when you tried to penetrate your own computer to make a universe grow inside of it? I just wan‚Äôt to know something: did your computer moan? Did it finally learnt how to scream your name?

*\*Chirp Chirp\**

*Ignoring the bird, i closed my eyes and stayed like that for a long moment, hoping to make the bird think i was asleep. Maybe that would make him leave.*

‚Äî Can‚Äôt bullshit me like that Sweetheart. So please tell me something; why don‚Äôt you command one of your supermodels; these muses, to come here and warm the bed for you. It's a cold night and you seem lonely *brah*

. *\*Chirp Chirp\**

I opened my eyes, and irritated, pointed menacingly at the bird turning my left hand into an imaginary gun. I had already failed at something today, and wasn‚Äôt convinced i needed the memory of the things i failed at before. Not now.

* Hol‚Äô up cowboy ! you wan‚Äôt to bang my bird ass when you should be banging a bitch ass. What happened with Tyrone huckleberry? Did you managed to make him as impotent as you are right now? ‚ÄîI held steady my hand; and tired, the tempation to pull again the trigger on the bird was growing larger. I saw red roses in my own sight, making a terrible omen for a migraine forthcoming. Said nothing.

‚Äî The glowniggers are out there brah. You may not be a hacker ‚Äì and its true, but i took notice of your last words: so now the glowies are going to instead dreambooth\* people into every posible kind of scenario of extorsion, while they surveil like a motherfucker. Like you dream boothed yourself for your little ahem ""art project"". Then we will use Suno\*, then Sora\* when it open sources. Are you going to protect your hoes?

*Said nothing.*

* Alright cowboy, i will give meaning to that revelations verse. What was it? Ah yes. Revelations 9:6. Every single person with an internet history will be as paranoid as you were in 2020. Everyone will be diffamated into acts of political terrorism! Aren‚Äôt you am-

*And as i pulled the imaginary trigger from the imaginary pistol, an imaginary arrow in the sky descended with a blaze of not so imaginary flames on the Bird of Britain, engulfing the little shit in heat, and making it‚Äôs body explode into a gore of scorched viscera. As if the bird was in a microwave oven. I inmediately gasped as the explosion was too close from where i was sitting - after the conmotion, stared at the red and burned stain in the floor, and left my sight rest there, as sleep finally found its way into my restless thoughts.*

""No longer care for love unless it's between good friends‚Äù. Said to myself. There was certainly a migraine coming, but maybe my dreams would help convince it otherwise. And as far as the hoes were concerned, Furious Angels would be there for them. Like the Rob Dougan song.

4.

Found my own mind after the slumber ‚Äì asleep, then awake. I realized several hours passed - at least enough to wake up and witness the sun rise above the sea. But as for dreams, the light veil of their memories wasn't something to rely upon. But i did remember something, and it was some overtone in dread; an atmosphere of fear ‚Äì and a kind of dread sustained in it‚Äôs inevitability by the urgency that builds upon dearth.

Now what exactly was it though? I couldn‚Äôt remember from my dreams, but ever since i falled to my own death i had always present in mind the future succesion of events that would follow when things started to go very wrong. Iran, the U.S, Israel - now whatever was it in the news; the outcome would be the same. A thousand more cuts to an already languishing economy. Make that corpse bleed, and then fall off a cliff.

As such things would be cooked, just as the bird of britain. The bird was still there though: just in pieces and roasted like the contents of a dropped KFC bucket would. But the little shit would return - as it always did. The economy? Not so much.

Yet i digress. None of the world circumstances mattered as far i was concerned ‚Äì i had built a small and portable solar system to power my laptop, and my beer supply was well, infinite - i made myself sure that i had my needs covered whatever happened around me. Not tied to even a house for that matter. I incorporated myself and gave my back a stretch. The morning breeze coming from the sea evocated in my memories some time that had long passed ‚Äì late childhood. I rejected those memories as they beared with them things i didnt wan‚Äôt to remember - then wen‚Äôt on as usual in my morning routine scrolling through my instagram feed, figuring if there were any new hoes to maybe motivate me into doing my God imposed labour.

Labour which was to either write, or to finish the House of Water ‚Äî then after scrolling i did in fact saw a new hoe; i dropped a Faux Pas comment. Maybe she would play along, maybe not. Whatever. Sometimes I would put in a lot of effort to do a rhyme. But the effort depended on the insta-hoe in question. *I know*. Not the best of habits, but back in elementary school i was the kind of kid that would only get motivation when the girls in the classroom were present in physEd. And then i would run faster: whole lotta faster. *Run Forrest! Run!* Women love used to fuel me; and the habit sticked ‚Äî and at the moment, i was kinda done with the idea of female trascendence. Would rely on their love, but not on their validation. Not like a simp. Fuck that.

Furthermore, what results did i demonstrably mustered after pursuing true egalitarianism and sharing it? *Exactly*. A bitch gonna do what a bitch gonna do, and so does the human female. After publishing the comment, I locked my phone and walked towards the highway, as i was planning to pay a visit to somebody long forgotten - I had kind of a schedule that i was going to follow, before taking the plane to Madrid and become hispanic Jon Snow from the walgreens Nightwatch.",15 May 2024 16:39:46,reddit

628,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1cste8n/my_friend_disappeared_on_the_beach_last_night_im/,"My Friend Disappeared on the Beach Last Night, I'm the Only one Who Knows Where she Went","This is the story of the death of my friend Marcy. I still don‚Äôt know why this happened to her and no one believes me so I‚Äôm posting here. Hopefully this will give me clarity, but to be very honest I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs possible. 

Me and my friend had spent a long relaxing day at the beach and by this time many of the other beach goers had packed up and left. For a couple hours we had the beach all to ourselves.



 My friend‚Äôs hands slipped under the wet sand, emerging with handfuls that fell in clumps. She gazed at the horizon and leaned forward into the light breeze that pulled the heat off of our cheeks.



 ‚ÄúWell, we‚Äôre both sunburnt to hell, so we should probably head home‚Äù I said, twirling a shell in my hand before setting it down beside me. 



 She looked at me with a frown, but rose to her feet and offered me her hand. I took it, wobbling to my feet, my legs still asleep from the time spent sitting. The beach was still hot, but there was no point in filling our shoes with sand, so we just kept to the cool wet sand near the water. My friend stared at the sun as we went, as it was inching closer to the horizon. She stared, almost locked onto it. 



Then she tripped and fell face first on a sand mound, eating dirt.



 ‚ÄúUgh‚Äù 



She spattered out the sand that had filled her mouth. Giggling, I pulled her from the ground. 



‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù



 ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù  I asked, still stifling a laugh 



‚ÄúThere was something in the sky‚Ä¶‚Äù 



 ‚ÄúWell, All *I* saw is that you face planted.‚Äù I said smiling in satisfaction



 ‚ÄúI'm serious, there was something? I don‚Äôt know what‚Ä¶‚Äù she trailed off as she looked back at the sky.



 ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs gone now, nevermind.‚Äù 

she turned, marching forward, shoving her hands into her pockets as she went.



 I glanced back, scanning the waves, nothing but blue stretched in front of me. The tide was rising though, so I raced to catch up with her.  I knew it was a long walk back, but in the waning light the walk seemed unending. It wasn‚Äôt even that hot but I was sweating profusely, and I was unsteady in the shifting sand. I started feeling dizzy, the sand glimmering in front of me. The intense sunburn was getting to me. I gazed down at my feet, taking every step with ample precaution. I was so focused on not falling over that I didn‚Äôt notice my friend had completely disappeared. I could only assume she was playing a prank on me. 



 ‚ÄúMarccyyy!‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda dizzy, can we not do this now!‚Äù



 no answer.



 A tinge of frustration rose inside me,



‚ÄùMarcy, can we please just get to the car!‚Äù



 More silence, followed by the crash of waves. I rubbed my hands together in worry and cracked my knuckles.



‚ÄùWhere the hell are you?‚Äù I muttered, glancing anxiously across the beach.



 It was entirely empty. My breath whistled in and out in panic and I closed my eyes. I had to control my breathing,



 1, 2, 3, 4, breathe in,



 5, 6, 7, 8, breathe out. 



I opened my eyes. Walking out past a cluster of bushes I scanned for Marcy‚Äôs bright carrot hair. There it was, shifting behind a mound of sand.



 ‚ÄúMarcy! Shit you scared me!‚Äù



 I tumbled up the hill, still amused despite the mild panic. Only to find her buried in the sand. Her face was only a few inches above the surface. Her eyes pleading but her mouth was sealed shut. 



‚ÄúOmg, Marcy what happened?‚Äù



 ‚ÄúPlease get me out‚Äù she pleaded, bits of sand tumbling into her mouth. 



She spat and promptly shut it, sand danced around her nostrils, moved by her shaky breath. I kneeled down and pulled the sand away from her face, wincing as it scraped my knees.



 ‚ÄúJesus, Marcy, how‚Äôd you bury yourself like this?‚Äù



 She only whimpered, closing her eyes and shaking her head slightly. I removed as much sand from around her face as I could before I started digging for her arms. I shoveled deep into the sand where her left arm would be, only to find there was nothing underneath. 



Nothing but more sand, sand that was warm, even hot. 

Marcy wasn't buried in the sand laying down, she was standing. Her feet must have been five feet deep by that point.

Marcy garbled out a yell, my gaze shifted locking with hers, as her face sunk even deeper into the sand. I scrambled, pulling sand away from her face as fast as I could. But she just kept sinking, panicked whimpers from her closed lips being deadened by the shifting sand. In less than a second her face was completely covered. The dust flying up with the last of her short exhales. My hands flew over the area flinging piles and piles of sand from the place where she disappeared. I uncovered strands of fire red hair, only for them to sink even deeper down. My heart leapt in and out of my chest, sand stung in my eyes and buried into my cuticles. It burned like fire but I couldn't stop.  I was digging like an animal, sweating and hyperventilating.  

The sand was getting hotter, the sun was undoubtedly setting, but the sand was getting hotter.  I stood up to see my knees and hands badly burned. Covered in leaking pustules and even a little bit of blood. Why was the sand so goddamn hot?! I stumbled back a few feet, landing on cool, soft sand. My body buckled and I sunk into the ground. Tears welled in my eyes and my hands shook. It felt like an awful dream, and I just wanted to wake up. What was this beach?

 I stared at my friend's grave, A circle of sand still moving slightly where her head had been. Steam was rising faintly from the mound.

Marcy was certainly dead by now. 

My head was spinning, I had to get home, I had to scream for help, but I couldn't do anything. I closed my eyes feeling the cool of the sand under my body. It hurt to move. So. I didn‚Äôt.

I probably lay there, passed out, for hours before they found me.

I woke up in the hospital, burns on my arms and legs, not near as bad as I assumed the night before. Her parents were asking me questions, but I couldn‚Äôt answer any of them. God only knows what I‚Äôll tell the police. 

They said they hadn‚Äôt found her. I believed them. I can‚Äôt find any natural way to explain my friend sinking into the goddamn earth, but I do know one thing. She is likely never coming back.

630,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsReadOfficial/comments/1css43u/children_of_the_night_part_4/,Children of the Night (Part 4),"Club Vlad sat near the confluence of Central Avenue and Washington Avenue, Albany‚Äôs two main thoroughfares. Two stories with blackout windows and a box office from when it used to be a movie theater, it was swarmed with people when Dom first spotted it ahead. He was somewhat familiar with it: He passed it every day on his way to work, and it was always busy around his time of evening, even on weeknights. Part of him always wanted to go inside and be a part of the scene, but he never did.

The man in sunglasses - his name was Joe - led Dom toward the club, and even before Joe spoke, Dom somehow knew that it was their destination. ‚ÄúThere,‚Äù Joe said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go around back.‚Äù

Dom and Joe had been walking for what seemed like an hour but couldn‚Äôt have been more than fifteen minutes. Dom stuck as close to Joe as possible as if for protection, and had become accustomed to his pungent smell. It was noticeable only at extremely close range, part sickly sweet and part‚Ä¶something else, something Dom could not place but still somehow recognized. They were two blocks from the club, maybe three, and Dom could hear the pulsing techo/house/whatever music as clearly as if he were standing in the middle of the dancefloor. He could hear the chatter of the people inside, or at least he imagined he could. He could smell them too: Beneath the odors of perfume, desperation, and spiritual rot was something richer, something blissful. Dom realized for the first time that he was parched - so parched - and drool filled his mouth.

A crowd of people waited outside Club Vlad, talking and laughing; some vaped, some stared down at their cellphones like Gollum with his precious ring. Dom‚Äôs first reaction was to avoid them. Perhaps sensing this‚Ä¶or perhaps feeling it himself‚Ä¶Joe ducked into an alleyway two doors down from the club. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll go in the back,‚Äù Joe explained.

The back entrance to Club Vlad was a single door underneath a bare bulb. The music was so loud that Dom‚Äôs head began to throb. Inside, a dark hallway terminated in an archway filled with throbbing white light. Dread filled Dom as they approached it - he didn‚Äôt want to be around people - but thankfully they went into a room off the hall instead. An office. A cramped desk, a filing cabinet. A set of stairs disappeared into shadows.

‚ÄúSit,‚Äù Joe said.

Dom obeyed, sitting in the swivel chair.

Joe went up the stairs and Dom was alone. The deep coldness that had long settled into his bones made itself known again, and Dom leaned forward, wrapping his arms around his chest for warmth. The muffled music vibrated in his skull, setting his teeth on edge, and the various smells wafting in from the main room assaulted his senses. He was alternately repulsed and aroused by the crashing din of scents: The good, the bad, and the mouth watering. A sharp pain cut through his stomach like the killing edge of a knife, and Dom hugged himself tighter. Had his throat always been this dry? His throat felt like sandpaper; his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth and getting it unstuck hurt so badly that tears sprang to his eyes.

Dom rubbed his arms with his hands and tried to still his chattering teeth. He looked around for a blanket, a discarded jacket, something to cover himself with, but there was nothing. Only drifts of glitter on the floor and walls. He supposed it came from a party or something. He‚Äôd never been to a night club but it seemed fitting.

A sound drew his attention to the door leading back into the hall. A woman - no older than a girl - stood there, looking confused and unsteady. She was dressed in black, wore glow sticks around her wrists and neck, and held a red solo cup. ‚ÄúI have to pee,‚Äù she said drunkenly and laughed. ‚ÄúI thought this was the bathroom.‚Äù

A cold wind washed over Dom, and Joe was standing next to him. ‚ÄúThe bathroom‚Äôs up here,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúOh, good,‚Äù the girl laughed, ‚ÄúI thought it was here but I didn‚Äôt know. This is my first time here.‚Äù She held her cup aloft. ‚ÄúTake me to it.‚Äù

Joe glanced at Dom. ‚ÄúCome on.‚Äù

They formed a party as they climbed the stairs, Dom in the tear and Joe at the head. The girl stumbled and held onto the railing, talking incessantly. Her voice hurt Dom‚Äôs head, but the hot smell wafting from her was intoxicating. Drool coursed down his chin and his breathing came in short, hot bursts. Another sharp pain rent his stomach, and he winced.

At the top of the stairs, where the lights were cold and white, a woman in black stood by a doorway, her back ramrod straight and her eyes vacant. Her face was gaunt, her white flesh pulled tight across her skull. She wore a black dress and her black hair long and straight. Dom only caught a glance at her before looking away again.

She looked like a ghost.

‚ÄúShow her the bathroom,‚Äù Joe said.

The woman‚Äôs eyes slowly, ponderles, went from Joe to the drunk girl. Her expression, like Joe‚Äôs, was dead. She¬†*had*¬†no expression. ‚ÄúThis way.‚Äù

She and the drunk girl disappeared down the hall, and Joe led Dom into a room. Though it was pitch black, Dom could still see; not very well‚Ä¶but he could see. Suddenly, a blinding white light flicked on in front of him, causing him to stop and fall back a step. Ahead, through an archway, sat a vaulted chamber, at the center of which sat a man. To Dom‚Äôs light dazzled eyes, he seemed a proud king perched upon a throne, the skulls of his many enemies piled around him. Dom blinked and turned his head slightly to the side. His eyes began to adjust, and the world came into focus.

The man was not, as it had first seemed, sitting on a throne. Instead, he was esconded in a motorized wheelchair. The piles of skulls were actually various pieces of machinery, the kind you‚Äôd find in a hospital room. A clear tube extended from one of them to the side of the man‚Äôs neck: Yellow liquid flowed from the machine and into the man. Another tube, this one in the other side of his neck, filtered out a mixture of what looked like yellow pus and black sludge. An infected malodor filled the air, and the machines whirred softly as they worked.

As for the man himself, his appearance was normal at first glance, Dressed in a flowing red velvet robe, a blue and green blanket with a plaid pattern draped over his shoulders, he was portly, about fifty, and had shoulder length grayish hair with a bald spot in the middle. If the local theater put on a production of¬†*Hamilton*, they could cast a worse Ben Franklin than him.

On closer inspection, he was not normal at all. His complexion was yellow and waxy, like a statue, and his body was lumpy, misshapen, resembling an overfilled trash bag stuffed with cotton. His eyes were sick and yellow, and something about his posture seemed‚Ä¶off. It didn‚Äôt make sense, but the only thing Dom could think was:¬†*He looks impossible*.

Joe stopped at the edge of the shadows, where the line between light and darkness lay. He seemed to stand up a little straighter, a general greeting his king. ‚ÄúHere he is,‚Äù Joe said.

The man squinted slightly against the glare of the light and motioned with one gnarled hand. ‚ÄúStep into the light,‚Äù he said. His voice was soft and kind, that of a senile though loving grandmother. Dom imagined he felt a pull toward the man, and did as he was bidden, wincing as the light stung his eyes.

For a moment, the man stared at him, his waxen features frozen fast as stone. Then, a subtle look of compassion flickered across his face. Dom did not believe in God, but he suddenly felt like a man standing before God, his every thought, feeling, and transgression laid bare. He had never felt so naked in his life, so exposed. He had the sense that the man before him could see everything, knew everything.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been through a lot,‚Äù the man said. It was not a question, but a statement.

Everything Dom had been through over the past couple of days came back to him in a rush, and hot tears filled his eyes. He nodded.

The man nodded slightly, more to himself than to Dom. ‚ÄúKneel down,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI want to look at you.‚Äù

Dom knelt without question.

The man lifted one hand and touched Dom‚Äôs face, tilting Dom‚Äôs head from one side to the other like a farmer appraising a horse. His fingers were long and bony, his nails ragged and unkempt; his touch was like ice. He brushed his knuckles over the purple bruise on Dom‚Äôs cheek, and there was such gentleness in that one act that Dom broke down sobbing. He leaned into the man‚Äôs touch like a cat and gave voice to his misery.

‚ÄúShhh,‚Äù the man said, ‚Äúit‚Äôs all over now.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-What‚Äôs happening to me?‚Äù Dom asked.

In his heart of hearts, however, he already knew.

‚ÄúYou died,‚Äù the man said patiently. ‚ÄúAnd you came back.‚Äù

Hearing it stated so plainly, Dom cried even harder.

‚ÄúOnly a handful of people throughout history can claim to have defeated death,‚Äù the man said, stroking Dom‚Äôs hair, ‚Äúand you‚Äôre one of them. You should be proud.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù Dom asked between sobs. ‚ÄúWhat am I?‚Äù

The man stroked Dom‚Äôs cheek. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the same thing I am.‚Äù

At that, Dom looked up at the man. ‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù he asked.

A little, knowing smile touched the man‚Äôs lips, and when he spoke, his canine teeth were longer and sharper than before. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a vampire.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dom moaned and shook his head, ‚Äúno, no, no.‚Äù He grabbed the man‚Äôs hand and held tight, his tears coming faster. He trembled like a frightened animal and squeezed his eyes closed, as if by doing so he could escape the hell his life had become.

But there was no escape.

‚ÄúYou have a lot of questions,‚Äù the man said, monologuing now rather than speaking directly to Dom, ‚ÄúI had the same questions when I was your age. I have spent the last forty-two years of my life trying to answer them, but every answer I find leads me to still more questions. There‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôm certain of, though.‚Äù

Dom blinked the tears from his eyes. The last of them had been squeezed from his dead tear ducts and he had no more to give. He simply stared into space, trying to come to grips with his situation.

‚ÄúThere is freedom in death,‚Äù the man said. ‚ÄúDeath is easy. It‚Äôs simple. Once it‚Äôs over, you feel no pain, no sadness, no grief. It‚Äôs living that‚Äôs hard.‚Äù

As he spoke, he brushed his long nails across Dom‚Äôs scalp. It was a soothing feeling, and served to calm him. ‚ÄúPeople have so many¬†*troubles*.‚Äù A note of revulsion crept into his voice. ‚ÄúSo many needs, so many desires. People are complex but we‚Äôre not. We‚Äôre easy to please. A vampire wants only two things: A little blood and one more night.‚Äù

The combination of his touch and his voice had pacified Dom to the point of almost tranquility. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù Dom heard himself mumble.

Nodding almost reluctantly, the man said, ‚ÄúFear is one of the only emotions a vampire can‚Äôt escape. Everything feels fear. Do you want to know a secret?‚Äù

Dom nodded.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid too,‚Äù the man confessed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid of death. Well‚Ä¶death as it were. I‚Äôm terrified that my body will rot away and leave me a pile of bones somewhere, unable to move but still aware‚Äù

A shudder went through Dom.

‚ÄúAs I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve seen yourself, the movies lied. We rot just like any other dead thing. Our flesh decays, our organs turn to sludge, and we go from rational men to monsters whose only thought is feeding.‚Äù

Now it was his turn to shiver.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶you‚Äôre not like that,: Dom said.‚Äô

The man smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm lucky, I guess‚Äù A thin yellow fluid began to drip from his nostrils. He did not seem to notice. ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúDominick,‚Äù Dom said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Merrick,‚Äù the man said, ‚Äúand this is my family.‚Äù

Dom realized that they were now surrounded by others, ten in all. They stood ramrod straight, their eyes vacant and their faces devoid of humanity. They were mainly men, though one was a woman. Some were pale, others were blue or black, and one was little more than a skeleton clad in withered brown skin, a white button up and jeans hanging from its frame.

A thought occurred to Dom. ‚ÄúYou said my brain was going to rot‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNot necessarily,‚Äù Merrick cautioned, ‚Äúthough it‚Äôs possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúAm I going to be‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúLike them?‚Äù Merrick asked. ‚ÄúBraindead and staring?‚Äù

Sheepishly, Dom nodded.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Merrick allowed. ‚ÄúBut these people are free of everything that troubles humanity. You were human just a short time ago. I‚Äôm sure you remember all too well what it was like. The constant politics, the moral quandaries, the philosophical pontificating. Human beings - and make no mistake, we are humans - were not meant for all of that. We‚Äôre animals. We were made to hunt, fuck, and sleep. Somewhere along the way, we got pretentious and started complicating things.‚Äù He looked at Dom, sizing him up, seeming to read him. ‚ÄúThings that animals take for granted, people work their entire lives to achieve. If an animal wants to fornicate, it fornicates. If a man wants to fornicate, he needs to be tall, handsome, rich, funny, progressive when it suits women but traditional when it doesn‚Äôt. If a man wants a home, he has to work thirty years for it. An animal has only to dig a hole in the ground.‚Äù

Every word struck a chord with Dom.

Because every word was true.

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the living won‚Äôt allow us to live that freely, so we have to hide. These people here - my children - need a guiding hand, a protector, someone who can lead them. And I, an old man, need help.‚Äù Here he smiled playfully and patted his bulging stomach. ‚ÄúMy body is mostly sawdust and cotton balls at this point, so I can‚Äôt do much. I share my wisdom and my knowledge with them, and they take care of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt you‚Ä¶rotted?‚Äù Dom asked.

‚ÄúEmbalming fluid,‚Äù Merrick said. ‚ÄúBlood doesn‚Äôt sustain you. Embalming fluid does.‚Äù He smiled at Dom. ‚ÄúIt can sustain you as well. If you‚Äôll stay with us. We‚Äôre not the most attractive bunch, but we‚Äôre a family, and we really wish you‚Äôd join us.‚Äù

A family.

Dom‚Äôs parents had broken up and he lived with his mother. He had never had a family before, and had always wanted one, a real one, like in the movies. Even as a grown man, he sought the love, acceptance, and belonging that a family brings. He sought it in the wrong ways, but that - and not sex, not romantic love - is what he had really wanted all along.

This is what he had wanted all along.

‚ÄúI want to,‚Äù Dom said.

Working quickly, Merrick slashed his wrist open with his thumbnail. An ugly mixture of stale blood, siphoned from someone else, and embalming fluid leaked out. ‚ÄúIf you choose to drink, my blood will be in you. You will be my son and I will be your father. You will obey me as your father. You will do whatever is asked of you for this family, as this family will do for you. You will not reveal the secrets of this family to anyone outside of it. You will protect this family from all threats, both inside and out. Do you accept?‚Äù

He held his bleeding wrist out to Dom.

Dom did not question, nor did he hesitate. He grabbed the hand of his father, brought it to his mouth, and drank from the seeping wound. The fluid was cold, thick, and vile.

It tasted like belonging.

‚ÄúHave you fed yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Dom said.

‚ÄúBefore you do, I have a question for you. Who did this to you? Who made you?‚Äù

Dom thought. Everything was hazy.  
‚ÄúWas it someone in this room?‚Äù Merrick asked.

Dom shook his head. ‚ÄúHer name is‚Ä¶‚Äù he wracked his brain. ‚ÄúHeather.‚Äù

Merrick nodded. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs another out there.‚Äù He looked at Joe. ‚ÄúDid you turn her?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Joe said.

Merrick looked annoyed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told you not to go out and feed on your own. You have no self-control. You drink too much and create others, which creates headaches for the family. Tomorrow night, I want you and Dom to find her and bring her here.‚Äù  
‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù Joe said.

Merrick looked over Dom‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúJess? Can you come here?‚Äù

The black haired woman from earlier came out of the shadows, the drunk girl with her, arms tied behind her back. The girl looked dazed. ‚ÄúMax,‚Äù Merrick said to the skeletal corpse-thing, ‚Äúhelp her.‚Äù

Max, Jessie, and another vampire named Matt tied chains around the girl‚Äôs ankles and hoisted her aloft via a pulley system. Upside down, she swung back and forth. Merrick instructed the others to leave the room. ‚ÄúMax,‚Äù he said.

On his way out, the corpse-thing produced a knife and dragged it across the girl‚Äôs throat, slicing her skin; blood spurted out. Max leaned in to taste it, but Merrick shooed him away. When he and Dom were alone, Merrick told Dom, ‚ÄúGo to her.‚Äù

But Dom was already on his feet, his eyes transfixed by the crimson life flowing from her pumping throat. The hot, rich smell filled his nostrils and tantalized his senses. Saliva filled his mouth and his stomach panged with hunger. Some small, human part of his decaying brain screamed at him to stop, but he did not listen to it. He had been human for almost thirty years, and he had been miserable. Now, in this chamber of the undead, he gave himself over to his dark thirst. Like a man in a dream, he shuffled to her, inhaled the sweet scent of her blood, and shivered. He was so lost in lust that he hardly noticed the strange, cumbersome feeling of his descended fangs.

‚ÄúDrink,‚Äù Merrick said.

Opening his mouth wide, Dom sank his teeth into the girl‚Äôs neck. Her blood filled his mouth and splashed down his throat. Warmth thawed the ice in his marrow and spread through him. His dead heart began to flutter, then to pound. His knees shook, his body trembled, and his mind rolled away on a tide of ecstasy.

As it was his first meal, he couldn‚Äôt drink much. Before long, his stomach was hard and distended and his body burned with fire. He collapsed to a heap on the floor and twitched as random nerve endings, stimulated by the blood, began to misfire. He felt full, warm, and drunk. He closed his eyes and let himself drift.

Dominick Mason had died.

And this‚Ä¶

This was heaven.

\*\*\*

With all that was happening in the city of Albany, the last thing Bruce Kenner needed on Thursday morning was a visit from Bertha the bitch, but that‚Äôs exactly what he got. She flew into his office like she owned the place and instantly started in on him. Young man this and have you talked to Joe Rossi that. You‚Äôd think she was his boss. And if she were his boss, he‚Äôd quit and find another line of work. He heard McDonald‚Äôs was hiring.

Bruce almost snapped at her. He‚Äôd been up most of last night riding around Albany and looking for Dominick Mason. He and Vanessa expected him to drop dead somewhere close to the medical examiner‚Äôs office, but if he had, he‚Äôd done so in a super secret location.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been busy,‚Äù Bruce said, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm going to go by his place of work today.‚Äù

Tired and still confused over that bullshit from last night, he had no energy to argue with the old crone. He could spare a few minutes to talk to Joe Rossi, he figured. He assumed that Jessie was safe but he owed it to her to check. If he found the girl, he‚Äôd take her back to her grandmother (sorry, kid, really) and try to avoid arresting the guy. Unless he came off as a creep, then he‚Äôd bust his ass. See, people assumed that an older guy with a younger girlfriend was some master manipulator hell bent on evil deeds. Sometimes they were, but hell, his grandparents married when his grandpa was twenty-one and his grandma sixteen. They were married for fifty-five years and loved each other to the end. Maybe it was innocent, maybe not. It wasn‚Äôt his job to judge either way. Just gimme the girl so I can get her grandma off my back and no one gets hurt.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about time you started doing your job,‚Äù Bertha said, ‚ÄúI heard on the police scanner last night that you people lost a body. What kind of town is this? Your coroner is a drunk who makes up stories about bodies walking away. He probably sold it to black people.‚Äù

Bruce couldn‚Äôt help it; he snorted laughter.

‚ÄúNow what would black people want with a dead body?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbably to use it as a prop in one of their rap videos.‚Äù

Bruce didn‚Äôt know much about music videos, but he was pretty sure that the people who made them didn‚Äôt like the smell of corpse any more than the rest of us. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be sure to round up all the local rappers for questioning. Is there anything else I can help you with?‚Äù

Luckily for him, there was not, and Bertha left shortly thereafter. Alone and able to hear himself think, Bruce sat back in his chair and went over his mental checklist for the day. First order of business, go to Club Vlad. Second, find Dominick Mason. There were others, but that was the most important. He wanted the body found so someone could get to work explaining this whole weird thing. There had to be an explanation. The thought that there wasn‚Äôt, that a dead guy literally rose from the grave and disappeared into the night, deeply disturbed Bruce, and the more this whole thing remained ongoing, the more disturbed he would become.

Needing some fresh air, he decided to hit up Club Vlad.

Outside, the day was hot and sunny. Waves of heat shimmered from the pavement and not a single breath of air stirred in the whole world. Bruce slipped on a pair of sunglasses and drove over to Club Vlad. It occurred to him that the place might be closed during the day; it was the only place Joe Rossi was associated with. His address in the computer system was Glens Falls, far to the north. The messages he sent Jessie indicated that he lived onsite at Club Vlad.

The build, wedged between a corner store and a check cashing place, was as grimy and dumpy looking as it had always been. The front windows were blacked out and covered with posters and fliers for punk concerts, house bands, and far left political organizations: The Albany Social Justice Center, something called Bash the Fash 2025, and Bruce‚Äôs favorite. ACAB. He caught some kid spraying that on the side of the police station once, and under extreme police torture (ie, a good tongue lashing), the kid told him it meant All Cops Are Barnacleheads.

Bruce shot the kid on the spot and planted a gun on him.

How's that for barnaclehead?

Calm down, he didn‚Äôt really do that. He made him clean the graffiti off with a toothbrush. LOL he was out there for hours.

The sidewalk in front of the former theater was empty save for some little. The box office was abandoned. There was no open sigh, but then again, there was no closed sign either. He parked his cruiser at the curb, killed the engine, and got out, sweat instantly springing to his brow.

To his surprise, the door opened. Inside, a couple steps led down to a dance floor. A bar lined the wall to his right, and a couple more sets led up to a railed platform filled with tables. Above, a huge balcony looked down on him. A giant disco ball hung from the ceiling like a pair of glittery nuts and there were cages here and there. Presumably where girls danced go-go style. Oh yeah, nothing hotter than a woman behind bars. Why do you think Bruce became a cop in the first place?

Speaking of glittery nuts, there was glitter everywhere. On the floor, on the tables, on the bar. It twinkled like flecks of diamond and swirled around your feet when you walked. Bruce imagined big buckets of the stuff raining down on the dance floor at midnight and he shuddered. Imagine having glitter stuck in your hair. That shit would never come out.

Music played from the sound system, not as loud as it would be during operating hours. It sounded like ‚Äò80s metal, not exactly what he expected from a place like this.

*Some say life she's a lady*

*Kinda soft, kinda shady*

*I can tell you life is rich*

*She's no lady, she's a bitch*

Being morning, the place was deserted except for a man behind the bar, busy at cleaning the countertop in anticipation for the night‚Äôs events. He was tall, Hispanic or Italian, and feminine, with a single earring and a tank top.

Bruce moseyed over to the bar and the barkeep looked up, missing a beat when he realized the fuzz was here. He sat down his rag and walked over. ‚ÄúCan I help you?‚Äù he asked in a whispy voice.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Bruce said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Joe Rossi. Is he here?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù the bartender said. He looked nervous. ‚ÄúI can check.‚Äù

Before Bruce could answer, he scurried off, leaving him alone.

*They suck my body out*

*But friend there is no doubt*

*I'm gonna pay the devil his dues*

*Cause I'm sick of being abused*

Bruce looked around, his fingers absently drumming on the countertop. Club Vlad was a clashing mix of grunge and glam that made his head hurt. He imagined what the place must be like at midnight, packed and noisy, and nodded to himself. Yeah, this was the spot, he guessed, the place all the cool kids went, if they went anywhere anymore. Hell, if he was thirty years younger, he might come here.

He had been waiting for almost twenty minutes when a voice spoke behind him. He turned with a start, and beheld the strangest man he had ever seen in his life. Short and plump - lumpy, even - he sat in a wheelchair, a red blanket draped over his shoulders and his hands resting on his knees. He was about fifty with sparse gray hair falling to his shoulders and a plastic-looking face. He looked like a wax statue of Ben Franklin come to life, and a deep sense of disquiet stirred in the pit of Bruce‚Äôs stomach.

*Just can't fight the temptation*

*It's become my inspiration*

*Gonna get myself an axe*

*Break some heads, break some backs*

It was only then that Bruce noticed the sickly sweet smell of death.

It seemed to come from the man in waves.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to frighten you,‚Äù the man said, ‚Äúmy name is Merrick Garvis and I own Club Vlad. Maybe I can be of assistance.‚Äù

Bruce grew up in the south where manners and saving face were paramount. His mother and his grandmother both taught him that it was impolite to stare. Maybe he'd been in New York so long that he‚Äôd forgotten himself, or maybe Merrick Garvis was just the strangest looking man in the world. Either way, Bruce couldn‚Äôt help gaping at his strange appearance. Recovering, he shook his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I -‚Äù

Merrick smiled and waved one hand. Why was it so goddamn skeletal? ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I was injured in a fire a long time ago and this is the best they could do for me. To be honest, I‚Äôd stare too. What can I help you with, officer?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk to Joe Rossi,‚Äù Bruce said. ‚ÄúI understand he works for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did,‚Äù Merrick said, ‚Äúbut I had to let him go. Did he do something wrong?‚Äù

Bruce sighed. ‚ÄúWell, yeah, he‚Äôs shacked up with a sixteen year old runaway.‚Äù

A look of concern crossed Merrick‚Äôs features, such as they were. ‚ÄúOh, my, that is concerning. I haven‚Äôt seen him in several days. I assume he went home. He lives in Glens Falls.‚Äù

Bruce nodded, his mind working. If Rossi really was in Glens Falls, that meant the whole mess was someone else‚Äôs problem. He could send Bertha up there to bother some other poor barnacle head and be rid of her. Yet‚Ä¶he didn‚Äôt think Rossi¬†*was*¬†in Glens Falls. Bruce had a knack for knowing when people were lying, and he was certain that Merrick Garvis was doing just that. It couldn‚Äôt be a facial tick, as his features were largely unmoving, like clay. Maybe it was something in his cloudy eyes. Maybe it was the tone of his voice. Or maybe Bruce had the shining and knew things just for the hell of it. In any event, the certainty that Merrick Garvis was lying grew stronger with each passing second.

‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you fire him?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe got drunk and hit one of the customers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat did he do?‚Äù Bruce asked. ‚ÄúWhat was his position?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was a bouncer.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt bouncers supposed to hit people?‚Äù

Merrick fumbled. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶not to punch them in the face for bumping into them.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long did he work for you?‚Äù

‚ÄúSix months.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you ever see him with an underage girl?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course not,‚Äù Merrick said, ‚Äúyou have to be twenty-one to get in. I make sure everyone‚Äôs ID is checked at the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if she had a fake ID?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I guess she‚Äôd get in, but I‚Äôd assume she was of legal age.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said he shoved someone, when did this happen?‚Äù

‚ÄúLast week,‚Äù Merrick said.

‚ÄúI thought you said he hit someone.‚Äù

Merrick again fumbled. ‚ÄúI did.‚Äù Now his face seemed to darken a little. A strange yellowish liquid, too thin to be snot, began to drip from his nostrils. Bruce barely suppressed a smear of disgust. ‚ÄúI understand you have a job to do but playing mind games with me isn‚Äôt going to solve anything. I can give you his address. Other than that, I can‚Äôt help you further.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough,‚Äù Bruce said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôd like to see your ID please.‚Äù

Merrick glared at him. ‚ÄúI suppose you want my name, rank, and serial number as well.‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, yeah, I‚Äôd love that.‚Äù

Merrick drew a deep sigh. ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù

In five minutes, Bruce had Merrick‚Äôs ID, social, and all other relevant information. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn‚Äôt have bothered, even though he was well within his rights to ask for this information from someone he was questioning. But something about Merrick Garvis was off, and not just his weird face or strangely bulbous body. Bruce was just smart enough to realize that something was going on here, but not quite smart enough to even begin to imagine what.

When he had everything he needed and saw no reason to stick around, Bruce bid Merrick farewell and left the club. Before he could do anything else, he got a call from dispatch: Officer needed assistance in Pine Hills. Bruce slipped behind the wheel and went forth to help, momentarily putting Merrick Garvis out of his mind.

But soon or later, he would get back to him.

Oh yes he would.",15 May 2024 14:32:19,reddit

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Herq, Tilfish Junior Exterminator***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: December 3rd, 2136*

‚ÄúUnderstood, on our way.‚Äù Frankie stuffed his radio away.

‚ÄúW-What? More Arxur?‚Äù I shivered.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think so. Hope not. We gotta go to the van.‚Äù

The human didn't give me time to reply as he stepped over the body like it wasn‚Äôt even there. Swallowing some bile, I took aimed steps around it. The smell of blood wasn‚Äôt as bad as I thought it would be. It wasn‚Äôt any worse than burning flesh.

The stomps of Frankie‚Äôs boots down the stairs reminded me to keep moving. I scuttled down the stairs, turning the corner to see another body I was forced to step around. Two of them had come after us, two who were even more eager than the first group we encountered.

‚ÄúDo you t-think it‚Äôs the same ones from before?‚Äù I asked.

The human grunted. ‚ÄúHell if I know. But I wouldn‚Äôt doubt it one bit if it was. Guy got his ego hurt, and wanted some revenge. God knows if he was waiting there for an ambush.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Ä¶ couldn‚Äôt have known about the weapons, right?‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúMaybe. He at least knew we were stranded without a vehicle. Maybe put his bets on us getting some transport.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt have much time to ponder it. Frankie was already peeking outside the building, shotgun raised. I came up behind him, checking behind as we scooted out of the building. Once he was confident, Frankie dashed towards the van.

We came upon it quickly. I was glad the Arxur he shot was on the other side to spare me from the gore. He turned around to the backside of the van, where his face contorted. ‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, coming around next to him.¬†

The scaly legs are the first thing I saw. They led up to its back, which looked like it had exploded. Blood was nearly everywhere around the gray, and I even thought I saw a piece of bone. My whole body begged me to run away from the gore, to find a corner to throw up in, but I couldn't look away. And that didn't even cover the Yotul.

The green-stained wraps around his legs were the first thing I noticed after the hulking mass of reptile. His right paw was a bleeding mess haphazardly wrapped in a loose bandage, and his other was curled around an Arxur gun‚Äî*its* gun, I realized. His face had speckles of red on it, much like the rest of the van. There was what could only be described as a huge gun beside him.¬†

Relief washed over his features once he saw us, and he let the weapon clatter onto a bloody crate. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Luke?‚Äù

I watched Frankie for any signs of turning feral, despite the improbability of it ever happening. The copious amount of blood was more than enough to drive any predator into a crazed frenzy, but still Frankie showed enormous restraint. If anything, he almost looked‚Ä¶ disgusted by it. I shouldn‚Äôt have been surprised.

He took a quick breath to steady himself. ‚ÄúUh, Dusty took a few rounds, he‚Äôs patching her up. I see you can‚Ä¶ handle yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù the Yotul spat back. ‚ÄúIt almost‚Ä¶‚Äù His voice broke, and he shook his head.

Frankie nodded. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get moving. I‚Äôll‚Ä¶ clear the way, if you could help him, Herq.‚Äù The human crouched down and gripped the monster's legs and gave a tug. He started sliding the body out of the way, a trail of blood marking every crate it was slumped over.

I took a step forward, suppressing a gag at the sights and smells. It was like walking into a predator‚Äôs den. Dark and damp and terrible, with evidence of what happened drowning my entire field of view. ‚ÄúW-What happened? It looks-‚Äù

‚ÄúI shot the bastard.‚Äù¬†

I twitched my antennae. ‚ÄúR-Right.‚Äù I took several breaths before finding the strength to proceed. I tried to ignore the blood marked across the walls and creeped in, though I couldn‚Äôt ignore the green smears that were on the crates. I did my best to avoid stepping on‚Ä¶ anything, really.

The Yotul grabbed a red box full of first aid supplies and set it by his right side. He began to peel off the green-stained gauze on his paw. ‚ÄúI need an extra paw for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course. You‚Äôre Reno, right?‚Äù He ignored me. I felt a shiver spread through my carapace as he revealed the wound. ‚ÄúT-Those look like-‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, *I know*.‚Äù

I gave him a flick of my antennae. He raised a bottle of what I assumed to be antibiotic solution, which I took. I gingerly uncapped the bottle and murmured, ‚ÄúThis is going to sting.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you constantly state the obvious? Just get it over with.‚Äù

I took his paw in my feeler and generously poured it over the wound. He let out a small groan, but nothing more. I wiped it, then took some gauze and began wrapping it far better than he could with just a paw and a mouth. I tightened it, and sealed it with some adhesive.¬†

‚ÄúThere. I-I think that‚Äôs good, but I don‚Äôt commonly work with other species.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can tell.‚Äù The Yotul began to get up on their injured legs.

‚ÄúA-Are you sure you should be walking?‚Äù He ignored me again. I stuck out an arm to help him. ‚ÄúHere, at least-‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need your help,‚Äù he spat, slapping me away with annoyance. He shakily stood up, leaning precariously against the side of the van atop the crates.

I waved my antennae with concern. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ Let me know if-‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù he coldly said, not giving me so much as a glance back as he hobbled out of the van.

*I don‚Äôt blame him. The Arxur looked like he was inches away from tearing him apart. Not to mention the claw marks on his wrist‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt imagine what happened to him just moments ago.*

I crawled out of the van after him, glad to be out, but probably not nearly as glad as him. Frankie came from around the van and dusted his hands.¬†

‚ÄúThat was gross.‚Äù He turned to Reno. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre up already? Your legs are-‚Äù

‚ÄúWorry about them when we‚Äôre in the truck. We need to get the fuck away from here.‚Äù He leaned against the van, catching his breath. He was clearly in pain, but didn‚Äôt want to show it.

‚ÄúGotcha. Luke should be‚Äîah, right there.‚Äù

I followed his gaze, spotting the truck rolling towards us with its cracked windows and decorated doors. It stopped right beside the van. A human stepped out, the same one from the predator disease facility. He took one look at Reno, worry spreading across his face. ‚ÄúHoly shit.‚Äù

Reno grunted. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Frankie said.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ We can talk in the truck,‚Äù Luke decided.¬†

‚ÄúIs my gun still in the building?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the backseat.‚Äù

The Yotul lowered his head, letting out a breath of relief. I didn‚Äôt understand how much a simple firearm could possibly mean to him, but I wasn‚Äôt about to question him about it.

Lieutenant Holtas came to the other side of the van, whistling once he saw the crate. ‚ÄúDamn, this is‚Ä¶ a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough to turn the tide, I hope?‚Äù Frankie asked.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a chance it might be‚Ä¶ If there‚Äôs anything left once we get back. Two of their bunkers are already swarming with Arxur.‚Äù

‚ÄúT-Two?‚Äù I stammered. ‚ÄúWhich ones?‚Äù

The predator shook his head dismissively. ‚ÄúTalk later.‚Äù

I shook my antennae in irritation, until another human then emerged from around the truck. It was the dark-skinned, dark-haired human from before as well, Dusty. Her vest had several lesions across it, far more than the few Frankie had received during his gutsiness. She wasn‚Äôt unscathed, however, as her left sleeve had been pulled up, revealing a stripe of bandaging. Her eyes regarded me with an expression I couldn't decipher, turning into a more shocked expression when they saw Reno. ‚Äú...Damn.‚Äù

The Lieutenant turned to her. ‚ÄúKeep an eye out from where they came. Reno, do the same for the other side of the street. I‚Äôm not looking to get ambushed again.‚Äù

The two signaled their understanding. Luke‚Äôs gaze lingered a little longer on the wounded Yotul as he hobbled to retrieve his weapon from the truck.

Frankie grunted from behind me, picking up two big and bloodied crates. ‚ÄúOpen the doors, would ya?‚Äù

I obliged, yanking open the hatches to the truck so the burly human could deposit the weapons. Luke walked past me, saw the mess in the back of the van, and shook his head while muttering something. Still, he crouched and grabbed two crates in each hand.

I couldn‚Äôt very well just stand around, so I begrudgingly walked over and picked the cleanest crates I could manage while repelling the numerous dry heaves my body wanted to conjure. I hefted them up, and followed the same path as Luke and Frankie.¬†

I passed Dusty, who groaned, rubbing her left arm. ‚ÄúWhy do these idiots use such a small caliber? You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd want to *kill* the people they‚Äôre shooting at.‚Äù

I nervously tilted my antennae. ‚ÄúYou would‚Ä¶ hope so.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey enjoy the thrill of the hunt,‚Äù Reno growled. ‚ÄúUse it to just incapacitate their *prey*. Dead ones don‚Äôt squirm while they‚Äôre eaten.‚Äù

An uncomfortable silence fell over the street. As we continued to load the human armaments into the truck, the two kept a cautious set of eyes out on either side of the street. Frankie managed to fit the big gun back into its respective crate while Luke stared at it, incredulously. Dusty glanced back with a similar look, which gave me the feeling the predators were all thinking the same thing. The only one who didn‚Äôt break his focus was Reno.

The van got emptier, the truck got fuller, and soon enough we were ready to leave this place for good. Luke gave us the clear and got into the driver seat. Frankie took the front passenger seat, leaving the three of us to squeeze into the back. The windshield left a lot to be desired, and I wondered if Luke would even be able to see through it.

It was cramped, to say the least. I was forced into the side, with the Yotul in the middle, while Dusty filled in the remaining seat. From someone looking in from outside, it would be a very strange sight to behold.

She slammed the door shut. ‚ÄúTight fuckin‚Äô fit. Hope we have enough fuel.‚Äù

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt be an issue,‚Äù Luke said, sending the engine revving as we began to accelerate.

*Thank Formi we‚Äôre finally leaving. How long have I been awake for? How long have the Arxur been in Tepisil? And how are the exterminators from the human camp doing? There‚Äôs far too much to worry about.*

I hoped Tealk was fine in the hatchery‚Äôs bunker. That is, if it wasn‚Äôt already compromised. Tepisil was given the tiny mercy of just a small warning prior to any bombs dropping. The shelters were likely packed to the brim. Just waiting for the Arxur to come.

‚ÄúFrankie, give me some light, would ya?‚Äù Dusty ordered. She had pulled Reno‚Äôs hindlegs on her lap, and was now inspecting them with the help of Frankie‚Äôs flashlight. I could see the green blood that had leaked down his legs from the wounds, along with pieces of black debris.

Reno had no choice but to let Dusty tend to him. I tried my best to ignore the blood she was forcing out by ripping through the bandages, though I gagged upon seeing her dig into his flesh with a pair of tweezers, pulling out a small bullet while he hissed in pain. Those were the only noises for a time while the human used a strange syringe to push some sort of foam into the wound, then tightly wrapping his legs.

She did a better job than I ever could‚Äôve. At this point, it shouldn‚Äôt have impressed me that the predators had a concept of medicine or even treatment for the wounded, rather than just leaving the weak for dead. The amount of care she put into someone from another species spoke volumes to the humans‚Äô empathetic capacity.

The streetlights of the city finally receded from us. I could almost feel the weighty air in the truck lighten, like a part of the despair had been left behind in Dirlsil. It wouldn‚Äôt last for long.

At some point in the middle of all the crop fields, Frankie cleared his throat. ‚ÄúCan I be the one to break the silence? ‚ÄòCause Reno shot that gray with a whole bloody anti-materiel rifle.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôm glad somebody finally fucking said it. Point blank, too,‚Äù Dusty said.

The Yotul didn‚Äôt offer a response, only stared off into the distance. I felt nothing but sympathy for him. They meant well, but I suspected they did more harm than good. The humans clearly had no idea what he‚Äôd just gone through; the fear, the uncertainty, the possibility of being eaten alive. I had a feeling the only reason he was alive was because of his quick thinking, the Arxur‚Äôs cockiness, and luck.¬†

Luke cleared his throat. ‚ÄúUh, how did you fare, Frankie? I saw the marks on your vest.‚Äù

My human grunted. ‚ÄúBarely even felt them hit me. Once the shooting started we dove back into the toy shop. Arxur are damn cocky bastards, but I don‚Äôt reckon they‚Äôre used to whatever they‚Äôre chasing fighting back so hard. Shot one, ran up the stairs, shot the other. Easy as that.‚Äù

It was *not*, in fact, as easy as that. I was terrified the entire time. It was Frankie who did everything, and even then, he screamed and shouted during the entire encounter. He was fearless in the face of fear while I had been useless. Again. My only saving grace was that I didn‚Äôt *freeze* like I did at the PD facility, even if that meant I merely ran instead. I felt a stab of anger mixed with regret, an entirely unwelcome feeling that I decidedly earned.

*I can‚Äôt rely on the Terrans forever. At some point, my uncontrollable fear is going to cost lives. I‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt let fear be the driver.*

‚ÄúWe had four of the fuckers on us,‚Äù Dusty said. ‚ÄúRetreated into the store opposite yours. We were doing just fine ‚Äòtill one of them tossed a grenade.‚Äù

I felt Reno tense up to me. He had a thousand-lightyear stare.¬†

‚ÄúThen they came in after us, separated us from Reno. They were fucking relentless, didn‚Äôt give us a chance to fight. Forced us all the way back into the stockroom, then kept pushing their luck. Finally had a corner, then the bastards leapt forward rather than being *smart*, getting me tagged. Hurts like hell just *thinking* about flexing the muscle.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod, can we change the subject? I regret asking,‚Äù Lieutenant Holtas said, shifting uncomfortably. ‚ÄúFrankie, you want to try again with the UN? And Herq, now that you‚Äôre with us, can you contact Von and inform him of what happened?‚Äù

I almost flinched when he said my name. ‚ÄúY-Yeah, of course.‚Äù I started to pull out my holopad. I hovered over Tealk‚Äôs contact before moving to Von‚Äôs. I tapped the icon, and it rang for only a second before he picked up.

*‚ÄúHerq?‚Äù*

I pulled the pad closer, overhearing Frankie start his own call to the UN. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs me. We made it out of Dirlsil with the weapons, and we‚Äôre in one piece.‚Äù

*‚ÄúFormi is that good to hear. I won't sugarcoat it, things have gotten much worse. You may have heard it from the humans, but cattle shuttles just landed around Bunker Four‚Ä¶ which has no one to defend it. Bunker Six had contact and they are at a stalemate, but won't stay that way. I‚Ä¶ sincerely hope you brought lots of ammo.‚Äù*

I swallowed a lump in my throat. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say for certain what the predators brought with us‚Ä¶ We‚Äôre driving as fast as we can, we expect to be there in forty minutes.‚Äù

*‚ÄúToo long‚Ä¶ The grays are already going into buildings, trying to flush them out. We don‚Äôt have the firepower.‚Äù*

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ We need a rally point in order to distribute them as fast as possible.‚Äù

*‚ÄúOne advantage is that they aren‚Äôt using their numbers prowling the empty buildings on the outskirts‚Ä¶ Shit, Polle is calling me‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs about Bunker Six. Listen, I‚Äôll send you more information when I can. Call me ten minutes before you reach the city.‚Äù*

‚ÄúYes, of course. Please, stay safe.‚Äù

*‚ÄúWe both know that isn‚Äôt going to happen. Hurry.‚Äù*

A tone signified he hung up the call. I tentatively swirled my antennae, seeing my company look away. ‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm guessing everyone heard that?‚Äù

Reno flicked his ears, and the humans nodded from the front seats. A steady silence came over us. It was probably well into the early hours of the morning at this point. My body was tired, and my mind more so. I knew well that I should have been more scared or worried, but I simply didn‚Äôt have the energy. It was like Frankie said earlier.

‚ÄúWho wants a granola bar?‚Äù Frankie abruptly barked.¬†

Luke shrugged. ‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

The two humans accepted his offer, not like they had much choice since they were already being distributed. A bar was put into Reno‚Äôs paws, and suddenly, I was holding one too.

‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt have meat, does it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo, you idiot. *I* don‚Äôt eat meat,‚Äù Reno hissed, unwrapping his food.

‚ÄúSorry‚Ä¶ I just wanted-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bar of sugary grain. You‚Äôd think you would know by now that humans aren‚Äôt going to hurt you, or do anything else ‚Äòpredatory.‚Äô‚Äù He said the last word with distaste, like it personally offended him. He was clearly more used to the primates than I was, or ever could be. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt mean me any harm, but it was hard to shake off the thoughts that always lingered in my mind when around predators.

I thought his behavior was simply fried nerves from his close call with the Arxur, but there was something more to it, something bitter in his tone that hinted at more than just the last encounter. It reminded me of hearing about his outburst at my sister, Tealk, back at the hatchery. It didn‚Äôt sit right with me, but I wasn‚Äôt in any position to ask him about it, especially not at that moment.

Dusty was already stuffing the bar into her mouth, not much caring for how revolting I found it. I‚Äôd gotten used to their toothy smiles, but seeing her take a *bite*, just like she would chow down on a piece of bloody meat‚Ä¶ If I wasn‚Äôt so hungry after so many hours, I would‚Äôve lost my appetite.

Reno bit into the bar, and I carefully unwrapped mine, ignoring the female‚Äôs sickening mouth movements. I gave a cautionary sniff before taking a small nibble. It was acceptable, even good considering I hadn‚Äôt eaten for so long. I took another bite, then another, and then I noticed Dusty looking at me.

I couldn‚Äôt help the way my muscles tensed in agitation. She was instinctively sizing me up, now that food was on her mind. ‚ÄúW-What is it?‚Äù I stuttered.

She raised her eyebrows, glancing away. ‚ÄúNothing. Just the way you move your hands, er‚Ä¶ tarsals? Tarsals, across your mandibles when you eat. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ nevermind.‚Äù

*My‚Ä¶ tarsals?* I flexed a feeler, inspecting it like something was wrong with it. I looked back at the predator, who was now looking out the window. At least she wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ *staring* at me anymore. Humans got stranger every moment I spent with them. I thought there was a glimmer of hope that they wouldn‚Äôt all be as strange as Frankie, but that clearly had yet to be proven.

I took another small bite. Before I knew it, I had eaten the whole thing and had nothing left to occupy the time. There were only dark crop fields outside our truck, and predators or the predator-diseased inside. Nothing to distract me from the knowledge that Sillis was going to fall. Nothing to distract me from the thoughts telling me to give up, to run away, like a coward.

A muted atmosphere of haunting tranquility came over our vehicle, one that everyone silently and willfully acknowledged. We all knew what we were driving towards.

632,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1csnpyu/every_side_quest_reviewed_share_your/,Every side quest reviewed - share your favorites/most hated quests,"I loved Rebirth, and while the side quests were vastly improved they were still pretty hit or miss. Which side quests did you like/hate?

I‚Äôve decided to review all 36 quests for some ungodly reason. 

Grasslands:

* Flowers from the Hill - C
    * Kinda cute storyline, but they missed an opportunity for some Aerith backstory - idk, what‚Äôs her favorite flower or something? Or a memory tied to flowers? Devious on hard mode.
* Lifeline in Peril - F
    * I don‚Äôt like Kyrie, I don‚Äôt really like to not like Kyrie. A collectathon and doesn‚Äôt have much to do with Barret. A unique boss, but not a very interesting one.
* A Rare Card Lost - A
    * I like the bartender‚Äôs dialogue and VA, you get a great reward, and there‚Äôs a nice scene with Tifa that gets referenced later in a meaningful way. Wish there was more to Thorin, though.
* Livestock‚Äôs Bane - D
    * You get some Red development, but it‚Äôs a tracking quest and I don‚Äôt like the setup or enemy at the end.
* Where the Wind Blows - A
    * A lot of setup required, but the Broden stuff is good and is referenced later. The boss fight is pretty good (the first time). Doesn‚Äôt have much to do with Red.
* Hustle and Grind - C
    * I don‚Äôt really like Beck‚Äôs Badasses, but the interview is silly and you get to see the motorbike dudes. An  annoying fight and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Barret, though.


Junon:

* Stuck in a Rut - C
    * Kind of awkward setup but I like the wrinkly old tatted dude and you get a good view of the cost from the hut on the cliff. Following the map was OK.
* When Words Won‚Äôt Do - A+
    * Probably my favorite quest and it‚Äôs an escort mission! Top tier banter between Barret and Cloud and the bow wow wow song is so good.
* Calling All Frogs - B
    * I wish there were fewer enemies for the frog encounter because it drags on for too long. Quirky, weird, and Tifa and Cloud flirt. Also frogs are cool.
* The Hardest Sell - D
    * I still don‚Äôt like her. The decorations bump it up to a D, though. Red has nothing to do with this quest.
* Dreaming of Blue Skies - C
    * A nice scene with Tifa at the end, but it‚Äôs a tracking quest. Not particularly interesting, but overall OK.
* Tides of War and Worry - A
    * I liked this mini game. Revisiting it once much later on was fine and it doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome (and it‚Äôs pretty easy).
* Beneath Still Waters - C
    * A unique boss, and we get to see our infantry bros again, but aside from them not turning us in there‚Äôs nothing interesting about this encounter. Not any Aerith development.

Corel:

* The Saga of the Seaside Inn - B
    * Unique premise, and Yuffie and Cloud continue talking about it as you have to come back to it later. I don‚Äôt like collecting the wood blocks - mindless busy work.
* Rendezvous in Costa del Sol - F
    * Look I really don‚Äôt want to do those mini games again. The Aerith date is kind of off-putting. Fair enough, it makes some sense but it‚Äôs still a bummer.
* Bodybuilders in a Bind - D
    * I had trouble finding the group of monsters on the hill. The food talk with Tifa is OK, but kind of boring. Missed opportunity to talk about Zangan which would have been much more interesting. The sit-up mini game was way too unforgiving.
* Of Robed Men and Ransoms - C
    * A unique mini dungeon with a unique vibe is cool. Makes sense that it‚Äôs a Red quest. I don‚Äôt like the team rocket duo at the end, they aren‚Äôt really interesting in any way.
* Missing: Mr. Birdie - F
    * Cute premise, but I did not like setting and then returning to the traps.
* Trouble in Paradise - C
    * Kyrie, but you get to threaten to kill her. Also a cool boss fight at the end of this quest. A Yuffie quest even though she really has nothing to do with it.
* Gold Cup or Bust - F
    * I really like the lore for this quest, and it‚Äôs only a bit of a stretch for it to be a Tifa quest. But man, you have to do a LOT of races for this one. Too many.
* Sand and Circuses - C
     * Cool to see Leslie again, will probably come back next game. Some of those fights were kind of annoying, and it forced me to use the materia menu a lot which is always a pain.
* Can‚Äôt Stop, Won‚Äôt Stop - F
    * He should have stopped. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt bugged for me.

Gongaga:

* The Pursuit of Perfection - A
    * I liked following the pictures. Nothing to complain about here.
* O Chicken, Where Art Thou - F
    * Annoying AF. Funny ending. 
* Teach Me, Great Warrior - D
    * Despite the Zach connection I wasn‚Äôt really feeling it. The enemies died too quickly to be staggered, that was annoying. 
* The Spice of Life - F
    * Too much work and not really any payoff. Not really any Aerith development either.
* Escape from Endless Writer‚Äôs Block - C
    * Kind of annoying to actually get the photos, but story-wise it was nice.
* Woodland Vigil - F
    * I did not like going back and forth to do the spotting, and we don‚Äôt really learn anything about Zach or Cissnei. 

Cosmo Canyon:

* Bonds of Trust - F
    * Did not like this mini game. And you have to do it three times. The story is boring and predictable.  Really wish the chocobos could just fly, gliding isn‚Äôt nearly as fun.
* Absence of a Sign - D
    * A cute moment between Aerith and Cloud, but I didn‚Äôt like fighting that same scorpion 3 times and taking the pictures was finicky. 
* From Whence Life Flows - D
    * I didn‚Äôt like following this particular map, I didn‚Äôt like having to do them in a specific order and I feel like you don‚Äôt really learn much lore from this quest which is kind of annoying.
* Promises to Keep - D
    * Didn‚Äôt like running across the desert and the story is kind of nonsensical? I like how they handled the Gi overall in this game, though.
* Victim of Circumstance - F
    * Hated following the signal, hated fighting enemies that can swallow party members.

Nibel:

* Esoteric Secrets of the Elders - C
    * Picking up the plants is kind of fun, there‚Äôs a kooky guy in a chocobo onesie. 
* My White-Haired Angel - C
    * A little too long, a little too annoying of an escort quest. Still nice and it‚Äôs kind of funny to keep the cat catching theme going. Funny to have the cats in the piano performance at the end.
* Lament of the Damned - D
    * Shinra manor was kind of a letdown, and even though you get to go on a quest with Vincent the actual encounters in the combat simulator were way too repetitive. 

Phew. Well what does everyone else think?",15 May 2024 11:32:47,reddit
633,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreaticcancer/comments/1csjb8k/mom_passed_last_week/,Mom Passed Last Week,"Things are going well for such a long time. It‚Äôs not that it was unexpected, just things were going well for such a long time. It‚Äôs not that it was unexpected because I think we‚Äôre anticipating the grief for long time- but it doesn‚Äôt make it suck any less. My Mom was diagnosed almost two years ago. Did the most rounds of chemo of anyone in our cancer Center, and did so with such grace, such strength. Was a nurse through and through for 35 years and I was absolutely floored at her support system. Her same graduating class were honor guards for the funeral wearing the traditional nursing outfits, and her last hospital stay was on a newly renovated unit at the same floor she worked at her entire career. People she trained in and co-workers bid her farewell when she left the hospital. 

She always celebrated life. Every time I came back from Asia there would always be a huge welcome home banner, balloons and family. I wanted to do the same thing for her coming home, so I did.

Because of the experience we had booked in our small town of Newfoundland and constantly getting second opinions in Toronto and Johns Hopkins in Maryland - a lot of things will become the new standard at our hospital in Newfoundland. The major one of those being genetic and somatic testing- which up until my Mom was not something that was the standard at EH. Enzymes, which we started her on immediately will also be pushed from the get go, as well as discussions of nerve blocks to potentially alleviate pain and reduce the amount of opioids needed towards the end.

As far as the death, I don‚Äôt think we could‚Äôve asked for anything more peaceful for long time I couldn‚Äôt reconcile anticipating my mom‚Äôs death because I saw it to myself that normally people would get old and died at home in bed peacefully- there was one final hospital stay after the onset of a ascites- and her dying wish was to come home to die at our house. we called the ambulance one last time the palliative care ambulance team, which has been wonderful, because she suddenly started slipping in and out of consciousness and they let us know that it could be end of life event. At this time, my sister snapped her fingers like she usually did for my mom to come through and she woke up and smiled, went unconscious again. The paramedics asked her if she was in any pain and she said no, not in any pain that was rattling injection, which basically dries out the mucous membranes and put into that rattling. 

We basically still thought up until that time that maybe it was just the Dilaudid made her sleepy. We all god in bed- my sister was sleeping on the end of the bed, our Shiba Inu was lying on her lap. My dad was cuddling her and I was sitting on the chair right next to her bedside. She just fell asleep eventually. My dad and my sister also fell asleep not even for admit it and I heard her take the last couple breaths. I woke them up and told her she‚Äôs gone.

I think for a little while after I was angry just because a lot of the options that I mentioned in the initial post, we‚Äôre not things that our oncologist notified us of proactively. It was more me and my sister, having an Asian studies background and my sister with an accounting one brought these to the table after , every single day reading research articles.  Many praised the oncology team in our province. I have a harder time reconciling the fact that me and my sister with non-medical backgrounds were the ones to bring some of these options to the table to me that didn‚Äôt make a fantastic oncologist. nn praised the oncology team in our province. I have a harder time rectifying the fact that people with non-medical backgrounds were the ones to bring some of these options to the table to me that didn‚Äôt make a fantastic oncologist. 

We also found out later the Canadian lab made an error in the Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB), showing it as a 1, while foundation one found the same biopsy sample to have a TMB of 24, making her a optimal candidate for Keytruda. This was a let down days before she passed because she was too sick to go on immunotherapy, and at that point was being constantly drained, and the bowels were obstructed, with constant vomiting. We did our best to keep her comfortable, and she enjoyed just having smoothies and nothing she liked better than watermelon. Please make sure when doing testing to test through a stable company that has a longstanding reputation. They‚Äôve since gone bankrupt and there are no avenues for exploring what went wrong.

We ended up raising almost 6000.00 at this point for Craig‚Äôs Cause which has been an invaluable source of emotional support and patient advocacy. She wanted that in lieu of flowers or donations at the funeral. 

To everyone battling this disease, keep lighting the path. We will eventually turn the tide on these statistics; but only if each of you advocate for yourselves and demand the best.

Stay strong.

Additional rant below:

And in summary for people just joining this terrible club, there are the following lessons in bullet point that I‚Äôve summed up below and feel strongly (yes, even in small-town hospitals where the oncologists ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time‚Äù to help you to choose beneficial clinical trials or explain your latest scans- other then to use RECIST 1.1 criteria to monitor your tumor growth) that every patient should be familiar with and educated about. I‚Äôve linked associated studies with the options, but obviously things are always changing and requires some self-research but definitely an oncologist should be familiar and open to discussing.

1. [Pancreatic Enzymes](https://www.hpbonline.org/article/S1365-182X(22)01495-2/fulltext)
2. Genetic Testing
3. Somatic Testing
4. Celiac Plexus Block

If you look at the Canadian healthcare system as a whole for instance- the patient has enough on their plate. They can‚Äôt fix staffing issues so that Oncologists have more time to get up to speed on the latest and greatest in research. But where things can be helped is truly in advocacy organizations like Craig‚Äôs Cause. PANCAN was a huge help as well just because once you start self-referring to trials out of country, it helps to minimize the leg work in any ways possible and they really did highlight beneficial relevant trials for us.

None of the advances in Pancreatic Cancer mean jack shit if the patient is not aware of them and the oncologist does not sit down and talk to them about options. Let me tell you when we  had the first oncologist appointment me and my sister were already on Enzymes- Genetic and Somatic testing. Prior to that the oncologist said she had one patient who had undergone somatic testing, that it was expensive, and most likely would not yield any different treatment outcomes then the two chemos they had lined up for my Mom. I also hated the view of her options as somewhat static. Guidelines and research emerg slow, but I was basically shocked to actually learn that oncologists essentially write you off, and weren‚Äôt familiar with many of the options that we later explored.

Yes, my Mom‚Äôs condition really shook up my life. As someone with ADHD too, I‚Äôve never been more applied in my life to something, almost obsessive. I thought things would go according to plan, and we could somewhat predict things- first line failure, second line-failure- then that would be the end of what Canadian healthcare could do for us, and we would be right on the third standard of care in the US right away because, unlike for most of my life, I came prepared. I contacted her oncologist to arrange for approval of that third chemo because I was advised there would be red tape, that the drug was on back order or little known about it, or just approved in Ontario. I‚Äôm talking I contacted the manufacturer and distributor and they provided information to have the drug supplied from out of country, and prior to that to have the application to the provincial medical officer sent off so that if the need arise to use the third chemo, we wouldn‚Äôt be waiting. 

The oncologist essentially came to the appointment and informed my Mom we would be stopping chemo after the second line failed. She said nothing about her response saying she would look into it two months prior. It took another week for her to consult with colleges who didn‚Äôt seem to know anything about the drugs availability in Canada. The Cancer drug navigator at the hospital was also unaware. This kind of needless and careless degrees really frustrated me.

As Yusuf prepared to depart the headquarters after his confrontation with the Red Lion, a mysterious figure emerged from the shadows. A woman with sharp features and a piercing gaze, named Layla, introduced herself. Layla was a double agent working for another clandestine organization called the Silver Eagle. She offered to assist Yusuf in thwarting Black Shadow's scheme in exchange for information about the Silver Eagle.
Meanwhile, in another part of the city, a young and brilliant inventor named Omar was working on a revolutionary invention that could turn the tide against Black Shadow. He possessed technology capable of remotely detecting and disabling weapons. However, Omar required Yusuf's protection to complete his invention and test it in the real world.
With a newfound alliance formed between Yusuf, Layla, and Omar, the plan to stop Black Shadow was set in motion. Unbeknownst to them, however, a traitor lurked among them ‚Äì Faris, who was secretly working for Black Shadow. Faris plotted to exploit Omar's invention for Black Shadow's gain, turning the tables in their favor.
Would Yusuf and his team manage to uncover Faris's treachery before it was too late? And would they succeed in utilizing Omar's invention to save the city and foil Black Shadow's plans.

636,https://www.reddit.com/r/latterdaysaints/comments/1csho7o/thoughts_on_abinadis_story_in_mosiah_1117/,Thoughts on Abinadi's story in Mosiah 11-17,"Just spent the last several hours writing this for myself in preparation for teaching Sunday School this upcoming Sunday. Thought I'd share it here too for anyone interested. (I didn't cite my outside sources, besides scriptures, because I was just writing these notes for myself. But it pulls from various places of research that I can point you to if interested, especially from Scripture Central.)

# Mosiah 11-17: Abinadi

Abinadi has a *tremendous* impact on the rest of the Book of Mormon and the religious history of the Nephites and Lamanites. He converted Alma the Elder, whose personal ministry and the ministries of his descendants (Alma the Younger, Helaman, Shiblon, Corianton, Helaman II, Nephi II, Lehi, Nephi III, Timothy, Jonas, Nephi IV, Amos the Elder, Amos the Younger, Ammaron) convert 1000s to the gospel, and lead the Church all the way to the visitation of Christ to the Americas and afterwards until Mormon.

In the order it is presented (shortly after Mosiah 1-6), we see a direct parallel between:

* King Benjamin (reign ended in 130 BC) of Zarahemla as a *righteous* king who labored with his own hands (and not off the work of his people) and taught them in the ways of righteousness; and
* King Noah (died sometime between 145-122 BC) of Shilom as a *wicked* king who exploited labor and wealth from his people and taught them wickedness.

Mormon, when abridging the Record of Zeniff, frames the story of King Noah of Shilom and Abinadi specifically as a parallel to Pharaoh of Egypt (another wicked king) and Moses.

# Mosiah 11:1-19

|Pharaoh & Moses|Noah & Abinadi|
|:-|:-|
|Pharaoh, as a new king, moves away from the traditions of his father (Ex. 1:8)|King Noah does not walk in the ways of his father (Mosiah 11:1-2)|
|Pharaoh subjects the Jews (Ex. 1:13-14)|King Noah subjects his people (Mosiah 11:1-15)|
|Pharaoh installs wise men and sorcerers (Ex. 7:11)|King Noah installs wicked priests (Mosiah 11:5)|

Note that the emphasis of ""one fifth part"" in v. 3 is repeated five times: an instance of ""thematic repetition"", a Hebraism that is meant to emphasize a specific theme. In this case, it emphasizes the heaviness of the burden placed on the people that this 20% net worth tax represented.

According to the Law of Moses, there was only supposed to be *one* high priest (Leviticus 21:10). However, v. 11 says that Noah had consecrated ""high *priests*""; he was abusing and corrupting the Law of Moses for his benefit and the benefit of his friends.

# Mosiah 11:20-25

Abinadi, ""a man among them"" (someone who lived among them), then comes forth to prophesy and preach against the people. He has clearly, with direction from the Lord, prepared a specific statement that is supposed to preached. This preparation is evident in its chiasmic form:

*   A. Behold, **thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me**, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord‚ÄîWo be unto this people,
    *   B. for **I have seen** *their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms*; 
        *   C. and **except they repent** I will visit them in mine anger.
            *   D. And **except** they repent and turn to **the Lord their God**,
                *   E. behold, **I will deliver them** into the hands of their enemies;
                    *   F. yea, and **they shall be brought into bondage**; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.
                        *   G. And it shall come to pass that they shall know that **I am the Lord their God**, and am a jealous God, 
                            *   H. visiting **the iniquities of my people**.
                            *   H. And it shall come to pass that except **this people repent**
                        *   G. and turn unto **the Lord their God**,
                    *   F. **they shall be brought into bondage**;
                *   E. and **none shall deliver them**,
            *   D. **except** it be **the Lord the Almighty God**.
        *   C. Yea, and it shall come to pass that when they shall cry unto me I will be slow to hear their cries; yea, and I will suffer them that they be smitten by their enemies. And **except they repent** in sackcloth and ashes, and cry mightily to the Lord their God,
    *  B.  **I will not hear** *their prayers, neither will I deliver them out of their afflictions*;
*   A. and **thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me**.

The beginning and end of his message are also *filled* with prophetic speech forms common throughout the Old Testament and recognized by those familiar with Hebrew culture or descending from Hebrew culture (like the people of Shilom):

* ""Thus saith the Lord"" (Messenger Form)
* ""Thus hath he commanded me, saying"" (Revelation Form)
* ""Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord"" (Messenger Form)
* ""Wo be unto this people"" (Woe Oracle)

After this initial message is delivered, we then see more parallels (purposely framed by the abridger, Mormon) between Moses and Abinadi:

|Pharaoh & Moses|Noah & Abinadi|
|:-|:-|
|Moses initially flees for his life since Pharaoh seeks to slay him (Ex. 2:15)|Abinadi initially escapes when the people and King Noah seek to slay him (Ex. Mosiah 11:26,28)|
|Pharaoh rejects the Lord's authority, saying, ""Who is the Lord..."" (Ex. 5:2)|King Noah rejects the Lord's authority, saying, ""Who is the Lord...""|
|Pharaoh hardens his heart (Ex. 7:13, JST)|King Noah hardens his heart (Mosiah 11:29)|
|Moses is commanded by the Lord to return from exile and preach to Pharaoh (Ex. 7:1-2)|Abinadi is commanded to return from exile and preach to the people (Mosiah 12:1)|

# Mosiah 12:1-17

After two years, Abinadi returns to the city by commandment of the Lord to preach unto the people. There is a possibility that he returned to preach *specifically at the celebration of Pentecost*. The Pentecost was, prior to the New Testament, a Jewish yearly celebration of *the giving of the Ten Commandments to Moses and the chidlren of Israel*. Such a gathering would have given Abinadi an audience for his preaching, and its themes align with the themes of Abinadi's message (as we will see).

We start by illustrating more parallels between Moses and Abinadi:

|Pharaoh & Moses|Noah & Abinadi|
|:-|:-|
|Upon returning to Pharoah, Moses prophesies of and delivers a series of plagues (including famine, pestilence, hail, fire, insects) unless Pharaoh repents (Ex. 7-10)|Upon returning to Shilom, Abinadi prophesies of a series of plagues (including famine, pestilence, hail, fire, insects) unless the people repent (Mosiah 12:1-8)|
|Because of the afflictions, Pharoah will eventually acknowledge the Lord (Ex. 7:5,17)|Because of the afflictions, King Noah will eventually acknowledge the Lord (Mosiah 12:3)|
|Moses challenges the wise men and sorcerers of Pharaoh (Ex. 7:8-12)|Abinadi challenges the wicked priests of King Noah (Mosiah 12:25-29)|

Again, this language is filled with strong prophetic speech forms, this time a Hebraism
known as the ""simile curse"":
*   ""the life of king Noah shall be valued even
as a garment in a hot furnace"" (v. 3)
*   ""thou shalt be as a stalk, even as a dry stalk of the field, which is run
    over by the beasts and trodden under foot"" (v. 11)
*   ""thou shalt be as the blossoms of a thistle, which, when it is fully ripe,
    if the wind bloweth, it is driven forth upon the face of the land"" (v. 12)

When the people bind Abinadi and take him before the king, they tell King Noah
about all of the curses‚Äìincluding a prophesy of their future bondage‚ÄìAbinadi has
placed upon King Noah and the people if they do not repent. In justifying their
iniquities and dismissing Abinadi's charges, they say, ""And now, O king, behold,
we are guiltless, and thou, O king, hast not sinned; this man has lied concerning
you, and he has prophesied in vain. And behold, we are strong,
**we shall not come into bondage, or be taken captive by our enemies; yea, and
thou has prospered in the land, and thou shalt also prosper**"" (Mosiah 12:15).

They are citing (and misapplying) as justification the promise that Lehi received from the Lord:
""Inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem
shall keep his commandments, **they shall prosper upon the face of this land**;
and they shall be kept from all other nations, that they may possess this land
unto themselves. And if it so be that they shall keep his commandments they
shall be blessed upon the face of this land, and **there shall be none to molest
them, nor to take away the land of their inheritance; and they shall dwell
safely forever**"" (2 Nephi 1:9). Remember, the people of Limhi (this people
living in Shilom) left Zarahemla and returned to the land of the first inheritance,
where Nephi landed‚Äìthey see themselves as the inheritors of Lehi's promise.

The Lord's promise is that *if* the people together are righteous, *then* they *as a people together*
shall prosper. However, these people speaking to Noah apply it individually to
Noah, essentially saying, ""*If* you personally have prospered, according to
this promise of the Lord, *then* you personally must be righteous. Thus, according
to the previous promises of the Lord, there is *no way* we can be led into bondage
and Abinadi must be lying."" Not only is this a misapplication of logic (A
implying B does not necessarily mean that B implies A), it is a misunderstanding of the
blessing: the Lord's promise was not about individuals (since sometimes righteous
individuals are poor), but about societies that will be collectively righteous.

(Note that I'm not saying the Lord doesn't also prosper righteous individuals;
this happens sometimes too. I'm saying that Lehi's promise was to his
descendants as a people, to the Nephites and/or Lamanites as a society, not
to Lehi or Nephi specifically.)

In contrast, extreme wealth inequality and the prospering of only a few
individuals in a society‚Äìlike that seen under King Noah‚Äìis actually a sign of
*wickedness* (as preached by many Old Testament, Book of Mormon, and New
Testament prophets).

# Mosiah 12:18 - 13:26

Just as Moses challenged the power, knowledge, and authority of the wise men and sorcerers of Pharaoh, Abinadi directly challenges the power, knowledge, and authority of the wicked priests of King Noah.

The ordeal is started when, after being imprisoned for his prophecies against the people, the priests of King Noah tell the king to bring Abinadi before him so that they may question him. Their questioning starts by quoting Isaiah 52:7-10 to Abinadi, and asking him what those words mean:

""How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings; that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth;

Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye when the Lord shall bring again Zion;

Break forth into joy; sing together ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem;

The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations, and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God?""

Why these words? The people of Zeniff (the generation before the people of King Noah) left the land of Zarahemla to return back *up* to the land of Nephi ‚Äì Shilom was in the mountains and hills, as compared to where they had lived before. In essence, these wicked priests were saying, ""Why are you preaching that we are a wicked people when the scriptures call our feet beautiful? We are preaching good tidings unto the people ‚Äì we teach them the law of Moses. Why all of this doom-and-gloom that you preach? You are clearly in the wrong for calling us to repentance.""

Abinadi then begins his challenge: ""Are you *priests*, and pretend to teach this people, and to understand the spirit of prophesying, and yet desire to know of me what these things mean?"" (12:25). This then becomes the theme of his challenge to them: the priests do not understand the scriptures, especially the Law of Moses, and Abinadi is going to explain the scriptures and the law of Moses to them.

He asks them, ""What teach ye this people?"" (12:27).

They answer, ""The Law of Moses"" (12:28). Again, Moses and the law given to him are a theme of this interaction between Abinadi and the priests of King Noah. In total, the name ""Moses"" is used 16 times from Mosiah 12:28-16:15, 15 of which are by Abinadi and 1 of which is by the abridger, Mormon.

Abinadi replies, ""If ye teach the law of Moses, why do ye not keep it?"" (12:29) and then proceeds to list their sins, especially pride, wealth-seeking, sexual immorality, and leading the people astray.

Abinadi then challenges them again: ""And what know ye concerning the law of Moses? Doth salvation come by the law of Moses? What say ye?"" (12:31).

The priests respond that salvation does come by the law of Moses.

Abinadi then says, ""I know if ye keep the commandments of God ye shall be saved; yea, if ye keep the commandments which the Lord delivered unto Moses in the mount of Sinai, saying..."" (12:33) and then quotes two of the Ten Commandments. If Abinadi came at the time of Pentecost, then this is the exact occasion these people are celebrating: the time when the Lord delivered unto Moses the commandments at Sinai. Thus, Abinadi would be referencing the festival, in essence, saying, ""Don't you remember the whole point of this party you are throwing right now? You are forgetting why we have this festival in the first place.""

The king then, being angry with Abinadi, tells his priests to slay Abinadi, but Abinadi withstands them, saying, ""Touch me not, for God shall smite you if ye lay your hands upon me, for I have not delivered the message which the Lord sent me to deliver; neither have I told you that which ye requested that I should tell \[referring to the requested interpretation of Isaiah 52:7-10\]; therefore, God will not suffer that I shall be destroyed at this time"" (13:3).

Then, Mormon records that ""the people of king Noah durst not lay their hands on \[Abinadi\], for the Spirit of the Lord was upon him; and *his face shone with exceeding luster, even as Moses' did while in the mount of Sinai, while speaking with the Lord*"" (13:5). (Again, this is a powerful and divine reference to the events being celebrated at the Pentecost festival. Now, it isn't just Abinadi or Mormon drawing the parallels to Moses: God Himself, by resting that light upon Abinadi, is writing the parallel.)

And *with power and authority*, he then reads to them ""the remainder of the \[ten\] commandments of God"". The Ten Commandments ""are not written in \[the priests'\] hearts"", because instead of studying and teaching the scriptures as they ought to have been, they ""have studied and taught iniquity the most part of \[their\] lives"" (13:11).

Once more, we see more parallels between Moses and Abinadi:

|Pharaoh & Moses|Noah & Abinadi|
|:-|:-|
|Moses' face shines when he came down from Sinai with the two tables of testimony from the Lord for the people of Israel (Ex. 34:29-30)|Abinadi's face shines as he delivers his message to King Noah and his priests (Mosiah 13:5)|
|The people of Israel are afraid to approach Moses because his face shines (Ex. 34:30)|The priests of King Noah are afraid to lay their hands on him because of his words and because his face shines (Mosiah 13:5)|
|Moses delivers the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20, 34)|Abinadi delivers the Ten Commandments (Mosiah 12:35-36, 13:12-24)|
|Moses speaks to a stiff-necked people (Ex. 32:9)|Abinadi speaks to a stiff-necked people (Mosiah 13:29)|

Abinadi finishes delivering the Ten Commandments by saying, ""Have ye taught this people that they should observe to do all these things for to keep these commandments? I say unto you, Nay"" (13:25-26).

# Mosiah 13:27-35

Abinadi then starts to lay the seeds that connect the law of Moses (and perhaps the Pentecost festival) and the passages from Isaiah he was asked about earlier. After reciting to them the Law of Moses, he reminds the priests of their earlier statement that salvation comes by the law of Moses:

""And now ye have said that salvation cometh by the law of Moses \[part of which he just read to them\]; I say unto you that it is expedient that ye should keep the law of Moses as yet; but I say unto you that the time shall come when it shall no more be expedient to keep the law of Moses.

And moreover, I say unto you, that salvation doth not come by the law alone; and were it not for *the atonement which God himself shall make for the sins and iniquities of his people* that they must unavoidably perish, notwithstanding the law of Moses"" (13:27-28)

In addition to the Ten Commandments, the Law of Moses required a series of strict ordinances, rituals, and observances that had to be kept strictly. One of these was the *atonement* sacrifice: a person would present a sacrificial animal, one without blemish, to be killed; the animal symbolically took the sins of the person and was killed on their behalf, reconciling the individual back to Jehovah. The person *made* an atonement sacrifice.

Therefore, Abinadi is saying that this strict law means nothing, unless God Himself offers an atoning sacrifice, something that is so great it will cover the sins of all his people, not just one person and not just for one sin but for all sins.

In Abinadi's words, the law of Moses and all its ordinances ""were types of things to come"" (13:31): they were a symbol pointing forward to the great atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.

He then says that the children of Israel and the Jews in Jerusalem did also not understand the law ""and this because of the hardness of their hearts"" (13:32), implying that the priests of King Noah *also* do not understand the Law of Moses.

""For behold, did not Moses prophecy unto them concerning the coming of the Messiah, and that God should redeem his people? Yea, and even all the prophets who have prophesied ever since the world began‚Äìhave they not spoken more or less concerning these things?

Have they not said that God himself should come down amng the children of men, and take upon him the form of man, and go forth in mighty power upon the face of the earth?

Yea, and have they not said also that he should bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, and that he, himself, should be oppressed and afflicted?"" (13:33-35).

# Mosiah 14 - 15:31

Now Abinadi starts to turn back more directly to answer the previous question posed by the priests concerning the meaning of Isaiah 52:7-10. Of course, what is a great technique for understanding a passage? You *look at its context.* So, what does Abinadi do to explain the meaning of Isaiah 52? He recites to them the content of Isaiah 53, a Messianic prophecy:

""Yea, even doth not Isaiah say: Who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?

For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground; he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him.

He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows; yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

All we, like sheep, have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.

He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he opened not his mouth.

He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall declare his generation? For he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgressions of my people was he stricken.

And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.

Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him; he hath put him to grief; when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand.

He shall see the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and made intercession for the transgressors."" (Mosiah 14)

He then, in beautiful language, explains Isaiah 53 by:

* expounding on the relationship between the Father and the Son (15:1-5);
* explaining that the Son will be, as Isaiah said, oppressed and afflicted (15:5) and led ""as a sheep before the shearer is dumb so he opened not his mouth"" (15:6) and slain (15:7) so that death and iniquity may be defeated.

He then, echoing the words of Isaiah in Chapter 53, asks, ""Who shall declare his generation?"" and answers his own question and, simultaneously, the priests' question concerning Isaiah 52:

""All the holy prophets who have prophesied concerning the coming of the Lord... all those who have hearkened unto their words, and beleived that the Lord would redeem his people, and have looked forward to that day for a remission of their sins... the prophets, every one that has opened his mouth to prophesy, that has not fallen into transgression, I mean all the holy prophets ever since the world began...

**These** are they who have published peace, who have brought good tidings of good, who have published salvation; and said unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!

And O how beautiful upon the mountains were **their** feet!

And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are **the feet of those that are still publishing peace**!

And again, how beautiful upon the mountains are **the feet of those who shall hereafter publish peace**, yea, from this time henceforth and forever!

And behold, I say unto you, this is not all. For O how beautiful upon the mountains are \*\*the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that is the founder of peace, yea, even the Lord, who has redeemed his people; yea, him who has granted salvation unto his people"" (Mosiah 15:11-18).

In other words, Abinadi is refuting their interpretation of Isaiah 52: these verses aren't about them; they are about Christ and all those who preach and follow Christ.

He then expounds on what ""the salvation of our God"" (Isaiah 52:10) actually is: that Christ ""has broken the bands of death"" (Mosiah 15:23) and ""all those that have believed in \[the words of the prophets\], or all those that have kept the commandments of God, shall come forth in the first resurrection"" (Mosiah 15:22).

But, salvation does not come to those ""that rebel against him and die in their sins"", those ""that have wilfully rebelled against God, that have known the commandments of God, and would not keep them; these are they that have no part int the first resurrection"" (15:26); in other words, the *exact type of people that King Noah and his priests are*: people who know the law and who should know better. This is why Abinadi then challenges them and says, ""Therefore ought ye not to tremble?"" because they know, as he does, that they are wilfully rebelling against God.

Then, to tie it all back together, he connects his words to Isaiah 52:8-10:

""...the time shall come that the salvation of the Lord shall be declared to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.

Yea, Lord, thy watchmen shall lift up their voice; with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when the Lord shall bring again Zion.

Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Lord hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.

The Lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God."" (Mosiah 15:28-31)

# Mosiah 16:1-15

After quoting to them again the words of Isaiah 52, he repeats the last idea of Isaiah's words to them:

""The time shall come when all shall see the salvation of the Lord; when every nation, kindred, tongue, and people shall see eye to eye and shall confess before God that his judgments are just."" (16:2)

He then expounds upon the state of the wicked after death, teaches the Fall of Adam and Eve, and the necessity of the Redemption and Resurrection of Christ; that is, he concludes his challenge and sermon to the priests by teaching them the Plan of Salvation.

A defining feature of this sermon is that Abinadi speaks ""of things to come as though they had already come"" (16:6); that is, he speaks in the present or past tense about future events (e.g., the redemption, the resurrection, etc.). This is another powerful Hebraic prophetic speech form, known as the ""prophetic perfect tense""; it is used by many Old Testament prophets when they speak of future events. Why? Because having received revelation concerning those events, their faith and knowledge of such events is as plain as if it already has happened to them. To them, Jesus might as well have already come, that is how real His Atonement is to them. That aspect of the future is just as matter of fact as the present or past.

Finally, Abinadi ties it all back together to the big theme: the priests do not understand, teach, or live according to the Law of Moses, and unless they repent, they will not be saved by the redemption of Christ.

""And now, ought ye not to tremble and repent of your sins, and remember that only in and through Christ ye can be saved?

Therefore, if ye teach the law of Moses, also teach that it is a shadow of those things which are to come‚Äì

Teach them that redemption cometh through Christ the Lord, who is the very Eternal Father. Amen."" (16:13-15)

# Mosiah 17:1-20

Abinadi's sermon has a lasting impact on one of the high priests, Alma, who believes Abinadi's words and pleads with the king to not be angry with Abinadi and let him depart in peace. (Again, the impact of Abinadi's sermon cannot be understated: Alma becomes the righteous leader of the Church, authorized with the priesthood to perform ordinances and set apart other leaders in the Church. His descendants are consistently those that lead the Nephites in the ways of the Lord until and after the coming of Christ.)

King Noah casts out Alma, who flees so that he will not be slain. *It is because of Alma that we have this record of Abinadi at all, as he is the one who ""did write all the words which Abinadi had spoken""* (17:4).

King Noah then casts Abinadi into prison (seeing as how he had finished his message) for three days. (Notably, the length of the Pentecost Festival is *also* three days.)

After counseling with his priests, King Noah has Abinadi brought before them to stand trial. The priests have found a way, under the Law of Moses, to condemn Abinadi to death: they accuse him of blasphemy, which, under the Law of Moses, is punishable by death (Leviticus 24:11-16).

""Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death. For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people."" (17:7-8)

Notice that the condition of Abinadi's acquittal is not that he repeal the words he said about God; the priests don't actually care about that trumped up charge. They instead care about the *curses* he has placed on them and prophesied of them, that they will be scourged, and plagued, and burned, etc. The ancient people took curses very seriously, and if Abinadi had the power to place a curse, only he could repeal it.

He refutes them once more: ""I will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you, concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands. Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day"" (17:9-10).

This strikes fear into the heart of King Noah. He knows that the charges of blasphemy are false, and that if he goes through with this, it will be murder, ""for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him"" (17:11).

However, the priests then quickly come up with another charge: ""He has reviled the king"" (17:12). This is the charge they will put him to death for, for speaking ill of the king. And King Noah acquiesces, is stirred up in anger against Abinadi and orders him to be killed.

The priests then take Abinadi, bind him, scourge him with faggots (bundles of wood to be burned), and scorch him with fire. Notice here, once more, the references to the story of Moses: because Abinadi preached to them using the Law of Moses, and shone like Moses, and spoke of Moses to testify of their iniquities, (and all possibly during the Pentecost celebration) they place him *in a burning bush*.

As the flames scorch him, Abinadi solidifies the curse and prophesies that, just as he is killed, so will the king die too: ""And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire"" (17:18). This prophesy later comes true, as King Noah is hunted and burned ""unto death by fire"" (Mosiah 19:20). This represents the final comparison between Moses' story and Abinadi's story:

|Pharaoh & Moses|Noah & Abinadi|
|:-|:-|
|Just as Pharaoh had the sons of the Hebrews cast into the river to drown (Ex. 1:22), he and his army drowned in the depths of the Red Sea (Ex. 14:27-8).|Just as King Noah burned Abinadi alive (Mosiah 17:14-20), he was killed through death by fire (Mosiah 19:20).|

Abinadi then exclaims, ""O God, receive my soul,"" and dies, ""because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death"" (Mosiah 17:20).

# Abinadi: A Type and Shadow himself of Christ

Abinadi preached that the Law of Moses was a type and shadow of Christ. It's not hard to see that Abinadi's own death was *also* a type and shadow of Christ:

|Abinadi's death|Christ's death|
|:-|:-|
|Abinadi testified to the wicked high priests of Shilom of their iniquities.|Christ testified to the wicked priests of the Jews of their iniqiuities.|
|Abinadi is placed on trial and accused of blasphemy for preaching that God would come down among the children of men.|Christ is placed on trial and accused of blapshemy for preaching that He is God, and He came down among the children of men.|
|Abinadi is almost released by King Noah, out of fear of the consequences.|Christ is almost released by Pilate, out of fear of the consequences.|
|The priests convinced King Noah to kill him anyways.|The people (and priests in particular) convinced Pilate to deliver Christ to be killed.|
|Abinadi is scourged and beaten prior to his death.|Christ is scourged and beaten prior to his death.|
|Abinadi seals the truth of his words by his death.|Christ seals the truth of his words by his death (Hebrews 9:16-17).|",15 May 2024 06:39:01,reddit

642,https://www.reddit.com/r/CliqueSupport/comments/1crypp6/318_welcomebacktotrench/,318_WelcomeBackToTrench,"It has been a lot. More than it has ever been in my life. I made it out alive. I made it out alive from the biggest battle, I could have ever imagined. I was pretty sure, it would take the best of me, I was committed to that, it would take me. I was pretty sure, I would never write a letter again. I was pretty sure, I would not breathe again.

I was in somewhere else for a long while.

And now I'm in here. Back in here, back in Trench.

I'm sorry, my frens, that I have been distant. I love your torches over here, the fact you are in here.

I heard this song some weeks ago from distance. In the beginning it repeats a sentece in different languages. The lines goes like

*Diese kleine heimliche Insel hat mich zu einer Waffe gemacht*  
*Wir glauben beide*  
*Cette petite √Æle √©trange a fait de moi une arme*  
*Nous croyons tous les deux que nous pouvons*  
*L'utiliser pour changer l'√©lan de cette guerre)Esta peque√±a isla espeluznante me ha convertido en un arma*  
*Ambos creemos que podemos usarla para cambiar el impulso de esta guerra*

I believe, it all means that ""this secret little island turned me into a weapon. We both believe, we can use it to change the momentum of this war.""

In my language, which I have always known, it would be ""T√§m√§ pieni salainen saari teki minusta aseen. Me molemmat uskomme, ett√§ sit√§ voi k√§ytt√§√§ sodank√§ynnin muuttumiseen.""

Leaves, trees and grass has turned into green. Sky is more blue and the air is filled with more dust to breathe. Dandelions are reborning from the weirdest places I could ever expect them to do so.

It feels like they didn't do that last year, like they skipped it. Did I skip it? This year, they are more yellow, more green, more dusty than ever before. The sky is more open than ever before.

I didn't understood that I'm in Trench again. Until this day. I have been away from everywhere for so long. I believe, that that secret little island turned me into a weapon. We both believe, we can use it to change the mometum of this war. Still not sure, if that was their message, but I'm feeling it. But yeah. Welcome back to Trench. I wrote a song few weeks ago, a way before these dandelions showed up.

*""How are you doing?""*¬†  
*thanks, for not asking,*¬†  
*I just visited your collegue*  
*told her ""I might have a colic*  
*but otherwise, I'm at my peak""*  
*she looked at me with inch of pity*  
*or then it was just me*  
*in a slight problem of reflection*¬†  
*on her synthetic domination*

*I'm bothered by expect to behave at my age*

*when today I was too tired to even do my lace*¬†

*I wouldn't like to care if I left behind my left Vans*

*but now I know I would have to buy new shoes*

*and there's no chance, I would learn to run over again*

*especially when I would have to do it with this shame*

¬†*It was my time, to pick up my fight*  
*it was dark and cold, in the night*¬†  
*your silver dashes gave me the light*  
*you looked like a bee when you cried*  
*through your lences while I prayed,*¬†  
*""please don't let anyone tell me I didn't try""*  
*and you said, ""it doesn't matter, anyway*  
*you have known it all in each of your ruins,*¬†  
*and I have told it to you thousand of times,*¬†  
*don't look at them*  
*they don't know a shit*  
*look at me instead,*¬†  
*let's sit with it.""*¬†

*I've been running*  
*I've been running*  
*stop, repeat*

*I taste on my tongue, drop of drool*  
*knowing damn well, I could suck a pool*  
*of it, if it*¬†  
*has no chlorine in it*¬†  
*ironic, innit?*¬†  
*when we know I like to spit*  
*instead of sucking it up,*¬†  
*what it even means, a thug?*¬†

*So, dad, are you proud of me now?*¬†

*Mom, is this where you pointed your arrow? (at)*

*Brother do you think you know me so well,*

*is it still me, and red dead redemption and dwell?*

*It was my time, to pick up my fight*  
*it was dark and cold, in the night*¬†  
*your silver dashes gave me the light*  
*you looked like a bee when you cried*  
*through your lences while I prayed,*¬†  
*""please don't let anyone tell me I didn't try""*  
*and you said, ""it doesn't matter, anyway*  
*you have known it all in each of your ruins,*¬†  
*and I have told it to you thousand of times,*¬†  
*don't look at them*  
*they don't know a shit*  
*look at me instead,*¬†  
*let's sit with it.""*¬†

¬†*I've been running*  
*I've been running*  
*stop, play*

¬†*Wondering down the streets*¬†  
*wandering through my schemes*¬†  
*I wasn't fine with most of the things*  
*at the ends of the my past's strings*  
*I let it go, my palms still bleed*¬†  
*but now I see, I need to feed*¬†  
*myself, pay my bills if I really care about*  
*if I actually agree with the plot*

*I'm fighting in between paying for new you*¬†

*or buying the pair of socks and few*

*slices of cheese, instead*

¬†*It was my time, to pick up my fight*  
*it was dark and cold, in the night*¬†  
*your silver dashes gave me the light*  
*you looked like a bee when you cried*  
*through your lences while I prayed,*¬†  
*""please don't let anyone tell me I didn't try""*  
*and you said, ""it doesn't matter, anyway*  
*you have known it all in each of your ruins,*¬†  
*and I have told it to you thousand of times,*¬†  
*don't look at them*  
*they don't know a shit*  
*look at me instead,*¬†  
*let's sit with it."" '*

¬†*What if I don't wanna sit anyway,*  
*I'm running again, straight into the forest*  
*well, I don't want to sit at least today*  
*each tree looks the same, I look for thickest*  
*to run directly against*  
*so I can pass out and resist*  
*moving on*  
*come on*¬†  
*tell me one more time*¬†  
*""it's time to sit, my friend""*

*On rewind*

*Drowning in your honey*

*like I never need to obey*

¬†*It has always been my time, always picking my fight*  
*it is always dark and cold, it is always the night*  
*your silver dashes grew along, in a different light*  
*someone like you will always look like a bee and cry*  
*someone like me will always circle and think they didn't even try*  
*and the dying bees will keep telling it;*¬†

*""are you done running from today? let's sit with it,*

*oh you are flying, by the dangerous bend symbol again?*¬†

*for who you gave the remote, on your last refrain?""*

¬†

*There's the thickest tree with the marks of destruction*

*before I collapse, I wonder how bees works in isolation*

*buzzz.....*¬†

¬†

*Please, tell me again, that old story you have¬†""*

I miss B. She was something else. But I know it is my time to stand up again, and look at myself as I am, from the reflection of the puddle, here in Trench. It is my time to come back, and overtake my former self.

B always told me, that I have everything I need, it all is built inside me. It is hard to believe, when I'm cold at nights, but I know she is correct. I know she is correct, because I have to. I was giving up, and with B I found it again. We lit my torch again. And she made me understood, why I need to return to Trench. I needed to return in here. *I will reach my hand above the tide, for one more time.*

My song is written for B. I need to stand in here, and wait for the torches, my responsability is to lit up my torch. We are in here. Like we have always been.

Welcome back to Trench, A. Welcome back to Trench, with all of it's terror, insecurities, colours and sounds. And torches. I'm still alive.

Are you here with me? Are you still alive out there?

643,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1crxabo/second_take_at_a_subclass_fantasy/,Second Take at a Subclass Fantasy,"Im bored. Heres a silly idea to dislike.

Subclass Themes
========
With the darkness subclasses being based on mental states, I took the ideology of the id, ego, and super ego to be the darkness elements. I took the ego to be stasis as you are forcing your will into reality and overriding the will of others. I understood the superego to be strand. Understanding the world around you, the complexity and the conections of it all, the restrictions and necessity of reality. That leaves the id. Desires and instinct. Fantasies and dreams. Compulsions.

Another theme that had to be included was that of opposition. Strand is about creation and void is about absence. Solar and stasis, while much more complicated than fire and ice, do oppose each other in more meaningful ways. Arc is all about mobility, energy, adapting, and change. The opposite would be complacency. Sloth. Giving in to your desires.

The last requirements would be to have anti-barrier perks and anti-overload perks. This was the simplest and could be flavored in any which way, with anti barrier having some sort of buff, and anti overload having some sort of debuff.

With this I introduce Soul, a form of darkness that takes the shape of a dark red liquid. Names could all use some work.

Verbs
=======
Seethe (Debuff): Soul seeps into enemies minds revealing their anger. Form of cc that has non-boss units attack nearby enemies. Combatants affected cant discern between friend or foe. Enemy guardians afflicted have friendly fire enabled and increased recoil. Reticles will slowly shift towards allies within ? meters.

Despair (Debuff): Soul clouds your head. Prevents any health gain during affliction. Enemies take damage over time. Ends with a burst of damage. Strong against overloads.

Wrath (Buff): Release your inner fury. Weapons are empowered dealing increased damage based on targets missing health. Capped at 35%. Strong against Barrier champions.

Envy (Buff): Enemy accuracy towards buffed targets is reduced based on distance. Closer enemies are more likely to miss shots. Melee damage received is reduced. 

Harrow (Class Pickup): Soul matter coalesces on the floor in large red pools after killing debuffed targets. Enemies standing on Harrow take minor damage. Interacts with aspects and fragments. Armor charge works off time spent on Harrow.

Disclaimer
======
I was more focused on ideology. I have yet to refine ideas but aspects, melees, and supers allow for a lot of creativity of which i am lacking atm. If you have any suggestions, changes or anything let me know. Change the verbs or the whole damn thing, just want any sort of discussion. No its not serious nor do I think there is any chance of this.

Hunter
==========
Mind Tap (Melee): 
Throw an ice pick. Headshots cause targets to Seethe. Bodyshots cause Despair.

Merciless (Aspect): 
While Wrathful heal for a very small portion of the damage dealt to Despairing targets. Despair will spread between close enemies.

Paranoia (Aspect): 
Dodging while standing on Harrow puddles lets the hunter dissolve into Soul matter becoming untargetable, gain heavy damage resist, and be able to move through units. While in Paranoia gain Wrathful. Gain 200% increased melee regen and movement speed. Offensive actions pull you out. Displayed as large waves moving inside.

Paint it Red (Aspect): 
Damaging Despairing targets releases Harrow. Has a short cooldown.

Hemophobia (Super):
Explode into a massive puddle of Soul matter leaving Harrow around you. Does increased Harrow damage. Light attack throws ice picks that cause despair. Deals more damage to targets on Harrow. Heavy Attack dashes forward dealing light damage. Dodge refreshes on use.

Titan
=========
Menacing Strike(Melee): 
Summon a massive maw from your hand inflicting Despair in a small aoe. Hits grant Wrath.

Unholy Soul (Aspect): 
Standing in Harrow puddles slowly provides health and Envy. Kills on Harrow refresh the duration and increase the size of the pool.

Terror (Aspect): 
Soul kills charge up a meter. When fully charged your next powered melee will deal 3x damage, have much more range, grant damage resistance, and grant Envy for a brief period. Melee charge is separate from the standard (think gunpowder gamble).

Finality (Aspect): 
Powered melee final blows while Wrathful refresh 90% of melee energy. Using your aerial move will slam down releasing Harrow and refilling active weapons. Costs melee energy.

Sorrow (Super): 
Whip around chains before tossing them at the target enemy. Enemy erupts in massive damage Despairing all nearby combatants and releasing Harrow. After a delay the target erupts again, taking damage based on the damage taken during the super.

Warlock
==========
Dread (Melee): 
Shoot forward a cloud, raining and Despairing all enemies hit along the way. At max distance or on large targets the cloud lingers.

Agnosiophobia (Aspect): 
While grounded; press your air move to vanish, reappearing at a Harrow covered point of your choice. Emerging and departing causes a Despairing and Envious aoe. Large amounts of Harrow are released at the point that you left. Standing on Harrow gives you 100% grenade regen rate.

Mind Flayer (Aspect): 
Seething lasts longer on enemies. Seething enemies that die near you release parasites that travel to all unaffiliated enemies standing in connected Harrow.

Tides of War (Aspect):
Activating melee will release a tsunami of Harrow in an aoe a bit larger than consecration. Enemies hit by the raging wave take massive damage and are Seethed. Wave leaves Harrow in its wake.

Beast Within (Super): Coat yourself in Soul Matter and emerge in a different form. A massive centipede with increased movement speed and trample damage. Light attack stops you, before lunging at enemies. Heavy attack is a massive charged leap. If charged all the way gain distance and release Harrow where you land. Press grenade to spit Despair at enemies 

Grenades
========
Harrow Grenade: Can bounce. On detonation releases Harrow. Enemies hit will leave Harrow in their wake.

Bunkering Grenade: Sticks to surfaces but not enemies. When deployed projects a ring. Allies standing within the ring gain Envy. Enemies within Despair.

Winding Grenade: On hitting an enemy or surface releases 3 bolts, quickly striking the nearest enemies in rage.  Enemies hit Seethe.

648,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1crt9gc/when_are_we_gonna_see_some_love_for_bows/,When are we gonna see some love for bows?,"Of the various ways to fight in Cyberpunk Red, Archery feels the most lackluster and forgotten, only ever used if you're playing ELO, as your ELO character.

Shoulder arms - Most Versatile weapon type, weapons for every range band, powerful exotics

Handguns - Concealable, Tons upon tons of Exotics

Heavy Weapons - Best consistent damage, AOE

Autofire - Highest max damage (Helix), crowd control capabilities, Cheat ammo cost with junk/small game ammo.

Melee Weapons - 1/2 armor, fantastic exotics with great secondary effects

Thrown Weapons - 1/2 armor at range, can also be used in melee with melee weapons skill, 

Grenades - Fantastic AOE damage, and utility options

Brawling - Grapple, Human shield, Choke, Disarm, 

Martial Arts - Kip-up, unique powerful moves that can completely turn the tide of a fight, borg MA can be done at character generation and is uber powerful.

Archery - Silent, change ammo on the fly, no reload, forgiving range bands

Seems like Archery has its niche? Well there's shoulder arms and handguns that are silent, there are shoulderarms and handguns that can switch ammo on the fly, and if you're a single shot build when are you ever going to need to reload your AR? And the range bands? AR with shotgun underbarrel says hello.

Top it all off with the lack of RAW Archery exotics (only the survivalist that i'm aware of) and the lack of customization with attachments, and it feels like Archery is practically pointless to ever put points into.

R-Tal, please make Archery good. Or at least give us something better than we have. I'm begging you.",14 May 2024 10:16:28,reddit
649,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1crrna5/the_black_shadow/,The Black Shadow,"English Translation:
In the bustling heart of a vibrant city, a covert operative named Yusuf stood out amidst the throngs of ordinary citizens. Possessing exceptional combat skills and a razor-sharp intellect, Yusuf was no ordinary agent. His latest mission, however, was his most challenging yet: to infiltrate the notorious international criminal organization, Black Shadow, and retrieve crucial information about an impending arms deal.

Under the cloak of a dark night, Yusuf embarked on his perilous journey, skillfully navigating his way into Black Shadow's clandestine headquarters. The air crackled with tension, danger lurking around every corner. With swift, precise movements, Yusuf employed his hand-to-hand combat expertise to neutralize the guards who attempted to thwart his progress.

Upon reaching the information vault deep within the organization's lair, Yusuf found himself face to face with the mastermind behind Black Shadow's operations, the formidable Red Lion. Renowned for his brute strength and unparalleled fighting prowess, the Red Lion posed a formidable challenge.
A fierce battle ensued, each combatant unleashing the full extent of their skills and might. Despite the Red Lion's formidable reputation, Yusuf's unwavering determination and strategic brilliance gradually turned the tide in his favor.

Emerging victorious from the intense confrontation, Yusuf secured the coveted information. However, before he could make his escape, he stumbled upon Black Shadow's sinister plot to launch a devastating attack on a major city. With no time to lose, Yusuf resolved to thwart the organization's nefarious plans himself.

As time relentlessly ticked away and danger lurked at every turn, would Yusuf succeed in foiling Black Shadow's treacherous scheme and save the city from imminent catastrophe?

Here is my playthrough so far, in the form of AAR Chronicle.","[House Renart: \\""As Clever as a Fox\\""](https://preview.redd.it/bi6ifd4rda0d1.png?width=247&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b2780a5c06e22c42f128108177dbbd43c3d5c1f)

# Duke Otger 'the Brute' of Lausitz

[It's him, John Crusader-Kings-3](https://preview.redd.it/f9a9tq5wda0d1.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1eb1d0fe57e2eb5540991ca4e48e19d983ee9c1)

**Otger I Renart** (6 March 1040 - 28 February 1101) was the count of Spreewall and the Duke of Lausitz, and the founder of the Renart dynasty. A dastardly count, he pursued any way to gain power in the lands of the Saxons.

Otger was known to be a stubborn and yet brave man, with a vengeful streak. This was due to the fact that his brother was killed by Jakob Barenburg of Lubsko when he was a mere infant. Otger grew up under the tutelage of his mother, becoming a well read warrior in his own right.

At the age of 16, he fell in love with Hersent Louve, a minor noble lady within his court, and they married. They would have a daughter who would eventually marry Edgar Wessex. For a while, peace remained in Lausitz, but Otger, the wily fox, would see to it that he would move things to get revenge on Jakob Barenburg.

15 September, 1066, Otger went to war with the County of Wittenberg, held by Count Thimo, to press a claim over the castle and lands there. He would defeat Count Thimo at the Battle of Wittenberg in 21 February of 1067, and in May became the ruler of Wittenburg.

On 28 July 1067, his eldest son Otger was born. In September, Count Jakob Barenburg would be poisoned on the 15th of December, 1067, and for many generations his death was seen as mysterious. Recent historical opinion, however, blames Otger I for the death.

The following year, Otger went to war with Jakob Barenburg‚Äôs daughter, Brigida, who was seeing instability in her realm following the untimely death with her father. Otger‚Äôs forces defeated Brigida at the Battle of Lubsko, but two years of siege meant minor skirmishes, and Otger would only gain victory in August of 1070 AD.

Otger was a participant in defending the realm Duke Theoderic of Angria who was fighting off his own counts in 1076. Otger would lose the battle of L√ºneburg against Countess Hedwig of G√∂ttingen that year, but Duke Theoderic successfully put down his vassals. It was around that time that Otger was being called ‚Äúthe Brute‚Äù by many of his vassals for his heavy handed way of doing things, as well as his strong physique. The nickname would stick.

Another war for the Count of Gorlitz in 1077-1078 led Otger to acquiring another castle. Him and his knights would defeat the count outside of Gorlitz and overtook the fortress. With many of the castles and lands under his grasp, Otger began to plot to become the duke of Lausitz.

Duke Konrad of Lausitz was relatively young when he came to the throne. In a position of weakness, Otger declared himself the rightful duke of the land of Lausitz. The armies of Count Otger moved towards Juterborg in the winter of 1084. The young Duke Konrad did not give up his throne so easily. Otger commanded the armies, backed by the Duke of Carinthia and the Duke of Angria, whom he created alliance with.

Otger commanded and won the battle of G√∂rlitz against Count Konrad of J√ºterbog on the 31st of July, 1084. He was actually outnumbered during this fight in a battle of 1000 against 1500. He used the positioning of the hills outside of the city to his advantage. Konrad would be captured later by the Duke of Carinthia in August of 1085, and would surrender. Otger would be declared the Duke of Lausitz.

Not even a year later, Konrad rebelled against Otger, seeking to reclaim his power as Duke. The two had small engagements in 1086, most notably the Battle of Gommern in January of 1087. Otger pursued the fleeing Konrad into the spring and would capture him at the Battle of Gorlitz. There, Konrad would be imprisoned, and had his lands revoked.

On the 25th of October, 1090, Duke Otger came to the aid of his ally King William II ‚Äòthe Red‚Äô of England after King Philippe of France went to reclaim Normandy. This would see a defeat for Otger and William the Red. Normandy fell back into French control.

In 1091, Otger became the ruler of the Duchy of Istria after it‚Äôs previous Duke was excommunicated. The title was given to him by Emperor Heinrich V. A similar situation happened in 1096 with the Duchy of Hesse, which was given to Otger as well.

13 March, 1098, Otger came to Duke Hendrik's defense against Duca Tribale Aleardo's dethronement war. Duke Hendrik would manage to fend of Aleardo‚Äôs forces by himself, however, so Otger‚Äôs participation was not needed.

The last three years of Otger‚Äôs reign was relatively peaceful. He hosted a grand wedding for his son Christopher who married into Austria‚Äôs Babenburg family. Otger would pass away on the 28th of February, 1101, from old age. His primary title of Lausitz would pass onto his son Otger, while the Duchy of Istria went to his son Ludwig and Hesse went to his son Christopher.

# King Otger of Poland

[Guy had a massive drinking problem and no sons.](https://preview.redd.it/b11x8nw9ea0d1.png?width=401&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b6b4602eb5742787d741da649aaac54f8f4470)

**King Otger** (July 28, 1067 - July 6th, 1124) was Duke of Lausitz in 1101, and the King of Poland from 1116, until his death in 1124.

In life, Otger was a calm, humble, and zealous man whose only ambition in life was, at first, to rule the Duchy of Lausitz relatively peacefully. Unlike his vengeful father, Otger made a point to not make many enemies. In fact, he was quite good with making friends and even allies in clutch.

He was born on July 28th, 1067 to his father Count Otger and his mother Countess Hersent. He was their second child, and the oldest of his brothers. His upbringing was relatively quiet, with his father Otger having a hands-on approach to his education.

In 1083, he would marry a minor noble from Poland, named Olga. She would, however, die in childbirth with his firstborn daughter Geilana in 1087. This would lead Otger to grow distant with his eldest daughter, who he would eventually disinherit. This was also the point when Otger would begin his horrible habit of alcoholism to cope with his misery. The same year, he made a political alliance with Duchess Gertrude, another minor noble, from Austria.

In 1101, Otger would ascend to the throne of Lausitz (as Otger II) while his brothers became dukes of Istria and Hesse. He would ally with them to secure their places as the dukes over those lands. He would travel on pilgrimage in 1104 as a sign of his piety. He arrived in Colonge on the 25th of April where he dedicated his life to ruling in the Christian ways.

During this, King Casimir of Poland was excommunicated by the Pope for his life of sin. A massive civil war overtook the Polish countryside, dragging German dukes into the conflict. Polish soldiers would raid the Duchy of Lausitz while Otger II was on his pilgrimage. When he returned, he was furious to see what had happened to his lands. He appealed to Pope Urbanus II in hopes that he could get compensation to rebuild some of his lands.¬†

Instead, Pope Urbanus II saw the pious character of Otger, and, knowing he was bordering the Polish lands, offered him the opportunity to step in during the civil war as an intercessor to bring peace and dispose of King Casimir. Otger at first refused this role, believing it was not his place. However, as the civil war dragged on, more and more of Poland grew into turmoil. According to The Renalt Chronicle Otger ‚Äúprayed to God for resolution‚Äù in Poland in 1114, but nothing came.

In the same year, Queen Gertrude would die in her sleep. Otger had been struggling to get a male heir all of his life. Stricken with the grief of his wife dying, and the continuous raids in his lands, Otger became flagellant in order to cope with the stress. Otger believed he was punished by God for his reluctance to act in Poland. Thus, in his zealous nature, he finally rallied his small forces and rode into the southern mountains of Silesia in Janary of 1115, to do the ‚Äúright‚Äù thing.

[Quick, while he's distracted, invade him!](https://preview.redd.it/hszet1sqea0d1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21f55294c36657819a96784ad4a9badd78a33245)

King Casimir was far too distracted by an invasion to the east of him by the Russians to bother with the small forces of Duke Otger that was reported to him. He was busy fighting his brother Witosz Piast for the throne as well. Otger joined Richard Babenburg, Duke of Austria, in Silesia and then marched north into Greater Poland. Many of the castles were occupied by Czibor Piast‚Äôs soldiers and they quickly fell to Otger and Richard‚Äôs forces as they besieged them.

The armies of Witosz were defeated by Casimir in the spring of 1116, where he was imprisoned by his brother. Casimir marched back west towards the armies of Otger and Richard who were driving way the rest of the rebel forces. The rebels disbanded, which gave Otger the opportunity to take further Silesian castles. Eventually, come the late summer of 1116, Duke Otger and King Casimir met each other at Katowice.

The Battle of Katowice was a long engagement, taking several weeks in the early fall of the year. Otger was reported to have an army of 1500 men, while Casimir had an army of 1700 men. It was believed that, at first, Casimir with his slight numerical advantage would win. However, the Duke of Austria came from the south later into the engagement and swayed the tide. Casimir would flee the battle, defeated.

Duke Austria followed him further east to Krakow and laid siege to the city. The Saxon forces of Otger would break through the city gates, storm it, and captured King Casimir. The bishop of the city oversaw the transfer of the crown to Duke Otger.

Thus, on the 16th of December, 1116, Duke Otger Renart would be crowned King of Poland. During the coronation ceremony, he would meet the beautiful Weslikan of Livonia, to become his third wife.

It would not be long, however, until the peace would be abrupt. The nobles of Poland were not fond of a new Saxon king over their lands. They rebelled against King Otger in November of 1117, trying to place Duke Witosz Piast onto the throne. The irony was that Witosz was not in favor of this, as he became good friends with Otger and supported his kingship.

Two years of rebellion would eventually see the rebels imprisoned by King Otger in December of 1119, who had eventually begun to be led by the former King Casimir again. Casimir and the disloyal vassals had their lands stripped from them and were executed for their rebellion.

Duchess Bo≈ºena of Mazovia began a war of liberation in 1121, during the beginning of the First Crusade. This would only lead to a white peace two years later in 1123, however.

Unfortunately for Otger, his life of drinking would eventually catch up to him. In 1124, as his forces were mustering in preparation for the First Crusade, he died of liver failure in his tent. Otger had failed to have a son with Queen Weslikan, and therefore, the realm and his duchies were split between his four daughters: Imma, Bia, Beatrix, and Wienke.

Imma Renalt would succeed him to the throne in 1124, though her reign would not prove a long one‚Ä¶

# Queen Imma of Poland

[Imma and her ragtag younger sisters got all their dad's lands. Wouldn't fare as they, nor I, expected it.](https://preview.redd.it/r5cxcgn1fa0d1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=bccdab550e554c68f4a37529db93a73e379e5d1d)

**Imma Renart** (August 17, 1090 - August 7, 1124) was Queen of Poland from July 6th of 1124 to August 7th of 1124. She would be queen only for 32 days. Her reign is often forgotten in many histories, as it was overshadowed by her son Oldrik.

Imma Renart was an ambitious and just woman, with much compassion. She was also known for her natural beauty thanks to her mother Gertrude. She inherited much of her father‚Äôs attitude on ruling, and desired to bring peace to Poland when she became queen. With the partitioning of her father‚Äôs many duchies, she received Greater Poland while her sisters gained Lausitz and the Silesian lands.

When she ascended the throne, her younger sister Bia was staging a rebellion to become Queen of Poland herself. Imma at the time was pregnant and was in a period of great stress. According to the Renartnomicron, she was heart-stricken when her spymaster suggested killing her sister. From the stress of the rising rebellion, her pregnancy, her weakened heart (due to her drinking habits), and the spymaster‚Äôs suggestion, she suddenly died from a heart attack on August 7th, 1124. The death was completely unexpected.

Her only son, Oldrik, who was 14 at the time, was off hunting when the news of his mother‚Äôs death came. He was stricken with grief. But little time was left for him, as he would now have to be king‚Ä¶

# King Oldrik 'the Worthy' of Poland and Pomerania

[I didn't expect to play YOU so early!](https://preview.redd.it/jyeogvarga0d1.png?width=411&format=png&auto=webp&s=42cf1bf247a7a91a686237c98982332232add8ff)

**Oldrik Renart** (June 21, 1110 - July 23 1177) became King of Poland on August 7th, 1124 after the sudden death of his mother. An intelligent and handsome man, he is looked back as a good king to the Polish people to this day, and the people of Poland were happy during his rule. He was also known for being a pious king, converting the pagans of Pomerania to the Christian faith. This was commemorated with the building of a great cathedral in Garwolin, which was dedicated in his honor. Another part of his reign was the Conversion of Pomerania, in which he crusaded against the northern pagans.

Oldrick was also known for many of his building projects, particularly within Krakow and Warsaw. Before his rule, Poland was seen as a backwards land to the western Europeans, as it was incredibly undeveloped, its people lived in poverty, and sickness would avail across it. Thanks to Oldrik, many hospices, churches, and castles were built which brought great wealth and prosperity to the realm.¬†

In particular, Oldrik noticed how strategic the lands of Warsaw were. At first it was merely a small village. However, during his reign, he built a mighty castle there and it would soon develop into a strategic city.

On the 7th of August of 1124, Oldrick, then 14 years old, was off hunting when his pregnant mother died of a sudden heart attack, to the shock of everyone in the court. The physicians tried to revive her, but to no avail. The young boy was crowned the King of Poland when he returned to Krakow the same week, though he was frightened of what had just happened. Talks of rebellion stirred within the nobles, particularly his aunt Bia, who was seeking to claim the throne of Poland for herself.

Which is why Oldrik took a strategic gamble and married his aunt Bia, the duchess of Lausitz, in 1126 when he became a man. She would bear a majority of his children, and the marriage was seen as happy, though they were about 6 years apart in age. However, this would prove an important alliance, as the former friend of King Otger, Prince Witosz Piast, would betray the family and sought to take the throne of Poland for himself.

November 8th of that year Prince Witosz staged his rebellion against the young Oldrik Renart. Historians view this as the ‚Äúlast hurrah‚Äù for the House of Piast. Witosz had the support of the remaining Polish nobility while Oldrik was supported by the loyal German counts under his rule in northern Germany.¬†

Witosz was reported to have claimed the former King Otger was a ‚Äútemporary‚Äù monarch set by the Pope, but that it was proper time for the Piasts to take over the throne. King Oldrik disputed this, asserting that it was the will of God, and his divine task, to rule the Polish people. Oldrik took to learning the Polish tongue and dressing himself in traditional Polish noble clothing to assert his place to the people of his realm.

The civil war started by Witosz Piast lasted two years, but he saw his end at the fields outside of Warsaw when he would be captured on the 12th of February, 1128, by Oldrik‚Äôs army. The Treaty of Warsaw had Witosz give up his claims to the throne of Poland. Oldrik traveled to meet the prince a few days later. Oldrik, who had heard Witosz slander the name of his grandfather and murder one of his kinsmen, reportedly spoke only a few words to his grandfather‚Äôs former ‚Äúfriend.‚Äù Witosz would be executed by beheading for his treachery, thus ending the Piast dynasty‚Äôs rule over Poland for good.

When he rode toward the village of Warsaw with his host, he was greeted by the peasantry who declared him ‚Äúworthy of the crown of Poland‚Äù and applauded him. Thus he gained his historical moniker. King Oldrik from then on took interest in the village, and ordered a castle built on the field of which Witosz was defeated.

In the following years, Oldrik would fall in love with his step-grandmother Weslikan, and would find himself having a bastard son named Ulinniks with her in 1131. He hid the existence of this boy for years until he became a court chronicler. He was responsible for the additions of the reign of Oldrik in the Renaltnomicron. He would have another son, Glande, with her, to which he also hid his existence.

He also began to love Queen Bia, his wife, and had many children with her during this time. Bia would also seduce her husband and would often control how he ruled, gaining her the moniker ‚Äúthe Enchantress‚Äù for her beauty and cunning.

In 1137, the duke of Moravia, Wlost Dunin, murdered Oldrik‚Äôs daughter Bia. He would be excommunicated for this act, and then was imprisoned. His titles were taken and he was sent into exile, never to be seen again. King Oldrik would take special care of the town of Warsaw, which he continued to develop. In the same year, Oldrik went to war with Duke Kasper II of Nordmark (a notable pagan prince in Pomerania) to reclaim the duchy of Greater Poland. The war went on until 1140, where Duke Kasper would be defeated, and his lands taken.

Now King Oldrik, though he was not righteous in his acts of adultery, he still believed himself to be a ‚ÄúKing David‚Äù of his day. He believed he was a man after God‚Äôs own heart. He sought to destroy the pagans to his north, who had a great idol in Arkona and worshiped there. This would begin what was known as the Christianization of Pomerania, who allied with the Teutonic Knights who were gifted land in Prussia.

29 November, 1149 was the day that King Oldrik moved against Duke Kasper II of Nordmark once again, this time with the backing of the Teutonic Knights. The war would end on the 5th of May, 1153 with Kasper seeing defeat and dethronement, losing the Duchy of Veletia and being forced to convert, and then was exiled. King Oldrik declared himself King of the Pomeranians, and in an act of change, he traveled to Arkona, to the island of Rana, and ordered the idol to Svetovit torn down.

In the spring of the next year, 1154, Countess Marketa of Pomerania was invaded by the Teutonic knights and King Oldrik, and was forced to convert and submit herself to the rule of King Oldrik.¬†

Not every pagan ruler took kindly to the destruction of the idol at Rana. Count Zbigniew of Pomerania had Queen Bia murdered in October of 1155 as an act of defiance, and declared it was for the glory of Svetovit. He then openly rebelled with the other pagan counts in November, seeking to dethrone Oldrik as King of Pomerania. Once again the Teutonic Knights came to the aid of Oldrik, and together the Polish forces and Teutons were enamored in a religious war for the fate of the pagans.

[King Oldrik riding in battle against the remaining pagan counts.](https://preview.redd.it/yr3fi6q9ha0d1.png?width=851&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33fb1f9fad51f29dcb9c5bfd4cdbaf85ee1ab51)

The war lasted until January of 1158. Zbigniew would be captured for his treachery against the queen in the county of Radom by the Teutonic knights. Zbigniew would be executed for the murder of Queen Bia, and his lands revoked. The Pomeranian lands were granted to Oldrik‚Äôs eldest son, Miesko, who was thought to be in line for being king.

In 1159, King Oldrik joined the crusade against Zaphoriza against the Tengrist pagans. He would lose the Battle of Tor, (which saw him critically injured and nearly die, though he pulled through), though it would ultimately be a victory for the crusaders, and Oldrik‚Äôs son in law, Pawel Renalt, would be made the crusader king over the lands.

The 9th May, 1166, marked the last of the pagans of Pomerania defeated, Count Bedrich, of Santok. The polish armies raided Santok and would capture Count Bedrich, who would be converted to Christianity and forced to submit to the authority of King Oldrik that following August. Legend has it that the Cathedral of Garwolin‚Äôs final stone was laid on the day Count Bedrich converted, leading to the end of Slavic paganism in the Baltics and Poland.

Legends arose about the cathedral, and Oldrik‚Äôs apparent nature in being a holy warrior against the northern pagans. Stories arose about him committing miracles against the pagans. As the chronicler Ulliniks wrote of the legend: ‚ÄúOldrik devoted himself to God and acted entirely in his will. Every Christian wandered the land with the name ‚ÄòOldrik‚Äô on their lips, telling tales of constant holy happenings in his name. Here it is written in Krakow, on the 20th of August in the Year of our Lord 1173.‚Äù

He continued. ‚ÄúThe roads of the faithful were accosted by the godless, and with a blessed blade Oldrik did chase them away. But yet wild beasts and serpents would still wander onto the path and do injury to the faithful, so Oldrik did pull out his trumpet and charm God‚Äôs creations out the lands.‚Äù

‚ÄúKing Oldrik was visited by God who directly spoke to him about the nature of Creation and the beauty of finite life. He emerged from this legendary confrontation a changed man, at peace with the fleeting nature of life and the peace of heaven.‚Äù

In some sense, this was true. Oldrik would seize his adulterous ways after the defeat of the pagans, seeking a pious life. In his elder years, he commissioned the building of a palace in Krakow and continued to develop Warsaw, eventually seeing it become an important, strategic city in the wake of further wars to come. It would also mark the end of the Piasts, and cement the rule of the Renart dynasty as the rulers of Poland.

On the 23rd of July, 1177, King Oldrik would die in his sleep, his old age finally getting to him. In his will, he marked his third eldest son, Wielslaw, to be his heir, instead of his oldest son Miesko. To Miesko instead he was given the Kingdom of Pomerania to rule. Thus the lands would be partitioned.

*Thus far, House Renart has control over the Kingdoms of Poland, Pomerania, and Zaphoriza.*¬†

Curious if local media and the broader sports community neglects FC Cincinnati?

I don't live in the area anymore so only follow through online media and broadcast but it often seems the city isn't fully bought into the team as the most successful pro team in comparison to the Bengals and Reds.

I rarely see local sports publications and online media publish on the team and often as an afterthought. I know we have a great fanbase locally but it doesn't seem like the city actually acknowledges the team in the way that Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and other cities have embraced their MLS teams. 

Curious if others feel the same and what might change the tide for the city?",13 May 2024 18:08:35,reddit
657,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyJournals/comments/1craerp/twilight_arsenal/,Twilight Arsenal,"The machine gun thunders in his grasp as he squeezes the trigger, the hail of leaden death cascading across the lush, emerald grass.

Shell upon shell upon smoldering shell ejects from the side of his weapon as he empties the magazine into the horde of Witness-spawn surging forth.

The spent shells sink into the mud beneath his feet, their metallic sheen disappearing beneath the muck.

Behind the legions of Taken, Grim, and Weavers, a Harbinger stands. It watches them silently, as it has for the past hours of engagement. He can feel it's gaze, almost amused at their resistance.

The Titan crouches behind his meager cover, the feed tray to his weapon flipping open. His fingers are numb as he reloads yet another magazine into the instrument.

He glances up to see his Hunter comrade lean out from her cover and aim her hand cannon.

The thrum of the Weave ripples through the air.

Before he can open his mouth, the Hunter is ripped from her cover by tendrils of thin, jade laces. She yelps as she's drawn into the open, pulled along by the tide of Strand.

It takes mere moments for the Dread to take advantage of her exposure.

The Hunter's corpse drops to the ground, her blood painting the soft turf red.

The Harbinger continues to watch.

The Titan emerges from his cover and raises his arm, pushing his Light outwards. A disc of violet starlight erupts before him as he marches forwards, approaching his teammate's body.

As he covers ground, a Grim rears back, it's mandibles clenching.

The scream rips through his skull like a white-hot blade. He staggers backwards and the shield pops out of existence, the Spark within him smothered and dampened.

The Harbinger watches.

Blood flowing from his ears in rivulets, he scrambles back to his cover. The Warlock extends his palm to the Titan and he feels a warm balm of healing Light wash over him. His hearing returns and he braces his back against the stone.

A glint in the mud catches his attention.

He stares at the spent bullet casing in the silt. For some reason unbeknownst to the Titan, it spurns something within him. A memory that isn't his. A battle long past, a fight etched into the very stone of the Last City. The echo of Fallen Walkers boom in his ears, the crackle of Shock Blades and discharge of wire rifles. The snow of Twilight Gap silencing the screams of Guardians and Fallen alike. A stalemate, a loss.

An opportunity.

An unbreakable defense turned vicious, shattering offense.

*The best defense is a spectacular, bolstering offense!* Lord Shaxx's words vibrate through his bones.

The Titan looks over to his remaining teammate, the Warlock reloading his auto rifle as the miniature star hovering by his shoulder hurls lobs of celestial magma at the enemy.

They don't need an insurmountable defence.

They need a savage, violent offence.

The yawning Void roars within him as he leaps into the air, high above his cover.

The Harbinger watches.

The bolts of concentrated hate pelting their cover focuses on him as his skin becomes enveloped in Void Light.

He rears back, his fingers wrapping around a long shaft sculpted by his Light.

The Titan hurls the first axe, the triangular blade whistling through the air as it hurtles towards a group of Taken.

The Taken are violently pulled towards the axe as it's energy loses stability, rupturing and detonating in a spectacular flash of antimatter.

The Titan hurls a second axe, which hurtles towards a group of Dread. They scramble away from it, clawing at the dirt in futility as they're ripped apart by the axe's compounding mass.

His eyes focus on the Harbinger.

He grips one final axe, raising it above his head.

The Harbinger widens it's stance, no longer passively watching but actively engaged with the new threat.

The Titan throws the axe with such speed and ferocity the Harbinger has no time to dodge.

The blade slams into the Harbinger's smooth forehead, splitting it in two and embedding in it's collarbone. The force of the axe throws the Dread commander's body backwards and tumbling across the grass.

The Warlock peeks over the rock as the Titan lands, his boots sinking into the mud. The Hunter's Ghost manifests over her body and pulses with Light, bathing her body in a restoring aura.

She takes a gasping breath as the Titan approaches the Harbinger's carcass, the axe still embedded in it's clavicle. The Hunter brushes off her body as the Warlock steps into the clearing, the small Solar sprite by his shoulder dissipating in a flash of fire.

The air some distance away becomes thick with orange resonance, obsidian shards gleaming in the sunlight as Husks and a hulking Tormentor appear. It rumbles in it's strange language and the Husks ready their blades.

The Hunter saunters over to one of the axes still planted in the ground and grips it, testing it before yanking it out of the soil. The axe's blade thrums gently with Void Light and she hefts it, trying it's weight.

The Warlock approaches the other, repeating her action. He grunts with effort and he lifts the massive axe, the weapon much too large for his smaller frame.

They take their places next to the Titan as he grips the axe before him by the haft. With a yank, he dislodges it from the Harbinger.

He looks back at his team as the Husks and Tormentor charge, armed with his arsenal, and grins beneath his helmet.

The Titan thrusts his axe in the air once, the weapon making a loud, echoing *clang!*, and rushes forward to meet the enemy, flanked by his allies.",13 May 2024 17:04:11,reddit

Intro: We are reporting live at the site of Bunny‚Äôs Pok√©mon Big Brother Finale House! The crowd is thick and loud as fans from all over are excited to watch the sixteen champions enter the house LIVE! We stand in Poketopia, home of the Battle Revolution! The Shining Neon Colloseum, in a penthouse suite in the grand city is where the final bout will begin!¬† Here come the Legendary Sixteen right now!!!!¬† Lance the original winner is so stunning in his armor! Carlos has evolved and looks much tougher. Nickels is strutting in conifdent as ever next to Xio, who looks completely unphased by all of the winners around her! Selene fits right in with the bright lights. Looks like Candy is evolved as well and‚ÄîOH‚Äîshe tripped over Splaatz. That‚Äôs embarrassing and you can tell she isn‚Äôt happy even if she‚Äôs putting on a smile. Dirk and Echo are next, both eyeing up the competition already. Echo being evolved now already ups his threat level. Mobee gets an uproarious cheer from the crowd! And WOW the Professor gracefully glides over the crowd! He really did escape capture back in Mazda‚Äôs Season. Lisette seems to be meditating and Maeva is pumping herself up. She looks a bit snooty now that we know how she really is but we are eager to see how she plays.¬† Dayley-Jane gets another huge cheer from the crowd. She really is a lovable gal ain‚Äôt she? DJ clicks a track on the DJ booth to keep one last song playing but then hops out to join the entourage. She‚Äôs still keeping up her day job too, so inspiring! Finally, Benedict walks up. Unlike the others, he looks somber. Wonder what his deal is? Oh well, let‚Äôs watch them all compete in the bright stadium for the first HOH!

First HOH: >!¬†In this bright lights HOH, the houseguests all race to complete a task, with the first to complete it knocking someone out of the running. In the first heat, Maeva clears first and knocks out Bane because he came in second and is a huge comp threat. In the next round, Echo wins and takes out Maeva, who just won. Splaatz wins round three by accident and takes out Day, who was big on his original season.¬† Candy wins next and takes out Nickels. Xio takes out DJ, followed by Benedict winning and immediately knocking Xio out. Candy wins again and takes out Dirk. Echo then wins again to take out Candy before she gets too much momentum. Carlos wins and takes out Lance, Mobee then wins and takes out Carlos, Benedict then wins and takes out Mobee!¬† Splaatz wins again and takes out Selene as she is hiding in the background. Lisette wins the next round to take out Benedict. In the final three, Echo wins again and takes out Lisette, as she did a good job hiding til then. In Splaatz versus Echo, the fish surprisingly keeps up with the dragon and at the last second, takes over?!?!?! Splaatz is the first HOH!!<

Week 1: >!Splaatz is very confused how he won that last round but Echo comes up and congratulates him. The two get along well and Splaatz works up the courage to ask to be in an alliance, which the dragon happily agrees. Bane goes to Candy to tell her that the villains need to stick together, she agrees and they grab Maeva. She is initially reluctant, not trusting Bane, but she agrees eventually. Mobee goes to monitor the living room like before and DJ flies up to him. They end up chatting and realize they enjoy each other. At the nomination ceremony, Splaatz has decided to put up DJ and Dirk, saying how he doesn‚Äôt want to make too much waves and this seems to be the way to do it best. Dirk is unamused and DJ is frightened. Echo gets suspicious of Bane and shares his thoughts with Nickels, they pull in Carlos to form an anti-villain alliance.¬† Benedict eavesdrops and plans his next move. He goes up to Nickels and makes up how Dirk must be playing the villain this time, because he is acting weird. Nickels considers his approach but ultimately decides to trust him as an alliance member. At the veto, Carlos, Echo, and Mobee all play but it comes down to Carlos and Splaatz. Splaatz ends up winning again but while actually trying and is exuberant!¬† DJ pleads with him but he ultimately keeps his noms the same.¬†!<

>!After the veto ceremony, Benedict tells DJ to do as he says and trust him, as Gigi did. She agrees and starts buttering up to the villains. She gets Candy to be even nicer to the house and apologize to Splaatz. She also helps Bane create a new game. Meanwhile, Benedict starts prodding Dirk and Day, causing them to be at odds with each other. Dirk eventually snaps and lashes out at Day, shocking everyone.¬† Maeva can tell something fishy is happening but rolls with it since it is week one. At the eviction ceremony in the glittering colosseum, the two nominees tell why they should stay. Dirk is more bitter while DJ stays heartfelt, convincing everyone but a suspicious Maeva. In the end, by a vote of 12 to 1‚Ä¶ Dirk, you have been evicted.!<

Week 2:¬† >!The next HOH is a high flying roulette-themed obstacle course, based off of the Neon Colosseum‚Äôs roulette rules. DJ and Mobee work together to get to the end but Nickels keeps up with them.¬† In the final stretch, Mobee sees Nickels catching up and throws DJ, giving her just enough of an edge to win the HOH!¬† Nickels and Maeva both approach DJ to tell her their suspicions on Benedict‚Äôs behavior.¬† At first, they fight, but realizing they have the same goal causes them to cut it out long enough to tell her. DJ is reluctant but Maeva reminds her how he betrayed Gigi and she is firm.¬† Benedict and Carlos become the nominees. Day, Echo, and Maeva play in the veto and Echo actually manages to come out on top over Day. Echo talks with Nickels about saving Carlos but she is hesitant, telling him that Carlos makes a good pawn next to benedict because everyone likes Carlos.¬† He ends up not using it. During the week, Benedict begins making breakfast early, irritating his roommate Carlos and causing him to be grumpier. Xio confronts Benedict for this, telling him he is purposefully making Carlos mad and it‚Äôs brutal. He tells her he doesn‚Äôt understand the problem if Carlos doesn‚Äôt like breakfast.¬† She sneers but doesn‚Äôt have a comeback. The next day, Benedict holds a house meeting. He apologizes if he‚Äôs been rubbing people the wrong way but he is just trying to fit in since he is newer. Lisette says that everyone should give him a chance, which the villains, Selene, and Mobee agree with. Echo, Carlos, Nickels, and Maeva are all hesitant.¬† At the eviction ceremony, Carlos is grumpy and bitter and doesn‚Äôt do much to defend himself.¬† Benedict, again apologizes. In a 9 to 3 vote‚Ä¶ Carlos is evicted.!<

Week 3:¬† >!Several house membets are completely shocked by Carlos going home, including HOH DJ and his two allies, Nickels and Echo. Also surprised is Xio.¬† The next HOH is an endurance comp called the floor is lava based off of the Lava Colosseum! Mobee, Splaatz, and Xio are the last three remaining. Knowing she was on the outs of the last vote, Xio fights hard to survive, fighting her pain. Splaatz eventually drops and Mobee remains with Xio. Eventually, Mobee drops and Xio wins!¬†¬† Xio already knows her noms. She puts up Benedict next to Selene, as she was one of the people vouching for him last round.¬† Benedict chooses to stay back and not make too much of a scene this round, lest he blow up his cover. Meanwhile, DJ and Mobee plan how to move forward. Maeva is listening in to this convo and realizes how close they are.¬† At the veto, a mental comp, Selene ends up winning by a landslide, saving herself.¬† Maeva rushes to Xio about the DJ and Mobee situation, and points out how Mobee is a comp threat as well. Xio decides Mobee is a good replacement, as he is likeable and a good pawn next to Benedict.¬† Mobee holds a house meeting and cries during it, thinking he was doing so much better at being friendly this time.¬† Maeva calls him out for his crocodile tears and argues that he is putting on an act. Lisette calls out Maeva for being so harsh and chastises her for being such a villain. Maeva asks her if she is planning on voting for him to stay and she is silent, but says that shouldn‚Äôt matter. Maeva retorts and says it‚Äôs not jury so jury management doesn‚Äôt exist yet. At the eviction, Mobee is shaking next to a smug Benedict. Benedict‚Äôs speech touches on how Mobee doesn‚Äôt seem ready for the big leagues. The bear gets up angrily and almost picks up Benedict, shocking everyone. He stops himself and realizes what he did.¬† The vote comes in and by a vote of 8 to 3, Mobee, you have been evicted.!<

Week 4: >!The next HOH begins as they houseguests must ascend a glimmering rock wall, themed after the Crystal colosseum.¬† Day and Maeva take an early lead but are caught up by falling rocks. Lisette closes the gap and eventually surpasses Maeva. Day and Lisette race for the end and‚Ä¶ Lisette win!¬† Lisette in her HOH room ponders about who to put up and ally with. She turns to Xio, Day, and Selene as her allies. The Witch‚Äôs Coven, as they call themselves, wants to shift the focus, as Benedict is doing too well at not going home. Instead, Lisette targets Maeva, who is playing sneaky, as well as Benedict‚Äôs ally, Echo.¬† Bane laughs at Maeva being on the block and she is enraged with him. He says ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt matter since it‚Äôs not jury yet.‚Äù Having her own words turned on her, Maeva storms out and swears she will get revenge on him and Candy.¬† At the POV, the witches‚Äô coven is playing with three members and Xio ends up winning!¬† She chooses to keep the nominations the same.¬† Splaatz goes to Lance to tell him how much it means to be there with one of his heros, but Lance mishears him and calls him out for calling him a rude name. The two get in a petty argument where Lance‚Äôs bad hearing keeps making things worse. Meanwhile, Maeva tries to get the vote off of her by spreading anti-Benedict propaganda around the house. Day has a change of heart about this and wants to vote out Echo, even while her alliance is targeting Maeva. Benedict, aware his name is still out there, pleads to DJ not to vote out his ally. At the eviction, Maeva thinks she has done enough work but the vote comes out and is a 5 to 5. The Coven is shocked, one of their own must have flipped. But Lisette gets to break the tie, and is all too happy to evict her target, Maeva.!<

Week 5: >!The next HOH is themed after the Sunset colosseum, and sees the houseguests racing to stack piles of rubble. Echo, DJ, and Xio make the highest stack but DJ‚Äôs crumbles before the time limit. Both wanting to take control, Echo and Xio try really hard to build the highest. The timer buzzes aaaand Echo is the winner!¬† Benedict instinctively high fives Echo and celebrates with him. Later, Nickels is peeved that Echo is so publicly working with Benedict. Echo tells her she had the opportunity to have a good ally but she chose to burn that bridge and that‚Äôs her fault. Offended, she tells him to make that alliance with Benedict work out but she won‚Äôt be part of it.¬† Echo is saddened, but doesn‚Äôt want to put Nickels up. Instead, he shifts the target to former villains, with Bane being the target and Selene going up next to him.¬† Xio cheers that Selene could be going home, making the Lamp angry at her, since they were supposed to be working together. Benedict goes on to win the veto and vows to Echo not to use it. However, at the veto ceremony, he uses it to save Selene, shocking everyone as he winks at Xio. Echo then solidifies this by putting Xio up.¬† Selene goes to her to tell her she is sorry for their misunderstanding but they work together. Candy turns to Lisette and tells her she is tired of working with Bane and if she helps her get the Professor out this week, she will work with her. Lisette agrees, knowing everyone wants Bane out anyways. At the eviction, Xio seemingly patches things up with everyone. The vote comes in, by a unanimous vote‚Ä¶ Bane, you are evicted.!<

>!Double Eviction: Surprise! The Jury starts tonight and the next HOH is beginning right now with one more person leaving!¬† A quiz colosseum is held in the Sunset colloseum, with one miss causing someone to be out of the running. It comes down to DJ, Nickels, and Lisette. But Lisette gets the last question right and the other two miss, with Lisette winning her second HOH.¬† Lisette puts up Nickels and Day. Nickels because she is playing a lowkey game but making waves in the Benedict situation. Day because she wavered on her vote for Benedict.¬† She doesn‚Äôt put down Benedict as he is good for drama and polarizing the house, which is good for her game.¬† Nickels wins the veto and takes herself off.¬† Lisette decides to put up Splaatz, because she is worried he will fumble his way to the end.¬† Most people seem to share this idea except for Echo, who wants to wotk with Splaatz. The vote comes in. By a vote of 7 to 1‚Ä¶ Splaatz, you have been evicted and will be moving into the jury house.!<

>!Week 6: The Next HOH begins as a race through the mysterious mansion in the courtyard colosseum. No one can tell where anyone is but Candy comes out first and wins! As HOH, Candy calls in Benedict. She tells him he has been playing a sloppy and obvious villain game and he is gonna get evicted too soon if he doesn‚Äôt simmer down and get some real allies. He is shocked and admits he just wants to win. She says they all do and the least they can do is help each other. She says she will help him if he keeps causing more chaos and also gets DJ on their side. He agrees and talks to DJ. The squirrel is hesitant but decides it would be a great way of getting revenge on Benedict if she gets the chance.¬† Candy puts up Lance as the pawn next to her target, Xio, who has been against Benedict‚Äôs chaos this whole game.¬†¬† DJ goes on to win the veto and chooses to not give Candy any suspicion by not using it. Meanwhile, the witches coven fractures, with Day not agreeing with Lisette and Xio feeling not supported on the block by Selene. DJ infiltrates this meeting after storms out, telling them about Xio being the real target but she has a plan to keep her without drawing suspicion if they can get Day to play nice. Xio borrows an item from Lisette and breaks it. Lisette then goes to ‚Äúrant‚Äù to Day, who is being nice with her, thinking they both will vote Xio. Echo, meanwhile, confirms his alliance with Benedict, and feels like he is finally gaining more traction. But the house takes this the wrong way. At the eviction, the vote comes in, and by a vote of 4 to 3‚Ä¶ Lance, you have been evicted.!<

Week 7: >!The next HOH begins, a waterfall diving competition, based off of the Waterfall Colosseum. Whoever makes the biggest splash wins!¬† With her natural watery prowess, Day dives in and wins the HOH!¬† Day is approached in the HOH by Candy and Benedict, who ask her to work with them. DJ sees whats happening and goes back to Lisette and Selene. The two talk and realize that they can‚Äôt beat Benedict‚Äôs control of the house by just going against him, but they have to work with him.¬†¬† So the three of DJ, Lisette, and Selene enter the HOH ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù and propose the six will control the house. They say they want Echo to go on the block, as he is getting too good at the comps. Benedict is hesitant but Candy nudges him, as secretly this will be great for her game. He agrees and tells Day he won‚Äôt be mad if this happens.¬† Echo goes up next to Nickels. The two former allies face off in the veto, both bitterly making jabs at the other for turning on them. It comes down to just the two nominees and‚Ä¶ Echo edges her out, winning the veto.¬† Echo saves himself and puts the power in Day‚Äôs hands to put up a replacement. Her choice is the person not in her alliance who has made affronts to her, Xio. Lisette has the whole house do tarot readings to ease the tension which goes down well. Lisette gets the Sun, a symbol of positivity and creativity. Benedict draws the Moon, symbolizing Illusion and inner conflict. He shudders when the white moon of the card turns red in his hands. Echo draws the Fool, a card of new beginnings but also endings. Selene draws death, the card of change in the game. Nickels draws the Hermit, a card of isolation and reflection. Candy draws the Lovers, with the card representing connections and pairs, symbolizing her manipulation of Benedict.¬† Day draws Strength, a card of inner strength and Willpower. Xio draws the Tower, representing sudden downfall and incredible sudden changes. She shudders and uses the moment to apologize to everyone, saying she wants to be a beacon of hope but got lost. The house receives this well.¬† Benedict considers flipping to Xio because of her show of faith being bad but Candy reminds him that Xio is on the bottom of the pecking order on that side, likely meaning they don‚Äôt even have to take her out. He relents and the eviction goes through. The vote comes in and by a vote of 5 to 1, Nickels you have been evicted.!<

Week 8: >!The Next HOH begins in the Sunny Park colosseum, with contestants having to hunt for pellets and use them to knock out targets. DJ and Echo prove the most adept but in a last second victory, Echo wins.¬† Benedict goes to Echo in the HOH but Echo has realized too late that Benedict is working with everybody, even causing him to turn on Nickels. Benedict doesn‚Äôt try to hide his smug smirk as he agrees and walks out, daring him to put him on the block.¬† He feels this must be hiding something and starts asking around the house for their opinions. Xio reveals the existence of the Witches Coven, and how they have been together for weeks, including saving her last week. Knowing of this alliance, Echo saves Xio and puts up Selene and Day. At the veto, Selene wins.¬† Selene approaches Echo, telling him she knows of someone playing both sides, revealing DJ trying to play double agent. After she pulls herself off the block, DJ goes up as the replacement. Candy works on ingratiating herself with the outsiders in Xio and Echo, trying to forge paths ahead. But is unsuccessful at breaking Echo. Echo is accosted by DJ for putting her up over Benedict. He asks her to say why she was double crossing and she says its because she was trying to sabotage Benedict. If anything, Day, Selene, and Lisette should be the real double agents. Echo goes to rage to Selene for how she tricked him but she swears it was the truth completely, and he chose to believe it in a negative light, not her.¬† Day joins the fight and lashes out at Xio and Selene for being the reason she is on the block. Lisette stays out of it, knowing the time to jump ship is coming up. At the eviction, Dj and DayJay give their pleas, but the votes are tallied. By a unanimous vote‚Ä¶ Dayley-Jane, you have been evicted.!<

>!Double Eviction!!: Second double eviction because you know we gotta! The HOH starts with a lightning round of dodgeball on wooden poles. Selene is knocked out first. Then DJ gets knocked out by Candy. Lisette falls off on her own. Xio goes after Benedict but is taken out by Candy. Then Candy expertly dodges and takes out Benedict, winning the HOH. ¬†¬†She nominates the two people who are on the bottom of the pecking order, Echo and Xio. The veto plays out with Benedict winning. Echo pleads for Benedict to help him out, as they were friends. Benedict doesn‚Äôt even look him in the eye as he chooses to not play the veto.¬† Echo pleads to the voters to let him keep playing and he will take out Benedict, but Lisette and Selene have basically already jumped ship and moved on. The vote comes in, and by a vote of 4 to 0‚Ä¶ Echo, you have been evicted.!<

Week 9: >!With Six houseguests remaining, they are taken to the Gateway colosseum to have mock Pokemon battles. In the first round, Xio beats Lisette and Selene beats DJ, with Benedict drawing a spot in the top 3. In a first to win two times in a row scenario, Selene beats both and comes out victorious.¬† Selene and Lisette decide that they have to cut ties and work with the more devious players to have a better shot at the end. Selene puts up DJ and Xio, with DJ being the target.¬†¬† Benedict is alone in his room when he hallucinates more blood on his paws. He shouts and Xio comes in to see whats up. She helps him calm down and he realizes he is down a bad path.¬† She helps him calm down and he thanks her, even with him harassing her all game she still helped him. Candy witnesses the two help each other out and is beyond irritated, she goes to Selene, who is still iffy on Xio, to warn her.¬† At the veto, Candy wins it. She takes off DJ and Selene spitefully puts up Benedict, who trembles going to the block. Lisette confronts Selene for making such a rushed decision, as the goal was to keep Benedict and his threat around longer. At the eviction, Benedict argues that he has realizes how the game has changed him and he wants to prove how he changed. Lisette doesn‚Äôt believe him but DJ seems to be enamored.¬† The vote comes in, and by a vote of 2 to 1‚Ä¶ Xio you have been evicted.!<

Week 10: >!Five stars remain and there are five points in the Stars of the Main Street colosseum, where the houseguests go to do a full BPBB quiz! Lisette misses one question and gets behind as the other get ahead. It comes down to a tie-breaker between Dj and Benedict and the winner is‚Ä¶ DJ!¬† Benedict goes to apologize to DJ for real and she forgives him, happy to see his true self back again. She feels played by Selene and Candy so they go on the block.¬†¬† Lisette is still suspicious of Benedict and starts watching him for suspicious activity, noticing him look at his paws a lot. She decides to talk to him with the ruse of working together. At the veto, DJ wins again and claims her game, choosing not to use the veto. Realizing the danger they are in, Selene and Candy go to their respective closest allies, Benedict and Lisette.¬†¬† The two touch base with Benedict telling Lisette he is fine voting Candy with her, as he doesn‚Äôt want to force DJ to have to break a tie. At the eviction, the votes are read and by a vote of 2 to 0‚Ä¶ Selene, you have been evicted. Benedict looks over at Lisette with a shocked look, realizing she caught on to him.¬†!<

Week 10:¬† >!As the final HOH starts, the houseguest are in the Stargazer colosseum for an epic triathlon of quizzes, endurance, and races.¬† In the first part, Benedict pulls ahead, with Lisette on his tail. He falls behind in part two, giving Lisette and Candy a chance to catch him. The three are neck and neck in part three but Lisette comes out on top!¬† Benedict goes to Lisette on her HOH to grovel but she stops him, saying she misheard the vote last week and though the vote was for Selene anyways so its good he didn‚Äôt make poor DJ break the tie. He feels reassured and goes back out. Lisette puts up DJ and Candy as the nominees.¬† Lisette reassures DJ about how Benedict likes her and she wouldn‚Äôt go home. Benedict touches base with Lisette, claiming that he knows DJ has too much social traction and needs to go next because of this. On his way out, Candy enters the room and chats with Lisette. She says that the noms should stay the same so DJ can be evicted for sure this week. Lisette doesn‚Äôt trust her and tells her to her face she is no better than Benedict, but is powerless without him. ¬†The two stare each other down. At the veto, Lisette wins it, and Benedict sighs a sigh of relief. But Lisette shocks everyone by saving Candy and puts up Benedict. Lisette calls him out for faking his turnaround to play with everyone‚Äôs emotions. He breaks down, claiming his intense want, no, NEED to win the game. He can‚Äôt get it out of his head and it burdens him with the thoughts of betrayal, including the allies he betrayed this season, with Nickels, Echo, and even Xio who showed him so much kindness leaving because of him. DJ is in tears and even Candy can‚Äôt watch.¬† Afterwards, Benedict goes to his only real ally, Candy. He begs her for advice on how to get out of this, as she helped him so much. She looks him in the eye as she tells him that he did this to himself. At the eviction, Candy gets the sole vote to evict and casts it to evict, Benedict.!<

The Reunion: >!Folks we are live again right outside the Neon Colosseum for the Finale of Bunny‚Äôs Pok√©mon Big Brother Champion Royale! ¬†Our Sixteen winners have been whittled down to three and it is not what we expected at all! In a house where everyone wants to be the biggest truck on the highway, we have three mid-sized sedans who have slipped through the gaps and swept their way to the end. DJ VOLT SWITCH, Elesa‚Äôs iconic Emolga who created the jams we are listening to even right now! She plays up her social game very well with honesty and loyalty, but is no slouch in the competitions. Though she has been left out of some secrets in the game, she was well=liked in the house and leveraged her position between alliances to get information! Sweet Candy the Wigglytuff who played Sickly Sweet last but downright Sick this time. She got in close with all of the villains but managed to be the cherry flavored licorice that was easier to manage. She avoided detection aligning with big villain Benedict and hiding behind the scenes of his chaos, even almost controlling his moves at points. The Sunstone herself, LISETTE the Solrock, who foresaw victory once, but is this a double reading? Lisette bided her time throughout the game, getting whatever information she could and waiting to play it until the time was right. She was at the center of multiple alliances but always stayed just far enough away from the drama that no one was even targeting her. The Sun? No Lisette is after The World!!<

>!Joining us on stage now are the 9 jurors! Starting with Splaatz‚ÄîOpe watch your step, you gotta be careful or else you‚Äôll trip. Here comes Lance the OG! Though he is old he is still our knight in shining armor. Nickels struts up so casually ooh lala. Here comes Echo, kind of sheepishly, don‚Äôt be shy buddy! Day gracefully swims up on stage, still to audience cheering. Wait, the cheering is getting louder? Oh it‚Äôs Xio! She is surprisingly well-received. Selene keeps the applause growing. She seems to be goading the audience on with her behavior, not wanting to stay out of the spotlight hmm. And then‚Äîoh wow I can‚Äôt hear anything with the thunder of the crowd for‚Ä¶ Benedict? Interesting outcome here that our little villain has become a real crowd pleaser. Even as he walks to his seat with his head held low.¬†!<

>!The jurors speak with our lovely reporter.¬† Lance speaks about how great it was to come back and how this game is way changed from when he won season 1. Xio and Nickels agree, but they still worked hard to adapt to the changes. Selene scoffs a bit, another early winner, she notes that herself and Candy were very well integrated, they just needed to change their approach. Xio says it was much harder playing from the bottom rather than the top and it was a fight, but she had a ton of fun doing so. Day mentions she felt the same way. A house full of winners is not to be underestimated for a second, as they all could be planning many different things behind each other‚Äôs backs. Splaatz is‚Äîoh he‚Äôs asleep‚Ä¶ moving on. Nickels asks Echo about how he changed his game this time, and why he turned on her. He apologizes, saying he was blinded by seeing opportunities with Benedict because he didn‚Äôt fight with him, only told him what he wanted to hear. And he realized too late that that was a ruse. She accepts his apologies and all eyes turn to Benedict. He looks up, seemingly just noticing eyes are on him. He looks down at his paws. ‚ÄúAll I‚Äôve seen since last season is blood on my paws. The need to win never left me. I had to do it at all cost. I lost myself in that game and resorted to every trick in the book to make the winners trust me. And it worked‚Ä¶ but I fell deeper and deeper down the hole. And now, I don‚Äôt feel like I deserved to win at all.‚Äù¬† Xio jumps up and makes him look up. ‚ÄúYou deserved your win as much as we all deserved ours. It‚Äôs a game, it doesn‚Äôt have to define you.¬† You define you, so get up and prove it.‚Äù Benedict is in disbelief that Xio is still defending him. ‚ÄúYou hear that crowd? They were entertained, we entertained them! Your devioushness entertained them! You gave them a show by tricking¬† a bunch of winners, so own up to it and be the entertainer we know you are.‚Äù He gives off a small, barely noticeable,but definitely real this time, smile. Xio turns to the crowd ‚ÄúARE YOU GUYS READY FOR OUR FINAL THREE???‚Äù The crowd erupts in excitement!! ‚ÄúTHEN GET READY BECAUSE HERE THEY ARE!!‚Äù!<

Final HOH Part 1: >!The HOH opens on top of the rotating Roulette wheel in the Neon Colosseum, with the audience now filled and the three houseguests circling in the middle, holding on for dear life. At the same time, they are throwing dodgeballs at each other. Candy is targeting Lisette out of spite, putting on a performance for the audience about how Lisette is a traitor to their alliance. ¬†DJ is caught in the crossfire but expertly dodges. She manages to catch a ball that Candy threw and chucks it back, knocking her out. Lisette smiles at DJ but DJ knows she still has to win. She tells Lisette she is sorry but she is done working with people and has to take her game into her own hands, not relying on others to fail but herself to succeed. Lisette agrees, but she wants to be the one to succeed. Lisette lobs a ball at Dj and knocks her out, winning Part 1.!<

Final HOH Part 2: >!Part begins with Candy and DJ on the Rotating Roulette platform again, racing around to land the colored balls in order of the competitions and the winners of each one. DJ takes an early lead, having been very aware of the game the whole beginning. Candy struggles at first but when she catches up to leaving the villains alliance and joining Benedict, she takes off, knowing how well she played Benedict as her own puppet that she controlled votes for that she easily crushes the midgame part. Her lead takes her ahead on time going into the endgame. DJ misses a key vote and has to go back, but Candy remembers who saved Benedict countless times, and gets it right, winning part 2.!<

Final HOH Part 3: >!The crowd is in uproars as Candy and Lisette reach the stage for final quiz, again on our roulette platform (we paid a lot of money for that).¬† Each juror question goes by, with Lisette and Candy answering in tandem, Both get question after question correct, eventually reaching the last question about Benedict. The crowd is shocked as they both answer together again and‚Ä¶ get it wrong. Well, that‚Äôs anticlimactic. Benedict sighs, no one knew his true self. But the tie-breaker is revealed, how many rotations has the rotating platform made? With both answering two numbers away from each other, Candy goes just over, eliminating her, and crowning Lisette the final HOH. Lisette has both DJ and Candy in front of her. She doesn‚Äôt say much but looks at them. She says that DJ played an impeccable social game and is incredibly loved by the fans and the house. Candy, meanwhile, played a strategic game and almost fooled her a couple times.¬† She turns to Candy ‚ÄúI made a gamble with bringing a social threat to the end before with Amni, but not this time. Candy, let‚Äôs give em a show.‚Äù And casts her vote to evict DJ.!<

The Jury Questioning:¬† >!DJ isn‚Äôt shocked, she did a lot this time around and knew she made herself a bigger threat. She exits the house and gets cheers from the audience! She hops to the DJ booth and begins playing the final epic track for the showdown between Candy and Lisette. Both have been in this position before in the final 2 and both have won, but now, only one can become a two-time winner and be crowned the ultimate Champion! Lisette opens with her speech first. She pitches her game strong, how she gravitated towards groups in the early game without committing too strongly, so she didn‚Äôt go down with the ship. ¬†She still managed to control so many votes in the house by having reach with her Witches Coven and eventually jumping ship and siding with Benedict, as she knew he was under Candy‚Äôs thumb and she could infiltrate that alliance to get to the end and destroy it. The jury is impressed by her showing and all eyes turn to Candy. Candy starts saying how she knew her game was already known going into the house and she had to play different. Her main strategy was to fall into the background and connect with the players playing sloppier than her so she could be the puppetmaster and sneak to the end. And for her, that was found in Benedict, who she found it very easy to manipulate. She is the villain they all knew she was but she wasn‚Äôt targeted because of her great strategy. She saved Benedict‚Äôs game and carried him to the end so that she could have a guaranteed extra life in the endgame with him.¬† Murmurs arise from the jury, Benedict looks incredibly hurt.  Xio asks Candy what her biggest move was outside of controlling Benedict. Candy says that she made sure that the villains she worked with got cut before she could get too powerful, even working with Lisette to get out Bane and Maeva. ¬†DJ gets up from the booth and asks Lisette why she went to the end with Candy instead of her if she thought Candy was going to be tougher. Lisette clarifies that she thought Candy would be good at explaining her game, but she knows not to rely on other‚Äôs failing but on herself to succeed, and DJ has a great story and was well-loved and if she wanted to win, she had to cut DJ and masterfully explain her game to the jury. Benedict finally speaks up to ask Candy if he meant anything to her at all throughout the game. She hesitates, caught off guard, before replying in all honesty that, she wanted to mentor him to be a better player. He says he did well enough for making it to the end twice and didn‚Äôt need her to do all that. In their final speeches, Candy says that she used other people as her pawns and navigated a really good game to make it to the end hidden amongst the other players. Lisette says that she played a perfect game, not even touching the block and noting that she has not received a vote against her in either of her games, this one being perfect. She finishes by saying how she played more up front and aggressive to counter the sneakier players of the season and did not back down from the threats that all the winners possessed.¬† The jury is impressed and goes to cast their votes.!<

Jury Voting: >!Splaatz says he had a fun time playing again and wants to vote for someone who played really good, even showing him more how to play. Lance says that while some people are old school, some people are REALLY old school, but can still play with the best of the best and be even better. Nickels says she is honored to be in the winners season but one winner played like how she thinks a winner should. Day says she worked with both finalists, but she always felt the house pulling towards one player, as the sun has a lot of gravity and control over the tides. Echo says point blank that he felt the manipulation from both sides, but one felt malicious, and another felt like game, and he knows which he respects more. Xio says that some lines shouldn‚Äôt be crossed. Selene says that she was honored to be so thoroughly outplayed, turning from the Queen to the Pawn who was merely a stepping stone in someone elses game, it was thrilling. Benedict silently casts his vote. DJ cues the final tune before hopping down with her vote, saying that it should be obvious. The votes come in‚Ä¶ by a vote of 9 to 0‚Ä¶ the winner is‚Ä¶!<

Winner: >!Lisette!!<

Runner-Up: >!Candy!!<

>!Confetti cannons and flamethrowers start lighting up the sky with neon streams shining bright all over the sky! Though it is the dead of night, it is as bright as the sun, and Lisette is feeling absolutely radiant. Candy sits in shock, in disbelief. Lisette throws her the Lovers card again. ‚ÄúYou misread it the first time so maybe you can learn before you try to tell the fortune teller what her fortune is.‚Äù Candy throws the card on the ground in anger and pouts. The jurors go and cheer for Lisette, the ultimate champion and two time winner, STILL having never received a single vote to evict in two entire seasons. The fan favorite vote comes in and‚Ä¶ IT‚ÄôS A TIE???!<

Fan Favorites: >!Benedict and Xio!!!!<

>!Benedict goes up to Candy, still fuming, and looks her in the eyes. ‚ÄúYou know what, you really did teach me something. You taught me that some people never change, but I don‚Äôt have to be one of them.‚Äù Xio comes up and takes Benedict back to the celebration, sticking her tongue out at Candy as she leaves. The party goes through the night. The sun eventually rises, as Lisette has risen to the top of the competition, as this era of Bunny‚Äôs Pokemon Big Brother has come to an end.¬†!<

My Thoughts: >!I enjoyed this season a lot. It kept me on the edge as the winners played their games again, some way better than others. ¬†Gameplay-wise, I think I preferred last season but I think it‚Äôs more so because of the subtle moves made in the dark as no one wanted to be too big of a target. ¬†¬†The villains ended up flopping early, which kind of was to be expected, given that everyone else is a relaly smart player to have won. ¬†Candy surprised me this time, sneaking in to take over Benedict, being a key player in his storyline, even a bigger villain than he tried to be. It really helped me tie up the storyline really well and I like how it happened. She also played a stellar game again, controlling things from the chaos in the shadows. The other side of the house was not slouching though. Lisette, Selene, Xio, and Day all played smart games, not committing too much to each other but still working well enough to not crumble.¬† Lisette as a winner for this season is great! She put in work to keep her position, as it was in danger of falling apart so much. She leveraged every ally she had and every competition she had to get forward every week. ¬†And it worked as she got to the end without hitting the block AGAIN and played a PERFECT game, not receiving a single vote to evict and getting every vote to win. She did that in a winner season too, ultimate winner for sure!¬† !<

So whats next? Well... that's the end. I knew since the beginning that Season 17 would be the end but it coming up still feels so weird. I am about to start a busy summer and don't have as much time for all of my hobbies but I still feel sad finishing this series. I think I am going to make a series epilogue soon so stay tuned for that but... otherwise that's it. I thank you all again so much for sticking with me the whole time, it's been a wonderful journey!",13 May 2024 16:15:11,reddit

662,https://www.reddit.com/r/relativeobscurity/comments/1cr592e/i_found_a_set_of_blank_cassette_tapes_at_the_junk/,I found a set of blank cassette tapes at the junk store. And someone died trying to find what they led to.,"Link to original r/nosleep post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bml3v0/i\_found\_a\_set\_of\_blank\_cassette\_tapes\_at\_the\_junk/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1bml3v0/i_found_a_set_of_blank_cassette_tapes_at_the_junk/)

The¬†[journey](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/vOIUjP81SQ)¬†to discovering the first body was even more exhausting than I anticipated. And according to the tapes that I'd found in the junk store, there were still seven more out there... somewhere in the marsh.

*Who knows how far we'll have to go, just to find the next one?*¬†I wondered, as I waited for the second cassette's audio to begin playing.

""If you're listening to this, you found the first body in the marsh. To find the second, simply take five steps north."" The narrator began, his voice playing back from the cassette player and into my headphones.

But upon waiting for further instructions, I only heard silence.

*Wait... What?*¬†I thought to myself, before the man continued.

""You're probably wondering how that could be possible. Well, the truth is, the body that you just found... is part of a pair. A couple, to be precise. In this case, a very old couple, guilty of buying into a false dream. That, of lifelong companionship. An illusion of eternal love, knowing full well, that we're all born alone... and die alone. When you're ready to find the next body, switch over to the third tape.""

CLICK.

I pressed pause on the cassette player.¬†*There are two bodies here?*

That's when I remembered that Jess and Mike were still digging in the mud, a few feet from where we found the first body, in an attempt to find its clue, and completely unaware that there was another corpse beneath their feet.

""Wait! Stop!"" I called out to them.

But it was too late.

Seeing the remains of the second body, Jess screamed and stumbled back, while Mike, having just pulled a small wooden box out of the ground, suddenly dropped it and closed his eyes.

""Another one?"" He yelled out to me.

""Yeah. According to the tapes, it was a couple."" I explained.

""Well thanks for warning us!"" Jess added.

""I just played it now!""I replied.

""Well did it say their names?"" Mike asked.

""Their names? No. But it said they were very old.""

""Ah, okay.""

""Why do you ask?""

""No reason."" Mike replied, defensively.

""So what was the clue?"" Jess interjected.

Mike picked up the wooden box that he had just unearthed from the burial site, opened it, and revealed a piece of paper, with nothing but the letter ""J"" written on it.

""What do you think it means?"" I asked.

""It's just one clue, idiot."" Mike scoffed. ""It's too soon to say. More the reason we get to finding the others. What are the next instructions?""

I switched tape ""2"" for tape ""3"" and pressed play.

CLICK.

""You've made it to tape three. Which means you've discovered the first two bodies. To find the next one, keep heading in the same direction you've been walking, and don't stop until you find the wreckage of an old boat, lodged in the mud. Not far from it, you'll find the third body. When you do, switch to tape four.""

CLICK.

‚Äî

We'd been trudging through the marsh, navigating the fog with just a single flashlight, for what must have been another twenty minutes or so, when Jess and Mike's banter began to wear on me.

""You know, with the election coming up in just a few days, I really wish I could vote."" Jess said to Mike.

""Why?"" He asked.

""'Cause then I could help change the world.""

""That's not how it works. You'd vote for Clinton in an already blue state, so it would basically mean nothing.""

""You're both wrong!"" I interrupted. ""The world doesn't change overnight, and her vote would matter. But none of us are old enough to vote anyway, so can we just drop-""

But before I could continue, Jess interjected, calling back to Mike and I from up ahead.

""Hey guys...""

We both looked over, to find her pointing to, of all things, a thick mist that was enveloping everything ahead of us, and rapidly closing in.

""Maybe we should head back after all."" Jess backtracked.

""Yeah, you already found a second body, Mike. Now can we just go home?"" I insisted.

But Mike wasn't having it.

""Sorry losers. We gotta keep going. A vote's a vote. But we're almost there. And don't worry, a little fog's not gonna hurt nobody.""

That's when it hit me.

""Mike, back at the last couple we found. You had asked me if the tape had said their names?""

""Yeah. So what?"" He replied.

""Why is that?""

""I told you. No reason.""

""Just be honest.""

""Alright fine..."" He said, before pausing for a moment, and then looking me in the eyes. ""...I thought that maybe my dad was one of them.""

""I knew it!"" I exclaimed, frantically pacing around the grass. ""Mike, are you kidding me? That's why you're dragging us along with you?""

""Now that I know there are all these missing people out here, it just got me thinking... Maybe that's where he ended up."" He replied.

""Dude,"" I began, ""Hate to break it ya, but your dad was a drunk, who went to the packie one day, and never came back. I don't know where he is. But one thing I do know is... he sure as heck ain't out here.""

""What did you just say, Tyler?"" Mike growled, his face growing red with anger, as he stormed over to me.

But Jess jumped between us. ""Hey, stop!""

""Fine. You know what. I don't need you guys. I'll find the rest of the bodies myself."" Mike said defiantly, as he turned around and walked away.

""But what about the mist? We only have one flashlight."" I yelled out to him.

""Keep it! I don't need it!"" He called back to us, without looking back, as he disappeared into the fog.

‚Äî

Jess and I must have been walking in circles for a good thirty minutes, disoriented by the mist, before we finally got our bearings, and continued on our way back home.

""It's just funny is all. Pahk the cah."" Jess said, doing her best impression of a Boston accent, while careful not to trip in the grass.

""That's your impression of me?"" I asked, my boots splashing in the mud.

""Yeah, is it wicked pissah, kid?"" She answered playfully.

""Good one."" I replied. ""Easy for you transplants to joke about our accents, after you move to our town, with your fancy homes, your fancy cars, and your Long Island accents. Well, you know what? Maybe I find your accent funny too.""

""Do you now?""

I paused for a moment.

""Nah, it's cute."" I replied.

""Cute?"" Jess asked.

""Oh, I mean uh... totally not cute at all, I swear.""

She stopped and gave me a cheeky smile.

""Tyler, are you flirting with me?""

""No..."" I said, as she took a step closer.

""'Cause you know, out here in the marsh, surrounded by a sinister fog and all these dead corpses, might be...""

""An inappropriate time?"" I interjected, my face beginning to blush.

Jess leaned in even closer, her face just an inch from mine, and smiled. ""...Romantic.""

As she was about to kiss me, I saw her close her eyes, but couldn't seem to close mine, completely in shock that this moment was finally happening.

But just before her lips touched mine, I felt my boots sinking into the mud, and tilted my head down, leaving her hanging there, confused.

""What's wrong?"" Jess asked, opening her eyes, a look of disappointment washing over her face.

""Um... We have a bit of a problem."" I said, gesturing to the ground, where both of our legs were now almost completely submerged in the mud.

""Oh no!"" Jess said, before attempting to pull herself out of the ground, and realizing that she was stuck. I followed suit, also to no avail.

Then we looked at each other, and both began to laugh at the awkward situation we'd gotten ourselves into... until we continued to sink deeper and deeper into the mud.

Jess' eyes suddenly turned from jovial to concerned, and she began yelling, ""Help! Help!""

I joined in, but after a few minutes of shouting, began to lose hope, accepting our inevitable demise, and the irony of two more bodies being added to the marshy graveyard.

But just when the mud reached our necks, as we each shot each other one last look of affection, suddenly someone came stomping over, and ripped us out of the ground.

""What on earth are you two kids doing out here at this hour?"" Our rescuer exclaimed, as he dropped us onto a more stable patch of grassy marshland a few feet away.

He was an old man with a white beard, wearing a pair of rubber wading pants, that were completely covered in mud.

The serial killer! I thought to myself, before realizing that his voice sounded nothing like the tape's narrator, and that he could have easily killed us when we were stuck in the marsh, but didn't.

""We got lost."" I replied, careful not to offer up too much information.

""Thanks for saving us."" Jess added.

""You two are lucky I was out here.""

""What were you doing out here?"" I asked, suspicious of his why someone, besides us, would be out here in the marsh so late at night.

""Clammin.'"" He replied.

""Clammin'?"" Jess asked.

""I'm a clammer. Ain't nothin in the world that brings me as much solace as searching for clams at night. But anyways, you two better be getting back. I saw the man out there earlier.""

""The man?"" I asked.

""Yes, the man in the marsh."" He replied.

""Who's... that?"" Jess added.

""Us clammers and fishermen see him all the time, out there in the marsh. Always at night. And always digging away in the mud. Legend has it, he's the captain of that submerged boat out there, forever trying to free it.""

Jess and I both looked at each other, our eyes wide with fear.

""Anyways, I'd better be getting back. Low tide's upon us and there's clams to be clammed. You kids get home safe now.""

And like that, he was gone, disappearing into the fog like a ghost in the night.

But Jess and I were much more concerned with what he'd told us, than with the old man himself.

""We've gotta find Mike!"" Jess said frantically, as she turned to me, a look of panic in her eyes.

""Are you serious?"" I replied. ""But we agreed to head back. Mike made his choice to stay.""

""You heard the old man. There's someone else out there. We've gotta save him.""

""But-"" I began to say, before Jess grabbed me by the collar and interrupted.

""No buts, Tyler! These tapes found their way to you, not us. They chose you. You were the one who was meant to get us into this mess, and you are the one who's meant to get us out of it. So please, for crying out loud, put on your big boy pants, turn around, and be a hero for once in your life.""

I didn't know whether to feel hurt or flattered. All I knew was that she was right. I'd never really had much of a purpose in life before finding the tapes, and in a weird way, they gave me one. So I dusted off the dried mud from my clothes, took Jess by the hand, and set off into the foggy marshland.

‚Äî

When we finally arrived at the wreckage of the old boat, we found the nearby burial site completely excavated, the tape's third body protruding from the ground, and a box with what presumably was the next clue lying beside it.

And not far away, just lying there in the grass...

...Was Mike. Half alive, his body caught in an old bear trap, its rusty jaws clamping down into his torso, blood pouring out everywhere.

""I found the body."" He mumbled to Jess and I, as he noticed us approaching, blood dripping from his mouth.

""Mike!"" Jess screamed, as she started to run towards him, before I stopped her and crouched down to help him.

But no matter how hard I tried and tried... no matter how much force I put into it... the trap wouldn't release Mike from its grip.

Eventually, I stood up and took a few steps back, knowing that my friend would soon die from his wounds, as my own blood was now pouring from my arm.

Jess and I both knelt down by his side.

""I'm sorry... For what I said."" I whispered to him, as a tear rolled down my cheek.

""I'm sorry too."" He replied.

""Did someone do this to you?"" Jess asked.

""No."" Mike replied. ""I had just found the body, but couldn't see well, and accidentally stepped in the trap. But then a little while later, I did see him.""

""Who?"" Jess asked.

""The man from the tapes. He walked by and stood there for a minute, right where you were just standing. He looked at me for a moment, then just walked away and left me here to die.""

""The man in the marsh."" Jess said.

""Tell me something, Tyler."" Mike began, gesturing to the body. ""Is it him? Is it my dad?""

I sat there for a minute, not sure what to say, then moved the headphones from around my neck to my head, switched tape ""3"" for tape ""4"" and pressed play.

CLICK.

""If you're listening to this, you've found the third body. A widow, guilty of investing her entire life in that of another. Her husband, who, after sharing her life, her time, and her memories with, simply passed away one day. She should have known, as we've learned from the first two bodies, that love is not forever. And investing in it, a fool's errand. When you're ready for the directions to the next bodies, switch to the fifth tape.""

CLICK.

I looked at Mike as he lay there, dying in the grass, a hopeful look in his eye.

""It was him. It was your dad, Mike."" I said, unable to tell him the truth, and hoping the lie would bring him some sense of closure, some sense of solace, in his final moments.

He probably knew I was lying, but nevertheless... it brought a smile to his face.

""Thank you."" He mumbled, before his eyes eventually closed, and he passed on from this life.

Jess and I both began to cry our eyes out, as we sat there in the mud, our warm embrace counterpoint to the cold body that lay beside us.

""Maybe we should go back... and get help."" Jess said, sniffling, a sense of defeat in her voice.

""No,"" I replied, wiping the tears from my face. ""It's too late. We've gotta keep going. We've gotta find the bodies, and make this guy pay for what he's done.""

Jess reached over and helped me wrap my plaid shirt around my arm, in an effort to clot the wound, as I stared down at the ground, still processing what had just happened.

""Mike hated this shirt."" I said, unable to stop myself from letting out a laugh.

""He really did."" Jess replied, fighting a tearful chuckle of her own.

That's when I remembered the wooden box that I'd seen earlier, its structure identical to the one we'd found by the first two bodies.

I picked it up and opened it, revealing a piece of paper, with nothing but the letter ""A"" written on it.

""Another letter. ""A."""" I said.

""'J"" and ""A""."" Jess replied, ""What do you think it's spelling?""

""I have no idea.""

""Well, we'd better find the next one then.""

As the mist began to clear, and Jess looked out at the immense stretch of marshland that still lay before us, I switched tape ""4"" for tape ""5"" and pressed play.

More new stuff, well below Discogs. Still digging through a large buy and trying to make some floor space. Bunch of random test pressings that have yet to hit Discogs in this bunch. Included pics of those where appropriate. 

Everything ships from Boston and is a flat $5 to CONUS no matter how much you order. All vinyl is visually graded (media/sleeve) unless otherwise noted. Next mail run happens Tuesday, May 14th. If you're interested in anything, please contact me via¬†**CHAT ONLY**, please. No rainchecks, holds, etc.

~~**Bad Brains** [**I Against I** ](https://www.discogs.com/release/12374573-Bad-Brains-I-Against-I)(VG+/VG+) A faint paper scuff but nothing that affects play. **$30**~~

**Syd Barrett** [**Barrett (2014 Reissue)** ](https://www.discogs.com/release/5898039-Syd-Barrett-Barrett)(VG+/VG+) Vinyl and sleeve are very clean. **$21**

**Syd Barrett** [**Madcap Laughs (2014 Reissue)**](https://www.discogs.com/release/5869184-Syd-Barrett-The-Madcap-Laughs) (VG+/VG+) Grading the vinyl conservatively. It's very clean. Sleeve is sharp but there's a small (half-inch) seam split developing on the top. **$19**

**David Bowie** [**David Bowie (40th Anniversary Edition)**](https://www.discogs.com/release/2002701-David-Bowie-David-Bowie) (VG+/VG+) Vinyl is very clean. Jacket has minimal shelfwear. **$18**

**Czarface Double Dose Of Danger (Yellow, Test Pressing)** (VG+/VG+) So, this is a test-pressing of a yellow-vinyl version of Double Dose Of Danger that, if memory serves, never actually ended up coming out (think there were QC issues). I haven't listened to it all the way through, so there may very well be issues but it's a unique piece. Pics [here](https://imgur.com/a/iSE2PJI).  **$150**

**Dinosaur Jr.** [**You're Living All Over Me (Green)** ](https://www.discogs.com/release/5482649-Dinosaur-Jr-Youre-Living-All-Over-Me)(VG+/VG+) Vinyl is very clean with perhaps a faint cosmetic paper scuff from the inner. Sleeve has minimal shelfwear. **$40**

**Marvin Gaye** [**What's Going On (Yellow)**](https://www.discogs.com/release/6680192-Marvin-Gaye-Whats-Going-On) (VG+/VG+) So, the playing surface is near pristine and could be graded NM. The edge of the platter, however, has one uneven and wavy spot. It doesn't affect play and is purely cosmetic. **$25**

**Peter Laughner** [**Peter Laughner (4LP Box)**](https://www.discogs.com/release/13979128-Peter-Laughner-Peter-Laughner) (M/VG+) Factory-sealed copy.

665,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticdiscussions/comments/1cqy0ma/our_onceabundant_earth_protecting_species_from/,"Our Once-Abundant Earth: Protecting species from extinction is not nearly enough, by John Reid, The Atlantic ","Today. 

When Otis Parrish was a kid in the 1940s, abalone were abundant. Each abalone grows in a single, beautiful opalescent shell, which can get as big as a dinner plate. Parrish‚Äôs father showed him how to pry the abalone off the rocky shoreline at low tide with an oak stick or the end of a sharpened leaf spring. Or, best of all, how to take the abalone unawares and grab them with his bare hands before they had time to fasten tight to the rocks. His mother‚Äôs village was called Duka≈°al, or ‚ÄúAbaloneville‚Äù in the Kashaya Pomo tribe‚Äôs language, notwithstanding its location five miles and two steep ridges inland from Stewarts Point on the California coast. The ocean gave the Kashaya people protein and ceremonial food. ‚ÄúWe call [abalone] ‚ÄòChampion of the Sea,‚Äô‚Äù Parrish told me over coffee in nearby Windsor, California, one recent morning.

Newcomers to the state started eating abalone in far greater quantities in the mid-1800s. They went into deeper water with skiffs and long poles, and began free diving and subsequently diving from boats with air hoses to harvest the shellfish. Commercial capture passed 1 million pounds a year around 1920. Apart from a dip during World War II, abalone hauls totaled several million pounds a year for decades. When the pink-abalone population crashed in the early 1970s, people fished for more red abalone, whose decline, in turn, was compensated by increased pursuit of the green, white, and black species. They were all flatlining by the mid-1980s. In 1997, California banned commercial abalone fishing.

For years, red abalone was the only species sufficiently abundant to support even a limited recreational fishery. Tens of thousands of divers plucked nearly a quarter million abalone a year in Northern California. Then came 2017. Divers would pull abalone off the rocks only to find mostly empty shells. Scientists concluded that the abalone were starving because a record marine heat wave had weakened the kelp forest, and an epidemic, exacerbated by the hot water, killed more than 90 percent of sunflower sea stars from 2013 to 2017. Abalone and sunflower sea stars don‚Äôt have anything to do with each other directly, but the latter eat purple sea urchins, which eat kelp, which abalone also eat. When the sea-star population crashed, urchin numbers exploded, and a spiny purple horde clear-cut the remaining kelp. Biologists presumed that the abalone scooted around the rocks looking for their staple seaweed, found none, and perished. California‚Äôs last abalone fishery closed.

This story doesn‚Äôt involve extinction. Both abalone and sea stars still exist on this Earth. If we measure biodiversity as the number of species, nothing has changed. But red abalone, a species at least a few million years old that, during Otis Parrish‚Äôs youth and for at least eight millennia prior, required next to zero effort to gather, are now extraordinarily scarce. One California species, the pinto abalone, is ‚Äúendangered,‚Äù according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The remaining six species in the state are ‚Äúcritically endangered.‚Äù Sunflower sea stars, kelp forests, and many other species that live in the rocky coves along the California coast are in similar straits. They‚Äôve been displaced by hyperabundant purple urchins, which biologists are desperately trying to persuade humans, the predator of last resort, to eat.",13 May 2024 08:25:22,reddit

669,https://www.reddit.com/r/oldstories/comments/1cqrp9o/the_voice_in_the_night/,The Voice in the Night.,"It was a dark, starless night. We were becalmed in the Northern Pacific. Our exact position I do not know; for the sun had been hidden during the course of a weary, breathless week, by a thin haze which had seemed to float above us, about the height of our mastheads, at whiles descending and shrouding the surrounding sea.
With there being no wind, we had steadied the tiller, and I was the only man on deck. The crew, consisting of two men and a boy, were sleeping forward in their den, while Will‚Äîmy friend, and the master of our little craft‚Äîwas aft in his bunk on the port side of the little cabin.
Suddenly, from out of the surrounding darkness, there came a hail:
‚ÄúSchooner, ahoy!‚Äù
The cry was so unexpected that I gave no immediate answer, because of my surprise.
It came again‚Äîa voice curiously throaty and inhuman, calling from somewhere upon the dark sea away on our port broadside:
‚ÄúSchooner, ahoy!‚Äù
‚ÄúHullo!‚Äù I sung out, having gathered my wits somewhat. ‚ÄúWhat are you? What do you want?‚Äù
‚ÄúYou need not be afraid,‚Äù answered the queer voice, having probably noticed some trace of confusion in my tone. ‚ÄúI am only an old‚Äîman.‚Äù
The pause sounded odd, but it was only afterward that it came back to me with any significance.
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you come alongside, then?‚Äù I queried somewhat snappishly; for I liked not his hinting at my having been a trifle shaken.
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI‚Äîcan‚Äôt. It wouldn‚Äôt be safe. I‚Äî‚Äî‚Äù The voice broke off, and there was silence.
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù I asked, growing more and more astonished. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs not safe? Where are you?‚Äù
I listened for a moment; but there came no answer. And then, a sudden indefinite suspicion, of I knew not what, coming to me, I stepped swiftly to the binnacle and took out the lighted lamp. At the same time, I knocked on the deck with my heel to waken Will. Then I was back at the side, throwing the yellow funnel of light out into the silent immensity beyond our rail. As I did so, I heard a slight muffled cry, and then the sound of a splash, as though someone had dipped oars abruptly. Yet I cannot say with certainty that I saw anything; save, it seemed to me, that with the first flash of the light there had been something upon the waters, where now there was nothing.
‚ÄúHullo, there!‚Äù I called. ‚ÄúWhat foolery is this?‚Äù
But there came only the indistinct sounds of a boat being pulled away into the night.
Then I heard Will‚Äôs voice from the direction of the after scuttle:
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, George?‚Äù
‚ÄúCome here, Will!‚Äù I said.
‚ÄúWhat is it?‚Äù he asked, coming across the deck.
I told him the queer thing that had happened. He put several questions; then, after a moment‚Äôs silence, he raised his hands to his lips and hailed:
‚ÄúBoat, ahoy!‚Äù
From a long distance away there came back to us a faint reply, and my companion repeated his call. Presently, after a short period of silence, there grew on our hearing the muffled sound of oars, at which Will hailed again.
This time there was a reply: ‚ÄúPut away the light.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm damned if I will,‚Äù I muttered; but Will told me to do as the voice bade, and I shoved it down under the bulwarks.
‚ÄúCome nearer,‚Äù he said, and the oar strokes continued. Then, when apparently some half dozen fathoms distant, they again ceased.
‚ÄúCome alongside!‚Äù exclaimed Will. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to be frightened of aboard here.‚Äù
‚ÄúPromise that you will not show the light?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs to do with you,‚Äù I burst out, ‚Äúthat you‚Äôre so infernally afraid of the light?‚Äù
‚ÄúBecause‚Äî‚Äù began the voice, and stopped short.
‚ÄúBecause what?‚Äù I asked quickly.
Will put his hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúShut up a minute, old man,‚Äù he said, in a low voice. ‚ÄúLet me tackle him.‚Äù
He leaned more over the rail.
‚ÄúSee here, mister,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthis is a pretty queer business, you coming upon us like this, right out in the middle of the blessed Pacific. How are we to know what sort of a hanky-panky trick you‚Äôre up to? You say there‚Äôs only one of you. How are we to know, unless we get a squint at you‚Äîeh? What‚Äôs your objection to the light, anyway?‚Äù
As he finished, I heard the noise of the oars again, and then the voice came; but now from a greater distance, and sounding extremely hopeless and pathetic.
‚ÄúI am sorry‚Äîsorry! I would not have troubled you, only I am hungry, and‚Äîso is she.‚Äù
The voice died away, and the sound of the oars, dipping irregularly, was borne to us.
‚ÄúStop!‚Äù sang out Will. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to drive you away. Come back! We‚Äôll keep the light hidden, if you don‚Äôt like it.‚Äù
He turned to me:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a damned queer rig, this; but I think there‚Äôs nothing to be afraid of?‚Äù
There was a question in his tone, and I replied.
‚ÄúNo, I think the poor devil‚Äôs been wrecked around here, and gone crazy.‚Äù
The sound of the oars drew nearer.
‚ÄúShove that lamp back in the binnacle,‚Äù said Will; then he leaned over the rail and listened. I replaced the lamp and came back to his side. The dipping of the oars ceased some dozen yards distant.
‚ÄúWon‚Äôt you come alongside now?‚Äù asked Will in an even voice. ‚ÄúI have had the lamp put back in the binnacle.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚ÄîI cannot,‚Äù replied the voice. ‚ÄúI dare not come nearer. I dare not even pay you for the‚Äî the provisions.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right,‚Äù said Will, and hesitated. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to as much grub as you can take‚Äî‚Äù Again he hesitated.
‚ÄúYou are very good!‚Äù exclaimed the voice. ‚ÄúMay God, Who understands everything, reward you‚Äî‚Äù It broke off huskily.
‚ÄúThe‚Äîthe lady?‚Äù said Will abruptly. ‚ÄúIs she‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúI have left her behind upon the island,‚Äù came the voice.
‚ÄúWhat island?‚Äù I cut in.
‚ÄúI know not its name,‚Äù returned the voice. ‚ÄúI would to God‚Äî‚Äù it began, and checked itself as suddenly.
‚ÄúCould we not send a boat for her?‚Äù asked Will at this point.
‚ÄúNo!‚Äù said the voice, with extraordinary emphasis. ‚ÄúMy God! No!‚Äù There was a moment‚Äôs pause; then it added, in a tone which seemed a merited reproach:
‚ÄúIt was because of our want I ventured‚Äîbecause her agony tortured me.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am a forgetful brute!‚Äù exclaimed Will. ‚ÄúJust wait a minute, whoever you are, and I will bring you up something at once.‚Äù
In a couple of minutes he was back again, and his arms were full of various edibles. He paused at the rail.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt you come alongside for them?‚Äù he asked.
‚ÄúNo‚ÄîI dare not,‚Äù replied the voice, and it seemed to me that in its tones I detected a note of stifled craving‚Äîas though the owner hushed a mortal desire. It came to me then in a flash that the poor old creature out there in the darkness was suffering for actual need for that which Will held in his arms; and yet, because of some unintelligible dread, refraining from dashing to the side of our schooner and receiving it. And with the lightning-like conviction there came the knowledge that the Invisible was not mad, but sanely facing some intolerable horror.
‚ÄúDamn it, Will!‚Äù I said, full of many feelings, over which predominated a vast sympathy. ‚ÄúGet a box. We must float off the stuff to him in it.‚Äù
This we did, propelling it away from the vessel, out into the darkness, by means of a boat hook. In a minute a slight cry from the Invisible came to us, and we knew that he had secured the box.
A little later he called out a farewell to us, and so heartful a blessing, that I am sure we were the better for it. Then, without more ado, we heard the ply of oars across the darkness.
‚ÄúPretty soon off,‚Äù remarked Will, with perhaps just a little sense of injury.
‚ÄúWait,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI think somehow he‚Äôll come back. He must have been badly needing that food.‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd the lady,‚Äù said Will. For a moment he was silent; then he continued:
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the queerest thing ever I‚Äôve tumbled across since I‚Äôve been fishing.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said, and fell to pondering.
And so the time slipped away‚Äîan hour, another, and still Will stayed with me; for the queer adventure had knocked all desire for sleep out of him.
The third hour was three parts through when we heard again the sound of oars across the silent ocean.
‚ÄúListen!‚Äù said Will, a low note of excitement in his voice.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs coming, just as I thought,‚Äù I muttered.
The dipping of the oars grew nearer, and I noted that the strokes were firmer and longer. The food had been needed. They came to a stop a little distance off the broadside, and the queer voice came again to us through the darkness:
‚ÄúSchooner, ahoy!‚Äù
‚ÄúThat you?‚Äù asked Will.
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù replied the voice. ‚ÄúI left you suddenly, but‚Äîbut there was great need.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe lady?‚Äù questioned Will.
‚ÄúThe‚Äîlady is grateful now on earth. She will be more grateful soon in‚Äîin heaven.‚Äù
Will began to make some reply, in a puzzled voice; but became confused, and broke off short. I said nothing. I was wondering at the curious pauses, and, apart from my wonder, I was full of a great sympathy.
The voice continued:
‚ÄúWe‚Äîshe and I, have talked, as we shared the result of God‚Äôs tenderness and yours‚Äî‚Äù
Will interposed; but without coherence.
‚ÄúI beg of you not to‚Äîto belittle your deed of Christian charity this night,‚Äù said the voice. ‚ÄúBe sure that it has not escaped His notice.‚Äù
It stopped, and there was a full minute‚Äôs silence. Then it came again:
‚ÄúWe have spoken together upon that which‚Äîwhich has befallen us. We had thought to go out, without telling anyone of the terror which has come into our‚Äîlives. She is with me in believing that tonight‚Äôs happenings are under a special ruling, and that it is God‚Äôs wish that we should tell to you all that we have suffered since‚Äîsince‚Äî‚Äù
‚ÄúYes?‚Äù said Will softly.
‚ÄúSince the sinking of the Albatross.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh!‚Äù I exclaimed involuntarily. ‚ÄúShe left Newcastle for ‚ÄôFrisco some six months ago, and hasn‚Äôt been heard of since.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes‚Äù answered the voice. ‚ÄúBut some few degrees to the North of the line, she was caught in a terrible storm, and dismasted. When the day came, it was found that she was leaking badly, and, presently, it falling to a calm, the sailors took to the boats, leaving‚Äîleaving a young lady‚Äîmy fianc√©e‚Äîand myself upon the wreck.
‚ÄúWe were below, gathering together a few of our belongings, when they left. They were entirely callous, through fear, and when we came up upon the decks, we saw them only as small shapes afar off upon the horizon. Yet we did not despair, but set to work and constructed a small raft. Upon this we put such few matters as it would hold, including a quantity of water and some ship‚Äôs biscuit. Then, the vessel being very deep in the water, we got ourselves onto the raft and pushed off.
‚ÄúIt was later, when I observed that we seemed to be in the way of some tide or current, which bore us from the ship at an angle; so that in the course of three hours, by my watch, her hull became invisible to our sight, her broken masts remaining in view for a somewhat longer period. Then, towards evening, it grew misty, and so through the night. The next day we were still encompassed by the mist, the weather remaining quiet.
‚ÄúFor four days we drifted through this strange haze, until, on the evening of the fourth day, there grew upon our ears the murmur of breakers at a distance. Gradually it became plainer, and, somewhat after midnight, it appeared to sound upon either hand at no very great space. The raft was raised upon a swell several times, and then we were in smooth water, and the noise of the breakers was behind.
‚ÄúWhen the morning came, we found that we were in a sort of great lagoon; but of this we noticed little at the time; for close before us, through the enshrouding mist, loomed the hull of a large sailing vessel. With one accord, we fell upon our knees and thanked God, for we thought that here was an end to our perils. We had much to learn.
‚ÄúThe raft drew near to the ship, and we shouted on them to take us aboard; but none answered. Presently the raft touched against the side of the vessel, and seeing a rope hanging downward, I seized it and began to climb. Yet I had much ado to make my way up, because of a kind of grey, lichenous fungus that had seized upon the rope, and which blotched the side of the ship lividly.
‚ÄúI reached the rail and clambered over it, onto the deck. Here I saw that the decks were covered, in great patches, with grey masses, some of them rising into nodules several feet in height; but at the time I thought less of this matter than of the possibility of there being people aboard the ship. I shouted; but none answered. Then I went to the door below the poop deck. I opened it, and peered in. There was a great smell of staleness, so that I knew in a moment that nothing living was within, and with the knowledge, I shut the door quickly; for I felt suddenly lonely.
‚ÄúI went back to the side where I had scrambled up. My‚Äîmy sweetheart was still sitting quietly upon the raft. Seeing me look down, she called up to know whether there were any aboard of the ship. I replied that the vessel had the appearance of having been long deserted, but that if she would wait a little I would see whether there was anything in the shape of a ladder by which she could ascend to the deck. Then we would make a search through the vessel together. A little later, on the opposite side of the decks, I found a rope side ladder. This I carried across, and a minute afterwards she was beside me.
‚ÄúTogether we explored the cabins and apartments in the after part of the ship; but nowhere was there any sign of life. Here and there, within the cabins themselves, we came across odd patches of that queer fungus; but this, as my sweetheart said, could be cleansed away.
‚ÄúIn the end, having assured ourselves that the after portion of the vessel was empty, we picked our ways to the bows, between the ugly grey nodules of that strange growth; and here we made a further search, which told us that there was indeed none aboard but ourselves.
‚ÄúThis being now beyond any doubt, we returned to the stern of the ship and proceeded to make ourselves as comfortable as possible. Together we cleared out and cleaned two of the cabins; and after that I made examination whether there was anything eatable in the ship. This I soon found was so, and thanked God in my heart for His goodness. In addition to this I discovered the whereabouts of the fresh-water pump, and having fixed it, I found the water drinkable, though somewhat unpleasant to the taste.
‚ÄúFor several days we stayed aboard the ship, without attempting to get to the shore. We were busily engaged in making the place habitable. Yet even thus early we became aware that our lot was even less to be desired than might have been imagined; for though, as a first step, we scraped away the odd patches of growth that studded the floors and walls of the cabins and saloon, yet they returned almost to their original size within the space of twenty-four hours, which not only discouraged us but gave us a feeling of vague unease.
‚ÄúStill we would nor admit ourselves beaten, so set to work afresh, and not only scraped away the fungus but soaked the places where it had been with carbolic, a can-full of which I had found in the pantry. Yet, by the end of the week the growth had returned in full strength, and, in addition, it had spread to other places, as though our touching it had allowed germs from it to travel elsewhere.
‚ÄúOn the seventh morning, my sweetheart woke to find a small patch of it growing on her pillow, close to her face. At that, she came to me, as soon as she could get her garments upon her. I was in the galley at the time lighting the fire for breakfast.
‚Äú ‚ÄòCome here, John,‚Äô she said, and led me aft. When I saw the thing upon her pillow I shuddered, and then and there we agreed to go right out of the ship and see whether we could not fare to make ourselves more comfortable ashore.
‚ÄúHurriedly we gathered together our few belongings, and even among these I found that the fungus had been at work, for one of her shawls had a little lump of it growing near one edge. I threw the whole thing over the side without saying anything to her.
‚ÄúThe raft was still alongside, but it was too clumsy to guide, and I lowered down a small boat that hung across the stern, and in this we made our way to the shore. Yet, as we drew near to it, I became gradually aware that here the vile fungus, which had driven us from the ship, was growing riot. In places it rose into horrible, fantastic mounds, which seemed almost to quiver, as with a quiet life, when the wind blew across them. Here and there it took on the forms of vast fingers, and in others it just spread out flat and smooth and treacherous. Odd places, it appeared as grotesque stunted trees, seeming extraordinarily kinked and gnarled‚Äîthe whole quaking vilely at times. ‚ÄúAt first, it seemed to us that there was no single portion of the surrounding shore which was not hidden beneath the masses of the hideous lichen; yet, in this, I found we were mistaken; for somewhat later, coasting along the shore at a little distance, we descried a smooth white patch of what appeared to be fine sand, and there we landed. It was not sand. What it was I do not know. All that I have observed is that upon it the fungus will not grow; while everywhere else, save where the sand-like earth wanders oddly, path-wise, amid the grey desolation of the lichen, there is nothing but that loathsome greyness.
‚ÄúIt is difficult to make you understand how cheered we were to find one place that was absolutely free from the growth, and here we deposited our belongings. Then we went back to the ship for such things as it seemed to us we should need. Among other matters, I managed to bring ashore with me one of the ship‚Äôs sails, with which I constructed two small tents, which, though exceedingly rough-shaped, served the purposes for which they were intended. In these we lived and stored our various necessities, and thus for a matter of some four weeks all went smoothly and without particular unhappiness. Indeed, I may say with much happiness‚Äîfor‚Äîfor we were together.
‚ÄúIt was on the thumb of her right hand that the growth first showed. It was only a small circular spot, much like a little grey mole. My God! how the fear leaped to my heart when she showed me the place. We cleansed it, between us, washing it with carbolic and water. In the morning of the following day she showed her hand to me again. The grey warty thing had returned. For a little while we looked at one another in silence. Then, still wordless, we started again to remove it. In the midst of the operation she spoke suddenly.
‚Äú ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that on the side of your face, dear?‚Äô Her voice was sharp with anxiety. I put my hand up to feel.
‚Äú ‚ÄòThere! Under the hair by your ear. A little to the front a bit.‚Äô My finger rested upon the place, and then I knew.
‚Äú ‚ÄòLet us get your thumb done first,‚Äô I said. And she submitted, only because she was afraid to touch me until it was cleansed. I finished washing and disinfecting her thumb, and then she turned to my face. After it was finished we sat together and talked awhile of many things; for there had come into our lives sudden, very terrible thoughts. We were, all at once, afraid of something worse than death. We spoke of loading the boat with provisions and water and making our way out onto the sea; yet we were helpless, for many causes, and‚Äîand the growth had attacked us already. We decided to stay. God would do with us what was His will. We would wait.
‚ÄúA month, two months, three months passed and the places grew somewhat, and there had come others. Yet we fought so strenuously with the fear that its headway was but slow, comparatively speaking.
‚ÄúOccasionally we ventured off to the ship for such stores as we needed. There we found that the fungus grew persistently. One of the nodules on the main deck soon became as high as my head.
‚ÄúWe had now given up all thought or hope of leaving the island. We had realized that it would be unallowable to go among healthy humans, with the things from which we were suffering.
‚ÄúWith this determination and knowledge in our minds we knew that we should have to husband our food and water; for we did not know, at that time, but that we should possibly live for many years.
‚ÄúThis reminds me that I have told you that I am an old man. Judged by years this is not so. But‚Äîbut‚Äî‚Äù
He broke off; then continued somewhat abruptly:
‚ÄúAs I was saying, we knew that we should have to use care in the matter of food. But we had no idea then how little food there was left of which to take care. It was a week later that I made the discovery that all the other bread tanks‚Äîwhich I had supposed full‚Äîwere empty, and that (beyond odd tins of vegetables and meat, and some other matters) we had nothing on which to depend, but the bread in the tank which I had already opened.
‚ÄúAfter learning this I bestirred myself to do what I could, and set to work at fishing in the lagoon; but with no success. At this I was somewhat inclined to feel desperate until the thought came to me to try outside the lagoon, in the open sea.
‚ÄúHere, at times, I caught odd fish, but so infrequently that they proved of but little help in keeping us from the hunger which threatened. It seemed to me that our deaths were likely to come by hunger, and not by the growth of the thing which had seized upon our bodies.
‚ÄúWe were in this state of mind when the fourth month wore out. Then I made a very horrible discovery. One morning, a little before midday, I came off from the ship with a portion of the biscuits which were left. In the mouth of her tent I saw my sweetheart sitting, eating something.
‚Äú ‚ÄòWhat is it, my dear?‚Äô I called out as I leaped ashore. Yet, on hearing my voice, she seemed confused, and, turning, slyly threw something toward the edge of the little clearing. It fell short, and a vague suspicion having arisen within me, I walked across and picked it up. It was a piece of the grey fungus.
‚ÄúAs I went to her with it in my hand, she turned deadly pale; then a rose red.
‚ÄúI felt strangely dazed and frightened.
‚Äú ‚ÄòMy dear! My dear!‚Äô I said, and could say no more. Yet at my words she broke down and cried bitterly. Gradually, as she calmed, I got from her the news that she had tried it the preceding day, and‚Äîand liked it. I got her to promise on her knees not to touch it again, however great our hunger. After she had promised, she told me that the desire for it had come suddenly, and that, until the moment of desire, she had experienced nothing toward it but the most extreme repulsion.
‚ÄúLater in the day, feeling strangely restless and much shaken with the thing which I had discovered, I made my way along one of the twisted paths‚Äîformed by the white, sand-like substance‚Äîwhich led among the fungoid growth. I had, once before, ventured along there; but not to any great distance. This time, being involved in perplexing thought, I went much farther than hitherto. ‚ÄúSuddenly I was called to myself by a queer hoarse sound on my left. Turning quickly I saw that there was movement among an extraordinarily shaped mass of fungus, close to my elbow. It was swaying uneasily, as though it possessed life of its own. Abruptly, as I stared, the thought came to me that the thing had a grotesque resemblance to the figure of a distorted human creature. Even as the fancy flashed into my brain, there was a slight, sickening noise of tearing, and I saw that one of the branchlike arms was detaching itself from the surrounding grey masses, and coming toward me. The head of the thing‚Äîa shapeless grey ball, inclined in my direction. I stood stupidly, and the vile arm brushed across my face. I gave out a frightened cry, and ran back a few paces. There was a sweetish taste upon my lips where the thing had touched me. I licked them, and was immediately filled with an inhuman desire. I turned and seized a mass of the fungus. Then more, and‚Äîmore. I was insatiable. In the midst of devouring, the remembrance of the morning‚Äôs discovery swept into my mazed brain. It was sent by God. I dashed the fragment I held to the ground. Then, utterly wretched and feeling a dreadful guiltiness, I made my way back to the little encampment.
‚ÄúI think she knew, by some marvelous intuition which love must have given, so soon as she set eyes on me. Her quiet sympathy made it easier for me, and I told her of my sudden weakness, yet omitted to mention the extraordinary thing which had gone before. I desired to spare her all unnecessary terror.
‚ÄúBut, for myself, I had added an intolerable knowledge, to breed an incessant terror in my brain; for I doubted not but that I had seen the end of one of these men who had come to the island in the ship in the lagoon; and in that monstrous ending I had seen our own.
‚ÄúThereafter we kept from the abominable food, though the desire for it had entered into our blood. Yet our drear punishment was upon us; for, day by day, with monstrous rapidity, the fungoid growth took hold of our poor bodies. Nothing we could do would check it materially, and so‚Äîand so‚Äîwe who had been human became‚ÄîWell, it matters less each day. Only‚Äîonly we had been man and maid!
‚ÄúAnd day by day the fight is more dreadful, to withstand the hunger-lust for the terrible lichen.
‚ÄúA week ago we ate the last of the biscuit, and since that time I have caught three fish. I was out here fishing tonight when your schooner drifted upon me out of the mist. I hailed you. You know the rest, and may God, out of His great heart, bless you for your goodness to a‚Äîa couple of poor outcast souls.‚Äù
There was the dip of an oar‚Äîanother. Then the voice came again, and for the last time, sounding through the slight surrounding mist, ghostly and mournful.
‚ÄúGod bless you! Good-bye!‚Äù
‚ÄúGood-bye,‚Äù we shouted together hoarsely, our hearts full of many emotions.
I glanced about me. I became aware that the dawn was upon us.
The sun flung a stray beam across the hidden sea; pierced the mist dully, and lit up the receding boat with a gloomy fire. Indistinctly I saw something nodding between the oars. I thought of a sponge‚Äîa great, grey nodding sponge‚Äî The oars continued to ply. They were grey‚Äîas was the boat‚Äîand my eyes searched a moment vainly for the conjunction of hand and oar. My gaze flashed back to the‚Äîhead. It nodded forward as the oars went backward for the stroke. Then the oars were dipped, the boat shot out of the patch of light, and the‚Äîthe thing went nodding into the mist.",13 May 2024 01:27:50,reddit

671,https://www.reddit.com/r/HonkaiStarRail/comments/1cqpr0s/penacony_after_almost_everything_is_said_and_done/,"Penacony, after (almost) everything is said and done: Honest opinion. (With some spoilers)","OK, this may feel like one more ""Am I the only one"" post, but, I'll do my best to at least make sure it's not how it comes off as.

  
Tl;dr: While I adored most of what Penacony had to offer, the simplistic way the final confrontation dealt with its themes rubbed me the wrong way. That and Firefly kinda sucks, and was just feels bait we all fell for.



Now onto the post.

  
After the mess that was Xianzhou, and after several trailers, I was pretty hyped up about Penacony. A land of dreams, with intrigue and splendour, the type of whimsy melded with the underlying horror Hoyo is known for... Yeah, I was looking forward to it. To the point of not sleeping the night before just so I could be up in time... Also, Black Swan. When it came... I wasn't disappointed. Sure, fatigue made so much of it a bit worse than it could have been, especially the puzzles and challenges, but, even with that, it was gripping, it was... It was what I wanted from the game from the start. A story that hits the ground running and doesn't stop, expecting you to follow along... Until it does and it gives you time to digest. The only real bad thing about 2.0 were the 2.1 spoilers about Firefly and how she was indeed SAM (I hoped against hope that they would be separate, but it was not be to be. From the general plot to the characters, all of them brought something to the table and made sure my time in Penacony stayed as engaging and enjoyable as possible. All in all, to me, 2.0 was a VERY strong start to a new arc in the story. One that got me hooked for more. The events tided me  over enough that the grind was at least tolerable.

  
Then comes 2.1, Acheron, and more of the story. More of the same, and even more development, but this is where the cracks began to show for me. The PoV switches were, while interesting, a tad overbearing, and even if I do see the point of them, I could have done without. The plot thickened in ways that were certainly enjoyable again, but not as much as 2.0. For me, though, the high point of it all was Aventurine's story. I liked his swagger, even if he was annoying, and seeing where he came from, made him that much more real. A true underdog willing to bet it all to get ahead with his plans. His ""death"" was well-orchestrated, and certainly deserving of the act he put on to pull it off... And then... We get to SAM... Or Firefly, and 2.2.

  
Not going to lie, from the moment it was revealed SAM is Firefly, I didn't want anything to do with Firefly anymore. I felt betrayed by her act. Nothing she said held truth... For two reasons: She was never really in danger, and she tried to put us into the ground. Regardless of reasons, this isn't something I want in a friendly acquaintance. In fact, just thinking about it, makes me a bit mad that you aren't allowed to even hold a grudge against her for her actions and what they meant regarding you. You can call her out on it ONCE, and then you move on. Would it have killed her to just say ""Don't worry, I'm alive, but I can't exactly come see you at the moment, I'll explain as soon as I can.""? Yes? Well, fuck us as players, I guess. That was a cheap shot, and it will never be anything else. And the whole ""she sacrificed her life to get you the intel needed to wake everyone up"" later on is pure bullshit. Meta reason being that Hoyo doesn't release dead characters as playable. Never did, never will. Other, more ""in-universe"" reason, is that that would only be her second death. Way to go, Hoyo, defusing the tension before it could even rise. Back to the story... The Misha/Mikhail subplot was beautiful, not going to lie, and really, I felt a bit sad that Misha would never come with us, since he's only a memory. The game show bit was boring, and since I was doing it with someone I just didn't care for, I just wanted it to be done and over with. Finally it was, and soon after, we get to my favorite non-playable so far, Sunday.

  
The story of Sunday and Robin is one that is simple, but still works pretty well. Two orphan siblings that, due to circumstances, end up developping starkly different worldviews that aren't necessarily wrong, but, on their own, incomplete. One yearns to reach all with her voice and music to give hope and spur people to not give up and to strive for a better life even if it fails, as to not fall to nihility, while the other would rather shelter those he sees as flawed and weak from a world he has known to be harsh, even if it means clipping their wings and even if it means having to shoulder the cost that said protection would entail. One has seen the best life could create, the other, the worst. This has shaped them, even as young as they are... But, the way Sunday's argument and cause is dismissed simply because ""it wouldn't be real"" is pretty simplistic, and I would say, shallow. It argues from a position of potential realised, disregarding that it takes a great deal of luck to even get there in the first place. Not everyone is this lucky, and most, in trying to get to this shining life, would just crash, fall, and in the end, perish forgotten, their life filled with regrets. That isn't to say giving up and accepting things is the right choice, but, there is a middle ground in there that just isn't explored. Even when Robin is shown people that don't have the choice but to accept that their life sucks without any means to make it better, she laments their choice to live in the dream, arguing that nothing would get better for them this way... Well, yea. They're doomed anyway. Let them live what they have left the way they want to. The entire back and forth that follows when Sunday/Gopher's plan is revealed is kind of lowbrow too. They try arguing from the position of the weak but willful, but the thing is... None of them are weak, in any sense of the word. They either have force of will, force of mind, or force of arms. Any of which would guide them to strive and not give up. True weakness is giving up, and so, they cannot be called weak. I expected more, and the more this stretch of the story went, the less immersed I was, and the more I was reminded that these people are just characters in a story I'm not part of.

  
Some have likened this plot to P5R and Maruki's plan. I'd also liken it to P4's Izanami plot. Except that, rather than just people being made to sleep with virtually nothing changing for them (most wouldn't want to wake up anyway, if sunk into a dream of eternal respite and felicity, because they would have no real notion of the opposite), we're shown that it wouldn't last. They'd just become shadows and die. Another, very apt comparison is The Matrix. The dream of Order is the blue pill. An illusion of normalcy, happiness and no need to know the truth, while the red pill is the bitter struggle for freedom and ""true happiness"" by reclaiming your life from those who would keep you trapped for any reason. In this there is also a difference in final intent. Protection against cold resource harvesting.

  
I may be wrong to think that, but Sunday's plan, on paper, was sound, and would have been valid, had he just asked people if they wanted an eternity in the dream, or to wake up now. Penacony IS successful, after all. Using the stellaron, though, was dodgy at best... But all that doesn't deter from the fact that the protags didn't refute anything and just went with ""you're wrong because I don't agree with you"" (Only one I could agree with in the train one-liners is Dan Heng's ""Your have a noble soul. Don't let the past shackle you"". This one appeals to the fact that Sunday could do better, if only he lets himself move forward. Anyone else is just going with feel-good lines.

  
In the end, the finale kind of soured the experience to me... Though, it was much worse for me when I first finished it. I'm better about it now, seeing that the execution of the final boss was stellar, but it won't be the same. I'll still pull for Firefly, but, she kind of is lesser. I can appreciate sketchy characters, but I hate those that just are dishonest (And saying that she didn't have the time to tell you... Nah, a simple text takes less than an hour to send. She just didn't want to).

  
This is it. Lots of yapping for probably nothing. I'm expecting downvotes. In fact, there is more I'd want to say, but this is long enough, so, I'll keep it at that. It's just fluff about previous points anyway.",12 May 2024 23:30:48,reddit

673,https://www.reddit.com/r/summonerschool/comments/1cqogdr/misdirection_the_1_underrated_strategy_for_this/,Misdirection: The 1 UNDERRATED Strategy for this game,"I've made a video that explores the strategic concept of misdirection in League of Legends, using Orianna as an example.

Watch the video here (Recommended): [https://youtu.be/b3RsgQ77wc4](https://youtu.be/b3RsgQ77wc4)



-----------------------------------------------------

If you don't feel like watching, here is the info:



Have you ever been so engrossed in something that you fail to notice what was happening right in front of you? That's misdirection in action! It's the art of drawing attention away from what's truly important, and it's used in magic acts, mystery novels, and even real-life situations. If you are looking for an edge to outsmart your opponents in League of Legends, misdirection can also help with that. It‚Äôs something that many League players overlook so if you manage to master misdirection, it can really help you turn the tide and climb.

In this video, I will cover three types of misdirection that can lead us to sweet victory. I will be using Orianna to demonstrate this but keep in mind that misdirection is a strategy so it‚Äôs not about the champion, it‚Äôs about the way of thinking.

The first type of misdirection is visual misdirection. Visual misdirection involves making our opponent look here and not there.

If we are laning with Orianna and we are trying to land our Q, we will have a better shot if we Q in one direction but walk in the other direction as opposed to just standing still and throwing our Q. This is because the former involves visual misdirection while the latter doesn‚Äôt. In order to visually misdirect our opponent, we first need a red herring. In this case, our red herring is our own body movement. When we move, we divert our enemy‚Äôs attention, thereby creating the perfect opportunity for us to throw the ball. Additionally, players who understand zoning and spacing tend to instinctively adjust their positioning in response to our movement so we can kinda anticipate their moves when we Q this way.

Bigger actions can often conceal smaller actions. The bigger the action, the better the concealment. This is why magicians use magic wands‚Äîit amplifies their gestures beyond what they can achieve with their hands alone.

The second type of misdirection is time misdirection. Time misdirection involves making our opponent think that something is going to happen at a certain time when it‚Äôs not. One way to use time misdirection in our games is to pretend that we are trying to hit the enemy with our abilities, then back off and then immediately throw our abilities at them.

Many players will try to hit their abilities by walking up to the enemy and making a forced move. This is not always a good idea because the enemy knows that we are going to hit them so they will be more prepared to dodge. Trying to throw our abilities immediately after we retreat can yield more success because we are misleading the enemy into thinking that we have already given up.

Time misdirection works well because human‚Äôs limited perception often generates false causal links between two events. In our example, the two events would be backing off and giving up. This is how magicians make stuff disappear. We think the object is disappearing right now in front of us, when in fact the magician probably did something to the object at another time.

The third type of misdirection is psychological misdirection. It involves making our opponent think something is going to happen this way, when it‚Äôs going to happen another way. Mystery novels that use the narrative technique of revealing the victim as the culprit are often crafted with the clever use of psychological misdirection.

Psychological misdirection works well because we are manipulating the perception of our motives and intent, leading our opponent down a path of false assumptions.

You might know about the hiding the ball in the terrain trick if you play Orianna‚ÄîI made a video about it many many years ago. One way to use the hiding ball trick is to combine it with psychological misdirection.

For example, we can hide our ball here and then walk up to the enemy this way. This might make the enemy think that we are going to Q this way when we are actually going to Q this way (We can surprise our enemy by doing this).",12 May 2024 22:20:40,reddit
674,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/1cqnfru/musician_theme_next_for_next_season/,Musician theme next for next season? üßôüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ,"I think it would be really cool to see a season about the music industry since every season has had such a huge influence from the music throughout time. 

Ax Man/jazz in Coven, Charles Manson in Murder House, Misty‚Äôs love for Stevie Nicks (and Stevie being a witch üòç), hip hop beefs and disco in Hotel, desire for greatness in Red Tide with the violin, bathhouses in NYC, sixties bops in Asylum, obsession with Billy Idol in 1984 (comment more examples if you think of them‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt want to ramble too long!). 

BUT‚Ä¶it would be a great way to include everyone from the cast and there‚Äôs so much to touch upon throughout the last 100 years of American history and pop culture. Would be cool to see big band orchestras, hip hop beefs, golden era Hollywood musicals, obsessive stalkers, and darker Marilyn Manson type musicians, Diddy stuff, etc. I feel like that‚Äôs one of the few ways to really tie in every single season and weave a clear picture. 

PS‚ÄîI think Delicate was pure camp as far as Kim and Taylor Swift drama‚Ä¶SO with Travis Kelsce being part of season 13 (apparently Taylor Swift‚Äôs favorite number) it could be a possibility that this season will be campy and witchy but ~Taylor‚Äôs version~",12 May 2024 21:27:34,reddit

Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hiroshima ","Hello everyone, we are a American couple going to Japan for the first time and are beyond excited! To give some context, we are late 20 year olds with a high level of energy and are not afraid to walk a lot and live a day to the fullest even if we are exhausted by night time. We are interested in nature, architecture, technology, and history. Not interested at all in things like shopping or anime. Let me know what you think of the itinerary.

Times are also super approximate, and are more just used in planning to let me know what was possible, I don't plan on living by a strict schedule or anything. I pretty extensively planned and looked in commute times and average times spent at things for everything so I am fairly confident the schedule is possible, but would still love insight!.

678,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/1cqa2ud/ahs_ranking_my_best_to_worst_with_brief/,AHS Ranking - my best to worst with brief explanations. ,"1. Asylum - stellar acting, genuinely scary location, shocking moments and twists

2. Coven - scary and camp done well, with an iconic cast (Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, etc!)

3. Apocalypse - a fun crossover with new energy. Leslie Grossman and Cody Fern stood out to me this season

4. Roanoke - the first very jumpy season in a while and a close return to form imo (albeit I‚Äôm still not sure how I feel about the show within a show twist - it changes). Adina Porter was excellent

5. 1984 - fun and campy, if a little unevenly paced. Billie Lourd was great

6. Freakshow - scary and had some depth, but left me feeling uncomfortable. It felt like Jessica Lange was being typecast despite her great talent. Finn Wittrock and Frances Conroy were epic

These are my consistent top 6, but it was harder for me to rank the other seasons as I have a similar (or at least comparable) level of enthusiasm for a lot of them. But, right now‚Ä¶

7. Red Tide - to me, this felt like a strange season that didn‚Äôt seem to go anywhere for a while, but praise to Finn Wittrock and Lily Rabe (they‚Äôre the only reason this season is ranked higher than others). Macauley Culkin was a fun addition 

8. Cult - Sarah Paulson was great but I thought the material was weak. It felt like the season was mostly just her in a house being scared. I think so much more could‚Äôve been done with the theme

9. Hotel - style over substance and the beginning of the decline for me. Praise to Chloe Sevigny, Sarah Paulson and Denis O‚ÄôHare though

10. Death Valley - I found the season very confusing and out there, but I appreciated the show really thinking outside the box. Sarah Paulson and Cody Fern were great

11. Murder House - I tried to like it, as I know it‚Äôs a fan favourite, but I found myself feeling more bored, depressed and unsettled by it than spooked and entertained 

12. NYC - I got bored of frivolous scenes, and it took a while for the storyline to get going, imo. Charlie Carver brought some good wholesome energy though

13. Delicate - Emma Roberts and Kim Kardashian were great, but the writing (Kim‚Äôs lines appeared to have been written to go viral) and pacing didn‚Äôt work for me and the ending felt peculiar and abrupt. I think the supporting cast was so underused too. I‚Äôm surprised Leslie Grossman agreed to play the minor role she did

What would your ranking be?

679,https://www.reddit.com/r/moderatelygranolamoms/comments/1cqa0vg/reusable_diapers_causing_a_rash/,Reusable diapers causing a rash? ,"I used reusable diapers with my first son and now with my second son (he will be 5 months next week). At around 2 months we went to exclusively reusable diapers. About 2 weeks ago I noticed small red dots all over his bum and that has escalated to a full red rash. For the past few days, I used exclusively disposal diapers and it cleared up almost 100%. Just yesterday I went back to reusables and by mid-day his bum was very red and spotty again. 

So now I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else has had an issue with reusables bothering their babies bums? I rinse before I wash them and do an extra rinse in the washer before drying. I didn‚Äôt change detergents and have followed the same steps I did with my first son for cleaning/using/changing him. 

I use tide pure clean plant based and have been thinking about switching detergents anyway. I‚Äôve stuck with this one because of how well it gets the diapers clean- no musty or stinky smell, they come out great. 

Any thoughts or suggestions are appreciated, I love using reusable diapers and would like to get my guy back in them without a rash forming!

680,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1cq9xuu/unlucky_isekai_life/,Unlucky Isekai Life,"Jason Alexander Coyle was dead‚Ä¶ Again.¬† Gods‚Äô above this was such an inconvenience.¬† And he hadn‚Äôt even managed to go out in some cool display of power and glory.¬† Nooooo, he had died to a MOTHER‚Ä¶ F\*\*\*ING‚Ä¶ DEMI-HUMAN.¬† A GODS‚Äô DAMNED GOBLIN of all things.¬† The sheer audacity of it caused him to wallow in shame and seethe in rage.¬† He closed his eyes and once more replayed the events leading up to his downfall.¬† The disgusting little thing hadn‚Äôt even had the decency to best him in combat.¬† No, that vile puss skinned whelp had played dead, then stabbed Jason in the back once the battle was over.¬†

¬†

Grarothian Powder. Clever little shit. Cover yourself in that stuff and all Jason‚Äôs magically enhanced senses meant nothing. He should have known better.¬† I mean, if no one could sense your vitals, what difference was there really between you and just another corpse littering the battlefield?¬† How hadn‚Äôt he thought of something so simple?¬† How had he been outsmarted by a goblin?!¬†

¬†¬†

The powder was a common enough anti magical tool in that world.¬† A light layer was often applied to armor and weapons as a means to disperse the effects of magic.¬† Strong enough to save you from an otherwise lethal direct hit of a lesser spell, it was more often more useful as a protection from splash effects of a fireball or other large area of effect spells.¬† A nasty sunburn or a few bruised ribs tends to be more acceptable than third-degree burns or being impaled when your mate got turned into a dystopian bit of shrubbery or an ice sculpture. ¬† The problem is that once it does its job, the stuff crumbles away.¬† So, most soldiers had taken to carrying around pouches of the stuff, reapplying it before making any mad dashes towards enemy spell casters.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

It had been a work of absolute genius, or more likely dumb luck, that the creature had been coated in the stuff.¬† Jason was hard pressed to believe that a sub sapient mongrel was smart enough to come up with such an elaborate plan.¬† He further suspected luck, given that even wild animals knew to avoid heavy direct contact with the stuff, much less to risk ingesting it.¬† Doing so caused a fast-acting cancer to take hold.¬† He‚Äôd once had the unfortunate experience of seeing a street mutt be pelted with a full pouch of the stuff.¬† Covered the dog in a heavy bit of powder, but also coated the food the pup had been feasting on.¬† Poor bastard had been found dead the next morning.¬† Apparently, it had developed multiple melon sized tumors in the twelve or so hours between when Jason had last seen it, and its body being found.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Then there was the matter of how the goblin had somehow managed to get its grubby little mitts on a Dathon Disrupter blade.¬† Jason had little doubt the weapon was looted from one of the fallen kingdom soldiers.¬† The maggot‚Äôs simplistic animal-like brain must have been captivated by how sparkly the blade was.¬† If he understood goblins even half as well as he thought, the stupid little thing was probably straining its brain to understand that the thing it had picked up was both shiny, AND sharp.¬† ‚ÄúShiny made it valuable, and anything sharp was good for stabbing.‚Äù¬† That was the extent of how deep the goblin's thinking went, Jason was sure.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Sure, if he had noticed the creature, the blade would have been useless against his omnidirectional invincibility.¬† He‚Äôd seen much finer weapons shatter when they came into contact with his protective abilities.¬† BUT, despite what people might think, all those superhuman protections had a stifling cost.¬† And what kind of insane fool bothered to keep invincibility turned on when everyone who was anyone of importance in the area was deader than a doornail.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

He could still remember the metallic iron taste in the back of his throat as his lungs had filled with blood.¬† He‚Äôd of course tried to heal himself, but the disruptor had done its job.¬† Jason‚Äôs ability to cast magic had been rendered entirely useless, the arcane energies coming apart as he tried to weave them into even the simplest of spells.¬† The only small justice he could find in the situation was that the assailant had botched their landing.¬† He could only assume the beast had thought the surprise would paralyze him, while he drowned in his own fluids.¬† If that had been the first or even fifth time he‚Äôd died, the little monster would have been correct.¬† The realization that you are dying, and there‚Äôs nothing you can do about it, was a hell of a thing to cope with.¬† Lucky for Jason, you kind of got ‚Äòbetter‚Äô at handling the whole impending demise thing, after you‚Äôd faced death a dozen times.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

The time bought from NOT having your life flash before your eyes, had given him just enough of an opportunity to land a heavy haymaker against the goblin.¬† It wasn‚Äôt the cleanest of blows, but it still brought a smile to his face remembering the feeling of the creature‚Äôs bones breaking under his empowered fist.¬† He wasn‚Äôt sure if it had been enough to kill the thing, but he did know that if it didn‚Äôt kill the goblin, it had at least permanently crippled the right side of the beast.¬† Watching the goblin crumple, then begin to twitch, had been the best sight he could imagine as his world faded to blackness.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

When he next opened his eyes, he was sitting in his usual seat within the Agency.¬† The room was sparsely decorated, he‚Äôd never really seen the point in investing in decorations for a place that held such... complex, emotional significance.¬† Much less a place that he did his best to spend as little time in as possible.¬† Jason was a bit annoyed that his handler wasn‚Äôt present to greet him, but then she was never good at doing her job.¬† Sighing, he leaned back in the chair and waited, he knew that she had been paged when he arrived, and he also knew the door wouldn‚Äôt open until he had submitted his mission summary.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Ruby had of course lost her metaphorical shit when Jason arrived back at the Agency.¬† The bloody lush had laughed herself into a mini coma when she learned that a lowly goblin, using a glorified butter knife, had been the thing to bring Jason down.¬† Gods, he hated her, no matter when he ran into her, she always reeked like she‚Äôd just gotten done bathing in a pool of liquor.¬† He was still not really sure WHERE or HOW she got her hands on Earth booze.¬† Plucking a soul from Earth was troublesome enough, but trying to get physical objects from the place?¬† That was far beyond even Ruby‚Äôs power.¬† He did know for a fact that it was Earth liquor, and not some kind of divine proximity, since he‚Äôd yet to find a single bar in the entirety of the Agency.¬† Hell, he‚Äôd yet to find another being that even understood what alcohol was.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

After recovering enough that she could breathe without wheezing, Ruby had gone ahead and made sure that the contract hadn‚Äôt been refunded due to Jason‚Äôs untimely demise.¬† As luck would have it, it did appear that he had fulfilled just enough of the order so that the client could still be charged for services rendered.¬† Which meant that Jason got his commission, a fair bit smaller than he would have liked after all the fees, but that was the cost one paid to subvert the usual limitations of a mortal body.¬† Not that it mattered, that last job had finally put him over the top.¬† After dozens upon dozens of quests, Jason had finally managed to scrape together enough to buy what he‚Äôd been lusting after since he first woke up in this shithole.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

A mad smile curled on his lips, as he opened up the shop screen.¬† Navigating through dozens of pages of bog-standard contracts, an asinine level of ads for luxury services, and more high-class cuisine than he could eat in a thousand thousand lifetimes, he finally found the loose thread he had been looking for.¬† Dragging his finger along the lower left-hand side of the screen, he made a series of increasingly complex designs.¬† With a click the screen faded away to a new darker overlay.¬† Moving quickly, he bought the token he was looking for and slipped out of the system.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

He‚Äôd stumbled across the dark site ages ago, while killing time between missions.¬† The prices were exorbitant if not outright extortive in nature.¬† But it did give one access to certain... choices that would not have otherwise been accessible via the normal shop.¬† It was why Jason had bought the system admin privileges, he needed to access the real good shit.¬† Sure, the base shop allowed agents to pick their own assignments, but the good missions, well those could only be accessed by the admin staff AKA handlers.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

The biggest issue was that management did not take too kindly to their staff‚Äôs access codes being used by unauthorized individuals.¬† This meant that Jason only had a limited amount of time to peruse the catalog before the system would kick him out and block that access code from being used again.¬† He‚Äôd had to burn through three different sets of privileges before he found what he was looking for.¬† A modifiable mission token for an honest to goodness Isekai.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

The fact that Isekai were even a real thing, had thrown Jason for a bit of a loop.¬† Well, perhaps more the fact that he had died in a tragic way that even the gods couldn‚Äôt seem to explain, and all he‚Äôd gotten for his trouble was a small ‚Äúsign on bonus''.¬† Not that he was complaining too much, the limited New Game+ skill had proven useful in more than one mission.¬† But apparently, some people got a date with Truck-kun and suddenly they are given an entire freaking wish fulfillment fantasy.¬† He would have pissed and moaned to upper management but thought better of it when he remembered that he only knew what he knew by using exploits within the system. ¬† There had been rumors about what happened to those who had their access codes stolen, it was not pleasant, and he didn‚Äôt want to imagine what would happen if people found out who had been using those stolen codes.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

As Ruby droned on and on about whatever it was that drunk was talking about.¬† Jason began calibrating the token to his specifications.¬† The basic token itself had drained an exceedingly large amount of his credits, Isekai missions were... difficult to get a hold of, even for handlers, but it was the add-ons that were really going to strain his budget.¬† He tapped through the various options.¬† It wouldn‚Äôt be a proper Isekai without the deluxe harem package.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

After the cluster fuck that was his last mission, he decided to take things on easy mode for his wish fulfillment.¬† It was insanely costly, but the entire Divine Protection suite made him resistant if not straight up immune to every offensive ability that could reasonably be thrown at him.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Can‚Äôt live out your hero fantasy dreams without having to crush a Demon Lord.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

He had deeply enjoyed the incarnations where he had had access to magic.¬† But he couldn‚Äôt for the life of him seem to decide what to specialize in.¬† Hemming and hawing for a bit, he finally decided to just splurge and get a little bit of everything.¬† It would give him maximum versatility without over committing one way or another.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

It stands to reason that a proper Demon Lord should be able to bypass divine protections, and might be resistant to magic, so it is probably best to fortify one‚Äôs body and boost the crap out of one‚Äôs stats.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\] \[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Not really looking forward to having to do the whole baby with the mind of an adult trope.¬† He decides to just spawn in with his body already at its apex.¬† He never really understood why the grown ass adults in the shows and manga always seemed to end up as some kid.¬† Like yeah, wish fulfillment for young readers/watchers, but a guy in his twenties is going to wipe the floor with some punk ass sixteen-year-old.¬† Whatever, it didn‚Äôt really matter; to each their own he guessed.¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†

\[click\]¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Jason looked at his credit balance; it was painfully low, but he shrugged it off.¬† All he needed to do was complete the mission to get it back to a respectable level.¬† He looked at the payout for completing the mission.¬† It wasn‚Äôt impressive, Isekai almost never paid more than a pittance, but it should be enough to tide him over once he‚Äôd had his fun and squeezed every drop of wish fulfillment out of whatever backwater world, he ended up in.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

Jason‚Äôs attention was pulled from the status screen by the sound of a large \*CLUNK\*.¬† Looking over he saw that Ruby had apparently finally grown bored with her one-sided conversation.¬† To combat this boredom, she had pulled out an entire mothering fucking hogshead of whiskey.¬† From her pocket dimension, she pulls out two crystal glasses and fills both glasses with a hefty amount of liquor.¬† She sets one down in front of herself and puts the other one in front of Jason.¬†¬†

¬†¬†

‚ÄúDrink‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†¬†

‚ÄúThanks, but no thanks, I‚Äôm not inclined to degr....‚Äù¬†¬†

¬†¬†

‚ÄúI said, DRINK!‚Äù Ruby says again, her eyes filled with rage.¬† Her words reinforced with magical power, compel Jason to take a large gulp of the auburn liquid.¬† He‚Äôs amazed at the rich flavor of the whiskey.¬† The rich honey notes give the drink a sublime sweetness, without overshadowing the subtle dried red fruit.¬† The decades of barrel aging have left the drink smoother than silk.¬† The vague hints of oak and cinnamon leave him wanting more.¬† Time seems to melt away as he is compelled to have ‚Äòjust another sip‚Äô... ‚ÄòMaybe just a finger‚Äôs worth more‚Äô... ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs one more drink for the road?‚Äô.¬† The world around him seeps away, as he is lost in the complex rich flavors of Ruby‚Äôs private stash.¬†¬†¬†¬†

¬†¬†

When he next wakes, he‚Äôs once more found himself in the Void.¬†¬†¬†

¬†

684,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeneathDarkStars/comments/1cq7q7x/cassilda_or_camilla/,Cassilda or Camilla?,"It is hard for us, standing on this shore of Hali and peering across the cloudy waves towards Ythil, to fully understand the dynamics between the two sisters, or their apparent unceasing conflict. This conflict at times seems playful, at others deadly serious. A mirror for it may perhaps be found in the petty squables with serious ramifications of the court of the sun king; indeed, the Duc D'Orleans' femininity and love of pomp and ceremony clearly marks him as an adherent of Camilla. A deeper analysis of how the conflict between the two sisters, notably in the affair of the poisons, belongs in a separate post - but reveals much in terms of how his daughter's ambitions helped the yellow King spread the tendrils of his influence.

What I would like to discuss today then, is instead what we may divine of the nature of these two sisters. What follows is merely my intuition based on the stories and texts that I have found. What would I not give to have an in-person audience with one of our principal characters - although even the merest thought of such a prospect sends shivers of expectation, desire and fear in equal measure down my spine. But instead, to allow us to place in context this conflict that has driven so much of the secret history of our times, let me consider each sister in turn.

Cassilda is the sensuous sister. Her name speaks of faith in constant battle; thus revealing the duality of temptations that live within all of us. The saint that is named for her showed compassion to the Christian captives of her father; we should not hesitate in interpreting exactly what kind of nourishing bread she was carrying under her skirt. Some claim to have been told that Cassilda is in fact the Queen of Yhtil, and the progenitor of the royal line. If so, this would sugget that the future of the royal house of Uoht and Thale lies with her. Given what we know about the methods that she employs (to return to my tangent, consider the Madame de Montespan), we can surmise that a court of the pallid king where Cassilda's influence reigns unchecked would be one where rules and customs were subservient to entropy and anarchy, where every red dawn brings new possibilities.

Camilla is the purer sister. Although one should not conflate this with any particular moral-religious system. She is an acolyte to the ceremonies and systems of Aldebaran. Again, put to one side the rigid orders of the systems that you adhere to, think instead of the cloudy tides of Hali, obeying the disparate pull of the moons of the Hyades. Her less enlightened followers rigidly follow one set of invocations, one reading of the tarot, one economic system. But that misses the point. Camilla does not care what the system is, as long we follow it. Pure obedience and discipline are the hallmarks of the green duchess - but a court where Camilla's influence reigns would be no less chaotic and undpredictable than that of her sister.

So which sister should we favour? Do we wish to live beneath Hastur or Hali? And where sits the Last King in all of this? It is hard for us to discern the hand on the tiller from our precise moment. Sometimes I wonder if we are receiving dispatches from a war that is taking place across the discordant realities of the multiverse, and that what we are living is merely the fever dream of an old king regretting passing the keys of his kingdom to his daughters before time. Other times, it appears more that we are mere playthings of a noble house who care for us as little as they care for the flies whose wings they idly sever as they jest and laugh amongst themselves. This gordian knot might yet be detangled through the contents of that terrible second act, if we are able to find it.",12 May 2024 09:20:17,reddit

687,https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/comments/1cq5kso/what_are_some_of_the_notable_or_coolest_laserdisc/,What are some of the notable or coolest laserdisc releases you own?,"Bold Font isn't working anymore so this is going to look kind of ugly. Okay I don't know what's going on with the Font on Reddit but it works sometimes but other times it won't let me use it. This is bizarre.

**Antz 1998** [ID5915DW](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08665/ID5915DW/Antz)  **Released:** 10/08/1999

# At First Sight 1999 [ML107181](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08645/ML107181/At-First-Sight) Released: 27/04/1999 Notable for it's late release. Wouldn't called it coolest.

# Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery: Special Edition 1997 [ID3965LI](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/07988/ID3965LI/Austin-Powers:-International-Man-of-Mystery:-Special-Edition)  Notable because of the bright colors It's a common enough laserdisc for the standard surround sound version.

# Blade 1998  [ID4252LI](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08565/ID4252LI/Blade) Released: 22/12/1999

**Bride of Chucky 1998** [LD 83749-WS](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/22022/LD-83749-WS/Bride-of-Chucky) **Released:** 30/03/1999 \*My favorite Widescreen release. Looks fantastic but this is not a cheap laserdisc and ranges from 120-170 or higher on Ebay at the time of this posting. So can't really recommend to anyone that is struggling financially.

**Child's Play 2** **1990** [41024](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/03292/41024/Childs-Play-2)  Notable because of it's incredibly beautiful Cav side for the last 20 mins or so of the movie. Looks really gorgeous and if you do a quick google search you can find screen captures I did with Hauppauge with my CLD-99. The CLV side is no slouch either. It's all around one of the best looking 4:3 releases on this format. You'll specifically be able to notice the detail and the beautiful eyes on the CAV side. They stand out even more so especially with close up shots of Chucky and Andy. I notice on lddb some copies might have light rot from what has been reported. I did not notice rot on my copy. I notice black noise at the beginning but that's from the film print and normal.

**Cliffhanger** **1993** [78806](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/07614/78806/Cliffhanger) I remember this being a pretty good looking Widescreen release. It's also cheap to comeby and I recommend it. It's a very common laserdisc. Common isn't bad though especially if the release looks good video quality wise. Actually as collectors and movie lovers I think we all would prefer if this format was more common so things would be more affordable.

**The Crush 1993** [12926](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/09122/12926/Crush-The) This version of the film is notable for having the correct name Darian. I actually took the laserdisc audio and spliced it into a bluray release of the film to have the correct name in the movie. You ask how can you do that when Laserdisc flips? Well, that's simple because the software I use allowed me to trim the audio so when it flipped it wasn't going to stay out of sync. Now I synced it up as best as I could and obviously it's hard to get anything perfect but I have streamed the movie in the past with others that didn't notice any audio out of sync issues so I think I did a pretty good job. I don't remember the picture quality on this one being on the level of Bride of Chucky or Cliffhanger. I think the bluray release of this did a good job picture quality wise. I'd only recommend this movie if you want the real name Darian. Also, for legal purposes I cannot give out a copy of my edit of the film for obvious reasons. I don't hold the copyrights.

**Dark Tide** **1993** [LDCVM5850](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/23676/LDCVM5850/Dark-Tide) This is the best looking release of this film and a laserdisc exclusive. Maybe in the future we will get a bluray release of it but I wouldn't hold my breath with the weird environment we live in. People get easily offended and a movie about Women being forced on an island is probably not a good selling point in this sensitive society. The main actress is beautiful though. She is really pretty. I don't know what she is but I could see her being a type of an Italian. She looks a bit italian to me. Maybe she is an Irish girl that just is good at tanning even though I've never really heard of a person who is Irish that can tan well. :)

**Demonic Toys 1992** [LV12937](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/25010/LV12937/Demonic-Toys) Full Moon typically has great looking releases on laserdisc. I know this because I own quite a few of them. This is no exception. This is basically a 4:3 dvd level laserdisc similar to that of Child's Play 2. I don't think this has a CAV side but either way I remember the picture quality on this looking gorgeous even on a big flat screen. I should test it out on my crt TV which I'm sure will look even better.

**Dollman Vs. Demonic Toys** **1993** [LV83102](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/23647/LV83102/Dollman-Vs.-Demonic-Toys) See above it has great video quality for 4:3 aspect ratio. The biggest crime with this movie is that a large portion is a recap of Dollman and Demonic Toys movie before the actual real short movie starts. I first seen this movie back in the 90s as a kid when it was shown on Sci-Fi channel.

**Ernest Saves Christmas 1988** [953 AS](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/00839/953-AS/Ernest-Saves-Christmas) Again another great 4:3 aspect ratio movie. I own all the Ernest movies on laserdisc but I found that the Christmas and Halloween movies were the only ones with really good picture quality. The other two not so much and **Ernest Goes To Camp is incredibly rare** and I'm lucky even have that one in my collection. I believe the Christmas one shows up every so often on Ebay and the Halloween one is kind of rare but not on the level of Ernest Goes to Camp. Ernest Goes to Prison seems to be the most common one of them all when it comes to laserdisc, then Ernest Saves Christmas, Ernest Scared Stupid, and then in my opinion the hardest to come by is Ernest Goes to Camp.

**Ernest Scared Stupid** **1991** [1305 AS](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/26435/1305-AS/Ernest-Scared-Stupid) This is one of the best looking laserdisc releases for 4:3. It's up there with Child's Play 2 and Demonic Toys. I'd rate it slightly above Ernest Saves Christmas in video quality and Ernest Saves Christmas is a great release on it's own. I believe they may have used a different camera to film Ernest Scared Stupid but either way it's really clear looking and I have posted screens of this on reddit with a quick search and on lddb's screen shot topic.

**Friday the 13th films** all look good on laserdisc. Now could they have been a little better looking. Debatable because the cameras used and these are older films. I do remember being impressed by Friday the 13th part 5, 6, 7, and 8. Those 4 specifically look pretty good on laserdisc. Part 1 looks great but the aspect ratio is incorrect or looks weird from what I remember. I forget if the image is squished or stretched out. I think it might be slightly stretched out maybe to show more of a widescreen look at 4:3. I don't know but part 1 has weird aspect ratio from what my memory tells me. I own part 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 on laserdisc. I do actually own part 3 but I don't count it because it has laserdisc rot and is completely unwatchable. I think the part 2 I have has mild rot but is very watchable. Rotted laserdiscs I'm usually refunded for by sellers on lddb and ebay. People are usually kind to others and maybe they didn't get around to testing it or what not who knows. Well, ebay sellers typically don't a have a player but a good amount of lddb sellers do and the ebay sellers that usually do have players to test on would be people that probably sell on lddb.

**Night Life** **1989** [90196](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/02761/90196/Night-Life) Stuck on laserdisc and the video quality is meh. It's definitely  alot better than vhs if I had to guess but I don't remember being overly impressed. It's not terrible by any means but I think I was expecting a little more. Also, this is a movie title I'm shocked hasn't been release on bluray yet. Not sure if they believe it's not good enough for them to make $$$ on it or what. It's definitely something I thought Arrow Video, Scream/Shout Factory, Vinegar Syndrome, or one of those labels would have been able to obtain. I believe RCA owns this and I don't know if RCA is still the same RCA or if they were bought out. lddb tells me RCA and Columbia Pictures owns this movie. Keep in mind we have no idea what the original film print is like. Maybe it's too badly damage and this might be stuck on laserdisc.

**Nightflyers** **1987** [LD 65169](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/22204/LD-65169/Nightflyers) Another Stuck on laserdisc and I also don't know why. The video quality again is meh and more of the middle of the road. Keep in mind I'm comparing video quality to stuff like Child's Play 2, Ernest Scared Stupid, Ernest Saves Christmas, Demonic Toys, and Full moon movies. When I say meh or middle of the road I'm not crucifying the release because they are still light years better than the VHS counterparts if I had to guess. It's still the best and only way to see the films until they get a possible bluray release. Again, I have no idea if some of these film prints are damaged to the point the laserdisc releases might be the best it ever looks. Only time will tell if they release in high definition.

**A Nightmare on Elm Street films** I own all 6 on film and the widescreen releases are pretty good for the format. I own the first 3 films in widescreen and the 4th, 5th, and 6th all look pretty good at their 4:3 aspect ratio. If memory serves me correctly I believe the 4th and 5th film specifically look pretty good at 4:3. The 5th film The Dream Child is only Uncut on laserdisc and vhs. I do not know why it never got a bluray or higher definition release. Maybe the uncut film print was damaged? I don't know but I do know someone was working on a project to restore it probably from a laserdisc print or I don't know what they were doing but they may have stopped because maybe New Line or someone sent them a cease and desist letter which sucks. His work can be found on youtube of the extended scenes.

**Odyssey, The** [ID3629HL](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/07868/ID3629HL/Odyssey-The) This release is great looking and definitely comparable or up there with the dvd release. Might even beat the dvd release if the dvd release has any bitrate issues. I remember watching this at school in one of my study hall classes or maybe it was a real class. I forget but I believe the guy brought it in on either vhs or dvd back in the early 2000s and we watched it on a crt tv. Actually, I'm pretty certain it was his vhs copy of the movie. Anyways the laserdisc release of this is gorgeous. I'd rate it up there with Child's Play 2, Ernest Scared Stupid, and Demonic Toys.

**Pinocchio's Revenge** [LDVM5909](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/37300/LDVM5909/Pinocchios-Revenge) This is a fantastic release and up there with Child's Play 2 and the other movies I mentioned. I would love to say it's dvd level but the Dvd of this actually beats this by a hair. I've compared it to the DVD through screens in the past and comparing a DVD copy to it and the DVD wins. Doesn't Win by a lot and you can probably be fooled if someone hides their laserdisc player and you would probably assume it's DVD. However side by side the DVD has a little bit more details in the dolls eyes and so on. However, this is not me downplaying this laserdisc which I paid a for in the past and I see it goes up and down on ebay often so I don't think it's a super uncommon laserdisc but it's definitely one of the better 4:3 video quality films and I think Pioneerdid a fantastic job with this release. [https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/comments/vrvsif/what\_is\_the\_best\_looking\_laserdisc\_video\_quality/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/comments/vrvsif/what_is_the_best_looking_laserdisc_video_quality/)

**Small Soldiers** [ID5914DW](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/08685/ID5914DW/Small-Soldiers) **Released:** 31/08/1999    This like Ants rarely shows up for the North American release on Ebay. I'm guessing it's either uncommon since they are both late releases or people tossed their copies out in the trash for whatever reason. Maybe they viewed this format obsolete. Funny thing is the first dvd release of Small Soldier was not good and I think it may have actually took it from the laserdisc version which is pretty good widescreen for a laserdisc. I like having this one in my collection and the video quality is solid. [https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/comments/10x89aa/small\_soldiers\_laserdisc\_vs\_bluray/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LaserDisc/comments/10x89aa/small_soldiers_laserdisc_vs_bluray/)

**Stranded** **1987** [32771](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/00639/32771/Stranded) Another movie I'm shocked never got a dvd or bluray release. This one has Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers in it. Is it a great film? No but I wouldn't call it terrible. More like middle of the road film. I think the biggest thing the film has going in it is that Flea is one of the Aliens. Video quality also meh middle of the road probably better than the VHS by a long shot. Maybe if I run into Flea I'll have him sign this one day but I doubt that'll ever happen. I don't go to conventions. I can see why this movie doesn't have a bluray release because I don't know how many people would want one. It's such an obscure piece of History. I'm not picky when it comes to movies so I think this movie is pretty cool but I can see others not liking it or giving it a chance.

**Summer Camp Nightmare** **1987** [75666](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/23331/75666/Summer-Camp-Nightmare) Very weird revenge movie at a camp. I don't want to spoil to much but this one is so crazy that I do recommend people watching it. If you can't get it on laserdisc or if you think it's too expensive. I don't even know what it sells for now and I doubt I paid a lot for it maybe in the $20-$30 range 4-5 years ago or so if I had to guess in the past. But this is a fun movie in my opinion. Just bat shit crazy and that's kind of how I like it. Video quality is meh another Middle in the Road Video quality wise but I'd have to take an educated guess and say it probably beats the VHS.

**Wild Wild West** **1999** [17794](https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/09274/17794/Wild-Wild-West) So So movie average from what most say. However, the video quality on this release is great for a widescreen release. Its up there with the better widescreen releases. However this is one of the laserdiscs that usually command a decent price. It's not in the hundreds range normally but usually commands between 60-80 dollars. Will Smith is also a douche in real life and I think many of us are pretty much done watching his movies. He is controlled by his sick Wife. He is the ultimate Femboy. I'd get Kevin Kline and Salma Hayek but definitely don't care for Will Smith's signature. I actually think with his behavior in recent History and even his weird racial movie choices by pushing for division between people with the Emancipation movie. I think people have just had enough of Will Smith. Most normal people do not want to hear the cries of the past and the injustice of people. It is not only a certain demographic that had to go through cruel times but with the way Hollywood works they push movies like this to divide and conquer. Also, most of our Ancestors did not own black slaves because I believe it was mostly rich White people which the Majority of the Americans are not and are not descendants of rich people. Yet they lump us in with those people and blame us all for what happened to a certain demographic when most of our Ancestors probably weren't even living in USA. On my Fathers side they did come over here and they fought for the Union Army but that's besides the point. I don't like how people are keeping slavery alive in the minds of people and pushing victimhood. I don't think it's good for black people or anyone.",12 May 2024 07:17:09,reddit

If I had a nickel for every time LSS released a female stealth based hero that ended up being strictly better than my favorite hero in the game, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.

We are currently right in the midst of the highs and lows of MST spoiler season. We have every single Assassin and Mystic Assassin card fully revealed. One thing has become painfully obvious. Nuu is now the second hero in a growing list of heroes that just takes everything Arakni does, and does it better.

Now, there could be a very long discussion here about the why of this. I could probably write a whole post about it. Maybe I will. But that's not what this is about. This is something else.

So. You want to play Arakni, and you, along with everyone else who made this journey before you, have come to the startling realization that maybe Nuu might just be the better route. This is the guide for you. This is not a beginners guide to Nuu. This is not a deep dive into everything Nuu is capable of. This is one thing: A guide to take what you know in Arakni and adapt it into what you know in Nuu.

For that reason, I'm going to assume you already know how Arakni works and understand how Arakni is played. If you do not, I have linked part 1 above. The previous post was obviously not intended to be a part 1. It is now though.



# The Baseline

If we remove Arakni from the deck, we lose exactly three things.

Firstly, we lose Regicide. To quote the ex wife of a dead husband I was trying to reach when I cold called her in my sales job after telling her I was sorry for her loss, ""It's not a loss.""

Secondly, we lose Coercive Tendencies. CT does a few very strong things, all of which are very unfortunate. It is guaranteed to grab a card from the deck and can give go again on a hit to the whole chain. It is a strong power turn, and it will be missed. Not too much, for eventually obvious reasons.

Thirdly, we lose the Arakni hero ability. This is probably the biggest hit, as there is no direct analogue to be found in Nuu. We unfortunately just lose it, and can't do anything about it. This means Nuu inherently makes less silver and has less direct deck disruption. We can't just turn off pitch stacks anymore.

So what do we gain from this transaction? A lot.

Let's start with the bare minimum. It's called Intimate Inducement. As of the writing of this post, we currently don't know how or even if it scales. We know it's a common, and we know the blue version. This is the raw text of that blue card:

0 cost 3 block blue pitch Mystic Assassin Attack Reaction. Target Assassin or Mystic attack action card gets +1 power. Look at the top 2 cards of the defending hero's deck and choose a card. If it's blue, it has 0 base defense. Put the chosen card onto the active chain link as a defending card and the rest on top in any order.

The current theories on scaling include: More power, dig deeper, different colors for the 0 base defense. Personally, I think power is guaranteed, color is likely, and digging deeper is not going to happen.

Again, as this is the bare minimum, I am going to ""accidentally"" forget to mention literally every single card spoiled outside of Intimate Inducement. A quick rules note: When you look at the top two cards and choose a card, you put it on the chain. You do not have to choose a blue card to put it on the chain. If you do choose a blue card, that card has 0 block. If you don't choose a blue card, that card still has a block value. Regardless of the situation, you are always allowed to put a card on the chain regardless of the color of said card.

Let's compare this card to CT. CT digs 3 deep and banishes a card. This digs 2 deep and puts a card onto the chain link defending. It doesn't banish, but the end result is the same: A card is removed from the deck with no cost.

Now, Coercive gives go again and can create silver. Intimate gives power. Technically, there are more use cases where Coercive is stronger than Intimate. That said, you can only run 3 Coercive. You can run 9 Intimates.

Are we better than Arakni now with this simple swap? Yes. On paper, no. Coercive is stronger. Arakni can ""fateseal"". Except this is a fatigue deck, and your opponent now starts with 6 less cards. I don't really know what else to say to convince you that this is better. Intimate is better than Coercive, and it hurts me to write that out.

Now, some of you will disagree with me. And that's fine. In fact, I won't even argue with you. Arakni hero ability + Coercive Tendencies is quite strong, and in all honesty, probably better than no hero ability and 9 copies of Intimate. But that's the thing. Remember how I said I was ignoring every other card? This is the baseline, with a single card. What if we started adding everything else in as well?



# More Reactions

Tide Chakra is the worst card I'm about to talk about. So we'll mention it first. This is very simple: It's a 1 for +3 that can target any and every Assassin attack. Sometimes it gets +5. This is already good in your original Arakni shell. Turns out, a 1 for +3 attack reaction is strong. I don't need to tell you that, you're already running 3 Cut to the Chase. Another one at a higher cost is desired.

But now, if you've pitched a blue, say, to dagger, what if you could do more? Hiss and Venomous Bite also exist. With a blue in your pitch zone, those two create additional attack reactions that can target anything and give go again and +1 respectively. So basically, with a blue pitch, you now have a 1 for +3 go again and a 1 for +4. The additional card can also be arsenaled for later, used on later chain links, or just played immediately. Regardless, they're both fantastic.

Some currently are becoming of the opinion that Hiss is a trap. I'm inclined to agree with them, but it's early enough in testing that I will keep an open mind. Regardless, both of these cards are options, and a VBite will never be a bad move.

Lastly, you get Gorgon's Gaze and Siren's call. I don't personally care for either of these very much. Gorgon's is a super niche yellow that fills the same role as Spreading Plague. Siren's Call is interesting to me, and I don't know how much I like it. It's also a sideboard card, but the lack of increased power is not something I'm too fond of.

You don't have to play all of these cards. I won't, personally. But imagine playing your Arakni deck with more reactions to push your contracts. That's not a hard sell, it's really good. We're not done though, because Nuu is still blank.



# Chi

We have two outlets for Chi in Nuu. Nuu's hero ability and Mask of Recurring Nightmares. We also have 8 cards available with the text ""Transcend.""

7 of the 8 Transcend cards are basic. Do a simple thing, transform into a Chi if you've played another blue. There are only a few worth mentioning beyond that fact. Pass Over allows you to banish any card in the opponents graveyard. This will probably create you a silver when played at the right time and can also just accidentally turn Fai off. Path Well Traveled gives go again to literally anything. I don't think I need to tell you why go again is good. If I need to though, imagine just playing out Surgical into Leave No Witnesses and not having to worry about hitting for Blacktek. It's kinda good.

1 of the 8 Transcend cards is maybe the strongest card I haven't mentioned yet, and rivals even the cards I have. Sacred Art: Undercurrent Desires is really good. For a higher cost, you get to play Pass Over twice by banishing two cards from grave. Hopefully this makes you some silver. You also get to create a Fang Strike (the +1 power mentioned from VBite) and a Slither (the go again mentioned from hiss) in hand. Remember, these can target anything. At a baseline though, it's just +1 and go again. Which remember, is still really good. You could probably spend hours talking about optimal lines with this card, which I could do, but I won't right now. The key takeaway is that the longer you look at Undercurrent, the more broken it is.

Now, what can you put the Chi into? Again, that would be Nuu's hero ability and Mask of Recurring Nightmares. Mask is a free banish. It doesn't create any silver, but it still eats a card. This is amazing. No matter what else I say, remember that Chi can just turn into free banishes regardless. Nuu's hero ability can do more.

So, you're playing your Arakni deck. You're banishing some cards and creating some silver. This is all very good. Now what if, at the cost of a single card in your deck, you could now play those cards you are banishing. It might just be the blues, but you can still play them. Sweet, you can do that.

In a fatigue gameplan, thanks to Chi, you are now playing your opponents cards instead of your own. You are winning the card economy in the end game. Easily. But, if you can't play the cards, at the very least you get to force them to discard.

You don't have to play Mask or all 8 transcend cards. You probably shouldn't do that last part. I won't judge if you do, though. Technically, you only really need one to be able to take advantage of the huge strength found in the fatigue end game. And that's the whole point. Take your Arakni deck, add one Chi, and you win in fatigue. Add a few more and Mask, and now you can disrupt from the hand for free.



# Stealth

Arakni can't run stealth cards. I mean, they can. But they shouldn't (most of the time). One primary reason was simple: Cut to the Chase can't target them and you don't get to fateseal off of them. Well, now, you don't have a fateseal, and you have enough reactions where losing Cut to the Chase isn't such a big deal. So we can start looking at those stealth cards a little more seriously.

The Outsiders stealth cards exist, and are good, but we're mostly going to ignore them. Honorable mention for Infiltrate as more playable banishes, Malign as ward hate, and Infect because Bloodrot is pretty good.

The Mistveil stealth cards are all super varied, but you can pretty easily describe a good chunk of them. On hit, banish the top card of the opponents deck (and sometimes a card in their graveyard). When you banish a specific card type, gain 1 life. Also, whenever the opponent blocks with an action card, it gets banished when the chain link closes and that can sometimes gain you life as well. Thanks Nuu.

When looking at just these cards, they are effectively contract cards without the contract keyword. They have -1 power and gain life instead of silver. There are tradeoffs for both of those and frankly, I don't know which is better.

You also get Double Trouble, which loses the life gain for the ability to banish two from deck when two or more attack reactions are played in the chain (Hiss and VBite fulfill both reactions)

Also, you get Art of Desire, which takes that lifegain and also gives you card draw when you banish a specific type.

Also you get Bonds of Agony and Persuasive Prognosis, which are both insane. I cannot state this enough: those two cards are bonkers. Fun fact, they are game changing. Agony requires 3 reactions, but gives you +3 power (A blue stealth at a red contract rate) and allows you to banish a card in hand and 2 more of the same card in deck or graveyard. You get 3 in total. This is Surgical Extraction copies 4, 5, and 6. But it also is better. It's a high cost, but it is worth that cost. This one probably isn't playable in Arakni. Persuasive is just the regular rate of a blue stealth, but now it creates life from any action card and banishes both top and a card from hand. It's also just really good. This one is playable in Arakni.

In Arakni, you can only run contract. By moving to Nuu, you can now run stealth. You don't have to run stealth, a contract list is probably very good. But you can run stealth, and there are a lot of bonuses for it.

There are probably three main shells here: Contract with Persuasive and Agony, stealth with Leave No Witnesses and Surgical, or those four mentioned cards plus a few other weaker stealth or contract cards like Art of Desire or Annihilate the Armed. Basically, you can be heavily invested in contract, heavily invested in stealth, or a mix of both. Or really anywhere in between, it's your choice.

I don't know which of those three shells is best. I don't know if one of those three shells is better than the others. Maybe one is, maybe we'll figure out which in time. There are strengths to all three. There are weaknesses to all three. As of right now, it really is just wide open for which you want to do.



# In Conclusion

If you like Arakni and have been playing Arakni, you were already making a bad decision. Contract Uzuri was previously strictly better. That said, it was only a little bit better, Arakni was still very good. This means a very large portion of the Assassin playerbase were still playing Arakni out of passion.

If you would like to remain on Arakni out of passion moving forward, I wish you the best. I wish I could justify it myself, but unfortunately, the power difference between Arakni and Nuu is just substantially larger than the difference between Arakni and contract Uzuri. So much larger that I personally can't justify the handicap in the name of passion.

All you technically have to do is take Arakni and replace CT and a few other cards with Intimate. It doesn't take too much fiddling with other reactions, chi, and a few stealth cards to take that baseline and dial it to 11 though.

The fun part is that if you're reading this now, it means you can jump in on the ground floor of Nuu. You have the experience from Arakni, and can play the same deck but with all of the options I just spent the past post mentioning. And the spoilers for Nuu were literally just finished a few hours ago. And we still haven't even seen all the classless Mystic cards yet. There could be even more gems in there. Hop in the discord, get some theory crafting going, and start jamming some Nuu. Just, don't turn into Archon Alters. Don't spend 48 hours in the past day theorycrafting this deck. Take some time and get some rest in between deckbuilds.

I look forward to this journey with Nuu moving forward. I don't look at Arakni with sorrow that I'm moving on, but happiness that they got us to where we are today. Hopefully, I can return to Arakni in the future, with a viable deck outside of Nuu and Uzuri's shadow. Hopefully, in that day, it's not even a handicap to do so. It's okay if it isn't tomorrow though, or the next day. I think I can spend a bit of time getting to know Nuu. I'm excited for what she holds.",11 May 2024 20:30:29,reddit

699,https://www.reddit.com/r/octopathtraveler/comments/1cpu0eb/octopath_2_with_only_elemental_damage_log_day_16/,Octopath 2 with only Elemental damage Log: Day 16,"# Day 16: Dawning upon me

Ok, time for some final preparations. I decided the easiest one was to get ochette‚Äôs beasts. The first and most important one is the dark manta. This one is on the sea. It deals AOE dark damage and increases elemental attack. That‚Äôs very useful to help buff my party.¬†

Anyways, I equipped more rare monster, along with evil ward on Osvald, and searched for it at night. After around 10 encounters, I got into an encounter with one.¬†

I used Empoison with hikari and used provoke beasts with ochette to break with mahina. I used donate BP with Partitio on ochette and analyze with Osvald to check its HP (which was 5030).¬†

Next turn, Partitio used darkest night without boosts to deal 1000 damage, Ochette used provoke beasts with mahina but it didn‚Äôt break because one of them didn‚Äôt hit a weakness, so hikari had to come in with elemental bomb to break it. It‚Äôs now at yellow HP, so I should be able to get it next turn.¬†

I defend with everyone except ochette and then fully boost with capture and it was a 100% chance so I got it, replacing it with my old assassin bug. That thing was the first monster I caught but I literally never used it because I remembered beastly howl.¬†

Anyways, now it‚Äôs time to go cait hunting. First I travelled back to tropuhapu to break into someone‚Äôs house with hikari and obtain some cait powder.¬†

I then got the other cait powder by fast travelling to clockbank and doing the ‚Äúmy beloved Catherine‚Äù side quest, which was quite easy as all I needed to do was befriend the quest giver with ochette and go to the next screen.¬†

I equipped both cait powders on Osvald, gave him evil ward and gave ochette more rare monsters. I then fast travelled over to crackridge and began looking for caits at night.¬†

I did also get negotiate schedule on Partitio while looking for caits as it was taking awhile. It‚Äôs his first ex skill and I don‚Äôt know why I put it off for so long. It effectively gives him an extra turn and deletes the enemy‚Äôs turn for leaves, which we have plenty of.¬†

Ok, uh, literally right after I got negotiate schedule I found the cait. I used darkest night with Partitio for 20 damage‚Ä¶ and the kill. Come on! Ok, lesson learned, don‚Äôt damage it with Partitio.¬†

Ok, it‚Äôs been about 30 encounters now with no caits. I decided to head back to the shrine to see if that somehow helps with my cait encounter rate.¬†

Ok, after about 5 more encounters, I got one. Partitio fully boosts with his latent power to use negotiate schedule on the cait. Hikari uses lightning falls on the cait for 24 damage and the kill. Crap! Ok, I‚Äôm unequipping their elemental equipment.¬†

Ok, it didn‚Äôt take too long to encounter another cait. Hikari uses lightning falls for 7 damage, knocking it to red health. Partitio then uses donate BP on ochette with 1 boost and Ochette fully boosts with capture at a 100% chance to get the cultured cait. I replace it with the treant and beat the rest of the monsters up.¬†

That was a lot harder than I expected. I probably should have unequipped the elemental equipment earlier. Anyways, next up on my list is for hikari to get the learned skill vacant stare. It‚Äôs from an elderly lady in crackridge funnily enough, and it was very easy with compound formulae due to her low level. Vacant stare lowers elemental defence, so in a way it‚Äôs a more reliable beastly howl.¬†

Anyways, I decided it was finally time for the conjurerer. The conjurerer has very useful skills and is a good job for Ochette as it gives the highest HP boost, in addition to a staff. It‚Äôs in Ku and I have to beat 5 bosses to get it. Luckily it isn‚Äôt consecutive, so I can actually fast travel and rest to restore my latent power.¬†

I‚Äôm going into the tower with cleric thron√©, arcanist Osvald, armsmassti, and inventor hikari. Let‚Äôs do this.¬†

The first trial was against Gken (that‚Äôs not a typo, that‚Äôs his really name). Castti was up first and used icicle for 3337 damage, hikari was next and used compound formulae for 3300 damage. Thron√© then used veil of darkness for 1845 damage and Osvald used elemental barrage for around 3000 damage.¬†

Thron√© used veil of darkness again as Gken used fluid stance‚Ä¶ which set up 5 reflects. Uh oh. Hikari used Empoison and Castti concocted a forget me do and a weed, removing the reflects and lowering his elemental attack. Osvald used analyze, revealing he has 16667 HP but no elemental weaknesses.¬†

Hikari then fully boosted with vacant stare to lower his elemental defence for 4 turns. Gken used purple lightning which dealt 1000 damage and caused everyone except Castti to be knocked unconscious. What the heck? I thought this guy was easy. Castti then fully boosted with her latent power using a grape leaf, a cleansing leaf, a pomegranate leaf, a diffusing serum and a strengthen serum to heal and remove ailments.¬†

Next turn, hikari used compound formulae at 2 boost for around 9200 damage. Gken then used cleave in 2 which hit and dealt some damage to hikari. Gken is now at red health, so thron√© fully boosted with darkest night for win with 14000 damage.¬†

Onto trial 2 with the snake charmer, ichchadhari. Hikari was up first and used compound formulae for around 2800 damage but no shields. Thron√© used veil of darkness for 1651 damage and Castti uses icicle for 3106 damage. Osvald then used elemental barrage for around 3400 damage and knocked off 2 shields. It seems like it‚Äôs only weak to lightning.¬†

The snake charmer then summoned her snake and locked her weaknesses, While missing a paralyzing fang on thron√©. Hikari used compound formulae for around 3000 damage, knocking a shield off the snake. Thron√© then used luminescence for around 1500 damage, knocking off a shield from the snake. Castti defended for later and Osvald used the one true magic 2 for 4600 damage and broke the snake.¬†

Next turn, Castti fully boosted, using a plum leaf, a whimsical leaf, a pomegranate leaf, a diffusing serum and a strengthen serum to bring everyone up. Hikari then fully boosted with compound formulae for 10400 and killing the snake. Thron√© then used her latent power, using a fully boosted veil of darkness on the first for 6705 damage and the second with a 2 boost veil of darkness for 4900 damage. Osvald then fully boosted with his latent power, using the one true magic 2 for around 42000 damage and the win.¬†

Ok, trial 3 with Tyran the seeker. Thron√© is up first and uses veil of darkness for 2177 damage and knocks off a shield. Hikari uses compound formulae for around 3400 damage and knocks off 2 shields. Osvald uses fire storm for 4000 damage and knocks off 2 shields, as Castti uses 2 darkdelions to knock off 2 shields for around 2500 damage.¬†

Castti then uses another 2 darkdelions to break Tyran for around 3000 damage this time. Thron√© uses a plum basket to get everyone‚Äôs SP up, hikari uses critical scope for extra damage, and Osvald uses advanced magic on thron√©.¬†

Next turn, Osvald fully boosts with his latent power using the one true magic 2 for 105000 damage and the win. To put that into perspective, that‚Äôs half of Vide‚Äôs phase one health. So yeah, that‚Äôs a lot.¬†

Anyways, trial 4 is with Au√∞nvarg (I‚Äôll call him Aardvark because that‚Äôs easier to spell). Anyways, thron√© is up first and uses veil of darkness for 1699 damage and his skull roller is killed. Osvald uses elemental barrage for around 3000 damage and knocks off 2 shields. Castti the concocts 2 lilies of light dealing around 2500 damage and knocking off 2 shields. Hikari then 1 boosts with elemental bomb, as I know I won‚Äôt break it before it acts if I don‚Äôt do it, to knock off 4 shields for around 2000 damage.¬†

Thron√© then uses holy light for 2355 damage and the break on aardvark. Osvald then uses advanced magic on thron√©, just in case. Castti then uses icicle for 6153 damage and hikari uses critical scope.¬†

Next turn, thron√© fully boosts with radiance for around 19000 damage. Hikari then uses vacent stare on aardvark to lower elemental defence, just so that I can see how much damage Osvald can do. Castti then uses icicle at full boost for 46600 damage, knocking it to red health. Osvald then fully boosts with his latent power, but unfortunately he‚Äôs too low on SP for the one true magic so he instead uses benediction for around 94000 damage and the kill on aardvark. Just imagine that with the one true magic. I get the feeling it‚Äôd do max damage.¬†

Ok, final trial with priestess Hinoekargura. Osvald uses resentment to knock off 2 shields and deal 3600 damage. Thron√© uses veil of darkness for 2130 damage and another shield off. Hikari uses compound formulae for around 3000 damage and a shield off. Castti then uses 2 dark delions for 2400 damage and knocks off 2 shields.¬†

Thron√© then uses darkest night for 2762 damage and the break. Osvald uses a medium plum on himself for some SP, hikari uses critical scope, and Castti uses icicle for 7405 damage.¬†

Next turn, Osvald fully boosts with his latent power, using the one true magic for around 105000 damage, knocking her to yellow health. Thron√© then uses her latent power, fully boosting a darkest night for 21300 damage and using a veil of darkness for 4025 damage. Hikari then fully boosts with compound formulae for around 29000 damage. Castti then uses her latent power, using 4 bluster blooms and a strengthening serum for‚Ä¶ 4 damage? What?¬†

Hinoekargura uses conjure flames then attacks hikari for around 1300 fire damage. She then changes to her demon form. Osvald then uses elemental barrage for around 2500 damage, thron√© uses holy light for 2892 and a shield. Castti then uses 2 lilies of light for‚Ä¶ 2 damage? What the heck is happening?! She has insane elemental attack. Hikari then uses empoison in hopes it somehow kills her.¬†

Hinoekargura ends up killing everyone with a fiery dance. What the heck happened to castti‚Äôs concocts? She was dealing good damage in the previous fights and it‚Äôs not like the priestess has high elemental defence. Ok, let‚Äôs go in again for round 2.¬†

First up for round 2 is thron√©, who uses darkest night for 2762 damage and a shield off. Osvald uses blizzard for 4000 damage and 2 shields off. Hikari then uses critical scope and Castti uses 2 darkdelions for 2 damage.¬†

Thron√© uses her latent power, using darkest night twice for the break and around 7000 damage. Osvald then uses a medium plum on himself, castti uses icicle for 7400 damage and hikari uses vacant stare at 1 boost to lower her elemental defence for 2 turns.¬†

Next turn, hikari one boosts with Empoison to set up poison for 4 turns, Osvald fully boosts with the one true magic 2 and his latent power for 15600 damage. Not max, but still a lot and it knocks her to red. Thron√© then fully boosts with darkest night for the win with 32000 damage.¬†

Ok, that was an interesting fight. I‚Äôm still curious why the concocts dealt such low damage to her. I hope that doesn‚Äôt cause any problems. Anyways, I equip ochette with the conjurerer job and give her the bellowing baton. This will make her thunderbird a bit more potent (if she ever uses it).¬†

I also get all of the conjurerer skills. This allows her to get SP saver (which is very useful for provoke beasts) and BP regeneration. This allows her to effectively spam provoke beasts. Thron√© unfortunately doesn‚Äôt have enough JP to get BP regeneration, so that‚Äôs a bit sad.¬†

Anyways, I think it‚Äôs time for some of hikari‚Äôs other learned skills. Turns out, Plukk is actually weaker than the shield thief guy at only 5 challenge. I was able to beat them easily. Not in one turn like the elderly lady but it was still very easy with compound formulae, lightning falls, and elemental bottle.¬†

This got me the learned skill ‚Äúlet‚Äôs end this‚Äù which I replaced with Hachimonjigiri, as it‚Äôs a sword skill and I can‚Äôt use it. Now all I have left in my preparations is shield thief and another monster. Shield thief is obviously very hard so I need a lot of jams.¬†

I fast travelled back to cropdale and fought a villager with ochette. The specific villager I fought can drop refreshing jams 20% of the time. Someone told me about her last playthrough and she was very useful. She‚Äôs also quite weak at only a challenge of 1.¬†

I fought her until I got 10 then went back to winterbloom to fight the shield thief guy. The first time I forgot the apothecary job. On the second attempt, I gave hikari the apothecary job along with alpione‚Äôs amulet and deal more damage in hopes of it turning the tides if things go south.¬†

With the second attempt, I was able to win with Empoison and weak to poison, along with 5 refreshing jams. The extra damage from alpione‚Äôs didn‚Äôt help but the extra HP definitely did help a lot. I ended up replacing vacant stare with shield thief, as critical scope did effectively the same thing but better.¬†

I also got SP saver on hikari, which will be extremely useful with shield thief and even compound formulae. With Melia‚Äôs amulet, hikari can effectively use his skills all day.¬†

Anyways, the final thing I need is the light sentinel Mk.2, which is in the shrine of ulsterra. This will help break Vide‚Äôs final phase, where I can use multishine to break vide almost immediately.¬†

The guard at the entrance was very easy and after several encounters I found it. Hikari used compound formulae which broke both the sentinels in the encounter. Agnea used elemental barrage killing one sentinel but lowering another‚Äôs HP to red. Perfect.¬†

Next turn ochette was able to capture it with ease. I replaced the snow drake, as I feel like it not having a secondary effect is holding it back and I need multishine more.¬†

I forgot one item, and it‚Äôs in merry hills near the entrance to the shrine of ulsterra funnily enough. It‚Äôs called the empowering necklace, and I give it to hikari to help him be a better supportive tank.¬†

Anyways, so that‚Äôs all the errands I need to do for the dawn. I think now I‚Äôll share my team‚Äôs set up as it probably won‚Äôt change much during the dawn. So here they are:¬†

Now that that‚Äôs over with, it‚Äôs time to do the cross paths. All of them have no bosses, except for ochette‚Äôs and Castti‚Äôs. There are some fights in 2 of the second ones (Osvald and hikari‚Äôs) if something interesting happens, I‚Äôll tell you about it. Otherwise, assume it went without much issue.¬†

So something interesting happened during Temenos‚Äô and throne‚Äôs chapter. In the cavern of the sun and moon, I encountered a chubby cait. Partitio was able to dispatch it with a staggering 198 damage. This still doesn‚Äôt get thron√© enough JP for BP regeneration. I need 12000 and I only have \~8000. Still though, it should be soon.¬†

I forgot about the skill that Yomi gives you called Forlorn requiem. It‚Äôs an AOE ice attack that has a chance to sleep. I replace it with lightning falls, as it‚Äôs kinda not as good anymore. Plus forlorn requiem is also powered by the battle tested axe, so I shouldn‚Äôt be losing much power.¬†

Anyways, next up is ochette and castti‚Äôs crosspath. This one is the only one with a true boss fight. I decided that I‚Äôm going in with armsmassti, conjurerer ochette, arcanist Osvald, and thief Partitio. Let‚Äôs do this.¬†

First up against the creeping shadow is Castti who uses icicle for 2600 damage. Ochette then uses provoke beasts to summon 2 light sentinels and 1 cait, knocking off 4 shields and giving an additional 1 BP to all (perfect). Osvald uses elemental barrage, breaking it for 3400 damage. Partitio then 2 boosts with ember for 14500 damage. Next turn, Osvald fully boosts and uses his latent power with the one true magic 2 for the win with around 59000 damage. Nice.¬†

Now all that‚Äôs left is the dawn. I restock up on materials for concoctions like grape leafs, plum leafs, pomegranate leafs, lilies of light, etc. Aswell as medium grapes and plums.¬†

I think this is where I‚Äôll end the session today. I save right in front of where the start of the Dawn will happen. I‚Äôm not entering right now because I might have missed a few things, Though I think it won‚Äôt really matter as Osvald and temenos are already pretty insane and I‚Äôve prepared pretty darn well. Anyways have a great day/evening and stay safe.¬†

Levels and subjobs at the end of the session:¬†

* Cleric Thron√©: 52
* Arcanist Osvald: 50
* Merchant Temenos: 51
* Scholar Agnea: 51
* Thief Partitio: 50
* Inventor Hikari: 51
* Armsmaster Castti: 50
* Conjurerer Ochette: 50",11 May 2024 19:19:38,reddit
700,https://www.reddit.com/r/signalis/comments/1cpt14f/finished_replika_oc_connected_to_a_previous_post/,Finished Replika OC [Connected to a previous post],"**/|\\ BE ADVISED, EUSAN NATION V√úKR UNITS ON THE GRID /|\\**  
**\[Update No. 1\]**

Replika Codename: **V.√ú.K.R ""VULKANKOLIBRI"" | ""VOLCANO HUMMINGBIRD""**

Replika Gender: **Male**

Generation: **Gen 6 S-M-U Commando**

Replika Frame and Height: **Biomechanical with a carbon fiber composite-reinforced Polyethylene Shell, skeleton made from a combination of Titanium and Tungsten alloy at weak points and bullet resistant armor plates. Additional synthetic muscles woven into the skeleton to allow for better recoil control and for better physical prowess in the field.**

***Approximate height is \~212cm***

Replika Description and Notes: **The Vorhut √úberkommando Kammerj√§ger Replikas, also known in english words as the Vanguard Ultra-Commando Exterminator Replikas; were created as last of the Replikas units designed for Universal Special Forces duty after the tides in the War for Exoplanet 24c started to turn for the worse.**

**They were introduced in the Atlantic Theatre in Exoplanet 24c where they reintroduced the primitive tactic of a Blitzkrieg but this time in ground force fashion and with a more modernized flow. The approximate time it took for these 6th Generation Fighters was around six minutes on a compound infested with resistance forces.**

**Nearly every VUKR Unit has an indifferent personality with an extremely stable neural pattern** *\[Note from R&D: Possible Bioresonance applied on self?\]***, usually only listening to the higher-ups and only talking to other Replikants for the sake of getting edge in a future fight. Each interaction is meant for a plan, they always have something planning. It increases cohesion by natural means too.**

***They are the tip of the spear for the Eusan Nation's shadow.***

Replika known issues and Handling: **VUKR Units should be sent off to another mission as quickly as possible or sent off to a training facility to keep them ""fresh"". VUKR Units are based on consistent work, striving to be the best from their natural need to progress faster than others. Vulkankolibri often have sudden cognitive freakouts when taking severe damage, their mental standpoint has a superiority complex embedded into it. The Research and Development team hasn't been able to pick this apart yet, it seems to come from the neutral pattern donor. Said donor was a Vienta War veteran, this could be the explanation for it but it is unlikely.**

**It is... Encouraged that both Gestalt and Replika refrain from provoking a VUKR Unit while they are performing a task except if it is deemed necessary. Socialization with other Replikas or Gestalts should be encouraged, since it can allow the Vulkankolibri the chance to assess other units for better combat performance ratings.**

*\[Notes on Appearance\]*  
*\[Highlights: VUKR Units commonly have dark-purple hair going past the chin. Their eyes have been filed into the category of red as a reddish-brown color. VUKRs usually wear a combat respirator that covers just the mouth to allow for Atomic-Biological-Chemical protection. VUKR Units typically just tie the back of their hair back, leaving the front still there... That's the ONE thing they are lazy with.\]*",11 May 2024 18:32:35,reddit

702,https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasywriters/comments/1cpsxnp/the_four_men_grimdark_500_words/,The Four Men [grimdark 500 words],"The stars did not blink. They were unblinking in their commitment. The four men trudged on in the black. Far off howls that belonged in the waste more than they, echoed across the dry land, land desperate for a watering. But there were no clouds, no rain to be had, no golden harvest on the horizon. Only four men with their red reservoirs ripe for letting.

They took turns riding two good horses. Sand had crept into their boots and sandals like life oft does, unnoticed for a bit, unthought of, then irritating them at first, then tearing at flesh, slowing that ineffable soul down. Black birds and vultures cawed on the rocky outcrops looking down at them. There was no green, in the night. But there was envy in the party of every beast in this land that had adapted to it so, that didn't care that didn't seem to think, that was one with the land, that was one with the way, and the way was everywhere and in all things here, and the way was damnation.

A virgin, an insomniac, a man of honour and an old man with hope were the four. The old man was wise, yet had fought to be a happy fool near all his long life, in vain. Each could have been anything else or anything in-between and they would still be unsuited to this journey. But they did not stop, they trudged on, with iron will and delirium. The insomniac read the map as best he could, holding it close to his grey eyes as if it were a final meal, weaning off light from those stars like a lost hungry babe, never bright enough to lead, only enough to tease.

The four did not look like they needed a roadmap to find damnation, for they were there even before they had arrived. Yet they resisted it all the same. Lo, they trudged on and on. Belonging roars came up, closer now. Too close.


They rushed to the canyons. Panting. Cries of whatever man was not came closer. 

The insomniac withdrew his club.


They all dove headlong into cover over meagre dry bush and indifferent boulder. Scrambling like children up after bedtime upon hearing punishing parents getting closer. Scrambling but not feigning sleep, three picking up their weapons, one damning his devotion to pacifism. They loosed the horses and slapped them to flee away.. And if by some covenant, reckoning came like a genitor to its misbehaved spilled seed of creation.

The rustle of feet that boys know of before they come to learn came unrelenting over the undulating soft dunes. They moved with purpose and flustering speed. Shuttling up over a ridge and down. The men did not reassure each other, this far into perdition, lies were cast off, even though man would follow a lie like a fly to dung before even sniffing at a truth, perfidiousness died when there was no one else around to laud ones conviction of mattering.

The men looked away for the old man told them to do so, affixing their eyes to the silver lit floor. The rush came closer. The smell of putridity and the rot of their species  wafted over and then mockingly hit in a sharp hammer of  insult. The men wretched quietly against their will. They heard ragged breaths of a legion who had seen the light of despair. Who stared at the light, and let it burn through thoroughly, until they were blind and led by the very thing that had raped their sight with thrusts of abandonment. And for this moment to the four, the locusts were omnipotent raring to make parasitic punishment upon those of mankind.

They moved like a tide that only came in, that would never withdraw.

Just as quick as they came like the memories of a dream, they left, trawling over the sand like a farmer harvesting the pain of a sparse field with a thousand devoted scythes. Chasing the steeds in the distance.

The four were indeed awake far past bedtime, so late they might not come to see the sun, so late that they too might be blinded by the bright seduction of the dark. But the four trudged on unrelented, for what else was there to do.

Diak, lit his pipe with the Redrock and shaky hand, he let out a whisper not for the sake of stealth but for that was all he could muster 'does anyone else want to hit this weed, might take that damn edge off a bit eh?'",11 May 2024 18:27:59,reddit
703,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1cpqkc5/this_is_my_story_please_be_kind/,This is My story. Please be kind,"Alex, a downcast gay furry with fur the color of twilight and a tail that drooped like a wilted flower, felt perpetually on the outside looking in. The furry fandom, a world that once pulsed with vibrant creativity and a sense of belonging, now felt distant and mocking. Online interactions were a hollow substitute for real-life connection. He craved friends who understood the thump of his oversized paws, the comfort of his fursona, and the yearning for love that mirrored his own.
One suffocating night, the loneliness became a crushing weight. The whispers of judgment from those who didn't understand echoed in his mind. Despair wrapped its cold tendrils around him, squeezing the joy out of life. In a moment of agonizing clarity, Alex found himself staring down the cold steel barrel of his father's hunting rifle, a relic from a bygone era. The metallic taste of despair filled his mouth.
He closed his eyes, the weight of the rifle a leaden anchor pulling him down. A dream, vivid and unexpected, unfolded behind his closed eyelids. He dreamt of a vast, sun-drenched field. Furries of all shapes and sizes frolicked, their laughter like tinkling bells. His boyfriend, Mark, a playful fox with fire-red fur, nudged him with a snout, his eyes filled with warmth. A strong, handsome lion with a rainbow pride flag draped proudly around his neck offered him a steaming mug of something that smelled like happiness. Panic clawed at him. This vibrant world, this acceptance ‚Äì it was everything he craved. But it was just a dream, a cruel mirage before the inevitable darkness.
He squeezed his eyes tighter, a strangled sob escaping his lips. But the dream persisted. A voice, gruff but filled with love, drifted through the dream world. ""Alex,"" it called, filled with concern. It was Mark.  He opened his eyes, jolted back to the harsh reality of his bedroom. The weight of the rifle felt foreign, obscene in this sudden clarity.
With trembling fingers, he fumbled for his phone, the screen a potential lifeline in the suffocating darkness. Shame threatened to drown him, but the memory of the dream, that glimpse of a world where he belonged, was stronger.  He poured out his heart to Mark, confessing his isolation and the terrifying dream that had shaken him awake.
The reply came, a beacon in the storm. Mark's words were a warm embrace, filled with unwavering love and support. He promised to catch the next flight, the urgency in his voice a lifeline. Tears welled up in Alex's eyes, a mixture of relief and a nascent hope.
But hope was a fragile thing. By the time Mark arrived, a frantic mess of worry, Alex was gone. The police found him, a chilling silence hanging in the air. He woke to the sterile hum of machines and the concerned face of a nurse. His throat was parched, his body a dull ache. Relief washed over him, a bittersweet tide. He had failed. But a new fear gnawed at him ‚Äì his parents. Where were they?
The nurse, sensing his panic, explained his parents were on their way. Hours crawled by, each tick of the clock an agonizing eternity.  Finally, the door creaked open. But it wasn't his parents. It was a lawyer, his face etched with a grim sympathy.
""Your parents..."" the lawyer started, his voice strained. ""They... they couldn't handle it, Alex. They said they needed time.""
Time. A cold dread filled him. The weight of his failed attempt wasn't just his own to bear. He had hurt the ones who loved him, the ones who, despite the distance, had always been there, however imperfectly.
Days turned into weeks. Mark stayed by his side, a beacon of unwavering support. He spoke of the furry community who were sending messages of support, some even planning visits. But the silence from his parents was deafening.
One day, a letter arrived. It was from his parents, their words laced with a heavy grief. They spoke of their disappointment, their inability to reconcile the son they knew with the one who would try to take his own life.  With a finality that echoed in the sterile room, they wrote of their decision to sever ties.
The world spun. The loneliness he thought he'd escaped came crashing back, tenfold. He had almost ended his life, and now, his parents had ended theirs, in a way. The pain was a living thing, a suffocating weight that threatened to consume him.
But Mark wouldn't let him sink.  He reached out to the furry community, explaining the situation.  To Alex's surprise, they rallied. Furries from across the country sent messages of love and support, some even visiting the hospital. He wasn't alone. The dream he'd had, the vibrant world

704,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/1cpqix6/this_is_my_story_please_be_kind/,This is my story. Please be kind,"Alex, a downcast gay furry with fur the color of twilight and a tail that drooped like a wilted flower, felt perpetually on the outside looking in. The furry fandom, a world that once pulsed with vibrant creativity and a sense of belonging, now felt distant and mocking. Online interactions were a hollow substitute for real-life connection. He craved friends who understood the thump of his oversized paws, the comfort of his fursona, and the yearning for love that mirrored his own.
One suffocating night, the loneliness became a crushing weight. The whispers of judgment from those who didn't understand echoed in his mind. Despair wrapped its cold tendrils around him, squeezing the joy out of life. In a moment of agonizing clarity, Alex found himself staring down the cold steel barrel of his father's hunting rifle, a relic from a bygone era. The metallic taste of despair filled his mouth.
He closed his eyes, the weight of the rifle a leaden anchor pulling him down. A dream, vivid and unexpected, unfolded behind his closed eyelids. He dreamt of a vast, sun-drenched field. Furries of all shapes and sizes frolicked, their laughter like tinkling bells. His boyfriend, Mark, a playful fox with fire-red fur, nudged him with a snout, his eyes filled with warmth. A strong, handsome lion with a rainbow pride flag draped proudly around his neck offered him a steaming mug of something that smelled like happiness. Panic clawed at him. This vibrant world, this acceptance ‚Äì it was everything he craved. But it was just a dream, a cruel mirage before the inevitable darkness.
He squeezed his eyes tighter, a strangled sob escaping his lips. But the dream persisted. A voice, gruff but filled with love, drifted through the dream world. ""Alex,"" it called, filled with concern. It was Mark.  He opened his eyes, jolted back to the harsh reality of his bedroom. The weight of the rifle felt foreign, obscene in this sudden clarity.
With trembling fingers, he fumbled for his phone, the screen a potential lifeline in the suffocating darkness. Shame threatened to drown him, but the memory of the dream, that glimpse of a world where he belonged, was stronger.  He poured out his heart to Mark, confessing his isolation and the terrifying dream that had shaken him awake.
The reply came, a beacon in the storm. Mark's words were a warm embrace, filled with unwavering love and support. He promised to catch the next flight, the urgency in his voice a lifeline. Tears welled up in Alex's eyes, a mixture of relief and a nascent hope.
But hope was a fragile thing. By the time Mark arrived, a frantic mess of worry, Alex was gone. The police found him, a chilling silence hanging in the air. He woke to the sterile hum of machines and the concerned face of a nurse. His throat was parched, his body a dull ache. Relief washed over him, a bittersweet tide. He had failed. But a new fear gnawed at him ‚Äì his parents. Where were they?
The nurse, sensing his panic, explained his parents were on their way. Hours crawled by, each tick of the clock an agonizing eternity.  Finally, the door creaked open. But it wasn't his parents. It was a lawyer, his face etched with a grim sympathy.
""Your parents..."" the lawyer started, his voice strained. ""They... they couldn't handle it, Alex. They said they needed time.""

Amongst the thick fog, a disgraced man drifts ever closer to sleep whilst on watch.

Once an honoured Jarl of¬†Jumne, the winds of change have not been kind. Forced from his home due to the petty politicking of his warriors, fortune found its way to the ex-Jarl when he heard of Sturgia‚Äôs planned conquest of Seonon. Quickly gathering his ax and shield, he had arrived at the war camp just in time for the campaign.

The battle was glorious. By right, he had taken his fair share of pillage and loot after the city fell. The Sturgians, of course, were looking for able warriors to keep the peace in the looted villages outside the walls of Seonon. Being promised an estate in the city itself and a hefty wage, the man quickly found himself a guard for the meagre village of Mag Arba.

Even in the war-torn Battania, information travels with peasants and traders rather quickly. Only rumours kept the disgraced Jarl informed. The capture of Car Banseth by the Vlandians and the assassination of the Battanian High King made his post seem pointless. How could the Battanians ever hope to reclaim what they lost without leadership?

How the tides ever change, though. The rise of High King Robert had brought too much joy to the peasantry. More than that, waves of battles won by the High King against the Basilieus and Senate only brought more fervour to the village. One particularly brave fool even tried to spread rumours of an incoming ‚Äúliberation‚Äù led by the High King to reclaim Seonon. The fool lost his tongue for such idiocy.

The fog today wasn‚Äôt great, though. The greenery of the woods blends everything together, and the village itself almost seems isolated from the rest of the world. In this island of misery, he was once again a Jarl in all but name.

Perhaps while Seonon is without a lord, he could redeem his lost honour? By the might of his ax, the city and its inhabitants could be his. No warrior in all of Sturgia would dare oppose him in single combat. By warrior‚Äôs rights, he knew he was practically untouchable, and yet‚Ä¶

Before he could register the slightest sound, a burning pain filled his throat and red poured down upon his chainmail. Gasping for air amidst a gurgling torrent of his own blood, he stumbled, collapsing to the ground. The shaft of an arrow protruding from his neck.

As eternal darkness replaced the greenery, figures emerged from the fog. Countless Battanian warriors marched straight past him, with only a bearded man adorned by a spiked crown giving a passing glance.

Oh Sad Seonon‚Ä¶ the time has come.

# In Meta Terms

Welcome to the thirty-fifth Bannerlord Calradic Campaign! This event will feature the **Battanians** marching against the **Sturgians** to reclaim Seonon.

If the Battanians can defeat the Sturgians on the battlefield, they will attempt to siege **Seonon.** Should their siege fail, they will send some daring riders to claim **Nevyansk Castle** without a fight. If the Sturgians can once again send the wolves of Battania fleeing their forests, **Utheliam Castle** will fall to them. From there, the Sturgians will attempt to siege **Pendraic Castle.**

**Unfamiliar with the Calradic Campaign?**¬†Have no fear! The Calradic Campaign is a casual, player driven, story based event. There are no strict rules or signups, and players of all skill levels often come! If you've never tried multiplayer, now is your best chance to experience large scale formations and battles without the overly strict practices typically found in line battle/clan style events.

Victories in our flagship monthly events are represented on the¬†[overall campaign map](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/404068268668747776/1236781196646813736/CC3-34.png?ex=664081ff&is=663f307f&hm=eb6a43c29ebb3828a3bc6a3cc530ba00f7809e7896e93c39ac4c0cf716f4d93f&), while roleplay surrounding the events and their consequences takes place both during said events and on the¬†[community Discord](https://discord.com/invite/mountandblade).¬†**Joining the Discord**¬†allows you to communicate with your fellow faction members, trash talk others, and rise through the ranks to one day become lord of a village, castle, city, or if you're particularly successful, an entire kingdom!

To join the event,¬†**you will need**¬†our¬†[Calradic Campaign Module](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933062399). This module contains all of the custom battle and siege scenes used, as well as many stability fixes and balance changes.¬†**Most importantly, the module features three distinct empire factions in multiplayer, each with their own unique perks and cosmetics to lean into the different situations of the three!**

There will be a manual installation of the module available for those not playing on Steam. Check the¬†[Nexus mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/5624?tab=description)¬†**no sooner than the Friday**¬†before the event for the correct download. You will need the CalradicCampaign#35 file.

As a general rule of thumb, the Calradic Campaign module should be the only one enabled in your launcher!¬†**If you have any crashes or issues trying to launch the game / join the server,**¬†unsubscribing and resubscribing to the module on workshop will often fix any issues.

Note to clans: While the Calradic Campaign is a public event open to all, clans will not be allowed to organize their own formations and must spread out between teams. Failure to follow these guidelines will result in suspension from the event.
