I hope you can help me with your experience. I'm facing a blue-green algae issue in my 200-liter aquarium (approximately 53 US gallons) and have already taken several measures to get rid of them, unfortunately without success so far. Here are my attempts:

1. BlueExit treatment
2. Increasing plant density with new plants
3. Using ""Phorax"" as a phosphate remover
4. Changing all filter sponges
5. Large water change (70%) followed by weekly changes between 10-15%
6. Using a silicate remover
7. Manual removal of every algae I find
I have attached pictures of my efforts and the current state of my aquarium. If anyone has any ideas or advice, I would be infinitely grateful!

Thank you in advance for your help!",16 Nov 2023 12:22:49

As of a week and a half ago, it was going well. I was at 0 ammonia, 1 nitrite, and 20 nitrates. I have plenty of the weird brown worms. 

My sister gave me some test strips, which I was using until I can get into a lfs this weekend for a water check (I haven’t purchased my own set yet, it’s on my list though). Nitrites, ammonia and nitrates were all registering as 0. I compared to my established tanks to make sure it wasn’t just the tests, and nitrates are reading in good levels on those tanks.

I then realized that the algae that was growing wasn’t just algae, it was Cyanobacteria. I had never seen it before, so it’s new to me. I removed what I could from the substrate (it found itself on some food I had thrown in to “feed” the cycle), the roots of some red root floaters, and one of my lava rocks). 

Is my cycle screwed? I’m finding conflicting information about what exactly this means for my cycle. I’ll be performing a black out for the next few days.",04 May 2024 23:59:44

* both phosphate and nitrate are extremely low (almost undetectable).

**Lighting**: a basic LED tank light. 8 hours per day. 

**filtration**: a well established HOB, the cartridge is a bit old. I assumed this was a good thing?

**Plants**: moderately planted. 

**fish**: low bioload. 2 dwarf rasboras and 3 small amano shrimp. weekly feeding.

Part of the problem is that I had been using deionized water, which has basically no nutrients in it at all. I naively assumed that this would limit the growth of algae, but obviously it hasn't. 

I've seen contradictory information about whether I should add nitrate and phosphate. Some sources say this will simply feed the algae, while other sources claim that a lack of nitrate is the probable cause.

I have a swimming pond / natural pool in my garden which the former house owner used as a koi pond. For some weeks now I have more and more algae growing and now I am concerned that its blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria). I hope someone here can help my identify my problem.

On all surfaces I have this film of algae that is green/brown and easily removable. It does not smell at all (supposed to smell bad for blue-green algae?) but it is very slimy. I have a biofilter with material to mechanically filter the water and to provide gigantic surfaces for good bacteria to live in. In addition I also have a UCV-clearer. Still, the algae appeared. My simple water tests show me no nitrates or nutritions, so I don’t really know where it comes from. But maybe my tests are just bad.

Based on the attached pictures, can someone tell me what kind of algae I have? Is it blue-green algae and makes this my pool unsafe to swim in? What could I do to remove it and make sure it doesn’t come back and I can swim in it again?

Last picture is the status I would like to get back to! :)

I chimed in that when I had been much younger, I was attracted to a weird regimen of gelatin treats like Jello, the odd papaya powder pill, the vitamin niacin and something else, probably chewable vitamin c. This prompted a third person to ask what the big deal was about gelatine, and my reply was approximately that shark collagen was the naz, being from an animal that went back to the Jurassic, over 500,000,000 years ago, and who theoretically was more undifferentiated, so accessible to either existing vestigial defense-systems, or some such cooperation, as if one cares why exactly the Amazon rainforest does what it does, versus stem cells from infant cadavers.

What's the difference between gelatin and collagen? Let alone, after digesting it with something like papain? Nyeh? Does one need to go to cadavers if all one is after is a smidgin of building block?

Hello,

There's this strip of algae on the substrate only across the front of the tank. I first filled the tank 3 months ago so it's had some time to cycle. Fish and plants are otherwise healthy as near as I can tell. The tank has an automated light that follows the sun. The tank does not receive direct sunlight.

I do 30% RO water changes and clean the substrate weekly but it has not abated. In fact it seems to be creeping it's way towards the back of the tank. What could I change in my routine to potentially impact it's growth? Why is it only that strip?

By Paul McClure
October 09, 2023

Researchers have used plasma technology to transform a species of blue-green microalgae into a bioactive coating with incredible wound-healing properties. They say the novel coating can be applied to dressings and medical devices to protect patients from infection, speed up healing and reduce inflammation.

Plasma is formed from gas so superheated that the electrons are ripped away from the atoms, resulting in a soup of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. An atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) provides a plasma discharge at ambient pressure using a noble gas/molecular gas mixture passed through a powerful electric arc discharge.

Researchers at Flinders University, South Australia, have used an argon APPJ to convert blue-green microalgae into an ultrathin bioactive coating that can be added to medical dressings to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation and promote wound healing.

“We are using the plasma coating technology to turn any type of biomass – in this case Spirulina maxima – into a sustainable high-end coating,” said Vi Khanh Truong, one of the study’s corresponding authors. “With our technology, we can transform biomass into coatings on wound dressing.”

Extract of S. maxima, a species of blue-green microalgae, is often used as a dietary supplement. The unicellular organism possesses a simple reproductive system that generates a biomass containing bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant and antibacterial properties that can assist with wound healing.

However, the thick cell walls of the microalgae pose a significant obstacle to extracting these valuable compounds. That’s where APPJ comes in. The researchers used the technology to selectively break down the microalgae’s thick walls, which resulted in a significant transformation. S. maxima lost its native structure, completely disintegrated, and subsequently reformed into ultrathin films.

A schematic depicting the one-step argon APPJ process to transform S. maxima biomass into an ultrathin bioactive coating and its applicationPham et al.
The antibacterial activity of the argon APPJ-treated S. maxima was assessed and found to be highly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with 93% and 73% cell death, respectively, and inhibited biofilm formation. Bacteria inside biofilm are much more resistant to antibiotics.

In addition to being biocompatible, the S. maxima coating exhibited anti-inflammatory properties. And a wound created by the researchers using wound scratch assay was completely closed in two days when the coating was used.

The researchers say this novel technique holds promise as a wound treatment, including the treatment of chronic wounds, particularly given the rise in antibiotic resistance.

“This new, plasma-facilitated downstream processing can improve extraction and purification of useful compounds from biomass without the need for harmful solvents and a lot of energy input,” said Krasimir Vasilev, the other corresponding author of the study. “We are now exploiting avenues for commercialization of this unique technology. Currently, there is no commercial wound dressings that simultaneously fight and protect from infection, favorably modulate inflammation and stimulate healing.”

The study was published in the journal Small.

He is a well loved fish, but only myself, one specific student, and another teacher are allowed to feed him (the previous beta at the school was seriously over fed by students- very sad.)
