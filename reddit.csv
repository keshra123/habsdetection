The cyanobacteria was already there, I just thought it was algae.  I found out yesterday that it is not algae.  Since last night I have changed the lighting to just dim green so the fish aren't in total dark, turned the bubbler back on, and removed the zeolite pack from the filter (I forgot it was in there). Also, I turned down the heater to 72deg F.

TL;DR - how do I fix this without killing the fish and plants?

The lifeboat crews are no longer training on the water and have instructions not to go near it unless it's ""a life or death situation"" after some of their crew fell ill from the bacteria. 
The loch has been abused, with discharges from farming and sewage, dredging for sand and probably many more problems. 
It's even more of a problem with NI's government issues meaning there is no environment minister to take charge of the disaster.
This is collapse related because this Lough supplies 40% of the drinking water for Northern Ireland and with the lack of leadership this problem has the potential to become even worse.",16 Sep 2023 02:30:19

Hey, all. So, I‚Äôve got an approx 1 year old tank, started it with a mix of various frags after the bacteria-in-a-bottle start. It‚Äôs a little IM AIO Lagoon, 25 gallons. It reached the point where the coral was surviving but not ‚Äòthriving‚Äô‚Äîalso had a spontaneous colony of pods that was fat and health, they eventually died off. 

Turns out, there were NO nutrients in the tank (I did give the occasional reef roids feeding).  So, finally added a fish (purple firefish). I feed it the frozen brine shrimp (I just shave a little from the cube, but what he‚Äôll eat), but I notice everywhere I dump it in, there is cyano all over that specific spot next day. 

TL;DR version: recommendation for a fish food that leaves less garbage behind? (Yes I know there is a limit to that btw nature). Thanks!

I‚Äôd be grateful for advice. I have an established 250L mixed reef (8+ years) and for the last six weeks I‚Äôve been struggling with diatoms and Cyanobacteria. 

Parameters at the last test (also confirmed with an external ICP test):
- PH 8.0
- SG 1.025
- KH 7 (dose every other day, always runs between 7-8 and has done for 8 years)
- Ammonia <0.05
- Nitrite 0.05 
- Nitrate 1
- Phosphate <0.02
- Silicate <0.1
- Calcium 440 
- Magnesium 1280

I dose Seachem fusion 1 and 2 every other day, have done for about a year. 

I run carbon and Rowaphos, no changes in how I run them or batch of either. 

UV unit is definitely working (indicator light says so anyway). 

Lights are LEDs (Juwel Multilux - has to be a closed top tank because otherwise the cat climbs in it). Have been running for four years, same bulbs. 

Fish are all fine. Corals mostly fine, have lost a few heads of Euphyllia over the duration but everything else is fine (lots of euphyllia, stylophora, Duncan, blasto, candy cane, acropora, favia and toadstool all fine). 

Nothing has changed that I can think would induce the bloom. Things I‚Äôve tried so far and seen no improvement:

- Changed UV unit bulb and cleaned inside unit. 
- Rinsed filter media (always done on schedule and sponges changed regularly on schedule, no difference over last 8 years) and cleaned pipes. 
- Sequential 10% water changes daily for a week (including vacuuming of the sand bed). 
- 60% water change. 
- Added more clean up crew (4 weeks ago, no change)
- Salt batch is the same as I‚Äôve been using for 8 months but I changed it as a precaution, still no improvement. 
- Changed RO/DI resin and membranes, no improvement (TDS 0).
- Filter bacteria addition. 
- Tried various angles of circulation and wave pumps, no change. 
- Reduced light cycle by two hours, no change.

As the call for sustainable and plant-based alternatives to traditional animal products grows louder, researchers at the University of Copenhagen are exploring a unique solution involving blue-green algae, specifically cyanobacteria. In a recent study led by Professor Poul Erik Jensen of the Department of Food Science, the team demonstrated the potential of cyanobacteria to produce a protein with fibrous strands resembling the texture of meat fibers. This breakthrough could pave the way for sustainable, protein-rich foods with minimal processing, addressing environmental concerns and the quest for the right mouthfeel in plant-based products.

Cyanobacteria, often known as blue-green algae, have been manipulated to produce a protein not naturally found in their composition. By inserting foreign genes into cyanobacteria, the researchers observed the protein organizing itself into fibrous strands or nanofibers. This fibrous structure holds promise for mimicking the texture of meat, cheese, or other desired food products.

Only problem is we started college back in September, things got very busy and she started to neglect cleaning the tank. It went from weekly water changes to once every 2-3 weeks though I encouraged her to do it more often, the water remained clear as day and the plants seems to keep the nitrates low enough that the livestock weren‚Äôt at risk. 

However, after a little this slimy blue-green algae started to take over very fast. I got her to get an air pump, lower the lights, etc. this has worked for the most part but it‚Äôs still around and we can eradicate it 100%. I lives in the substrate and just keeps slowly growing back. 

The tank is kept at around 75f, no nitrates/nitrites/ammonia. gH and kH are a little high but I can‚Äôt do anything about that, we have slightly hard water and can‚Äôt afford an RODI system.

It used to be manageable, until all my GSP do not come out anymore, and my torches, hammers, and anemones are shrunk throughout the day. The fishes are fine. 

Since the discovery of Cyano, i have tried many things, including,

1. shortening the light schedule to 1-8-1.

2. measure PAR to make sure my light isn't too strong. it measured 50~150 from bottom to top. 

3. Applied chemiclean and siphon out/carboned out after 3 days. This did resolve it, but it quickly came back within 2 days. I have since then tried redosing chemiclean, and didn't see any results even 3 days after dosing. 

4. I realize that my phosphate is bottomed out, and I have been dosing Neophos without any measureable change according to Hanna LR checker

5. Dosing microbacteria 7

191,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarium/comments/191axbz/cyanobacteria_my_early_journey/,Cyanobacteria - my early journey,"The attached video is from earlier in my tank. I think I might have had an anaerobic growth of cyanobacteria under the sand that you can see around 48-50 seconds into the video. I removed about 20 pounds of sand today and did a manual cleaning. I'm looking for more advice/insight or discussion to help others learn how to identify and how to treat. Obviously, also maybe what not to do...

In the past week I had some green looking algae on the sand. My siamese algae eaters and the snails have been avoiding it. I went researching and I saw a post on Reddit about algae on sand, and it was identified as cyanobacteria. 

Here is what I gleaned from research: 

* Manually remove as much of this as possible from surfaces. 
* Thrives in the water column. Can also be anaerobic.
* Can be a result of over feeding or too much light. 
* Discussions about phosphorous and nitrate imbalance, mostly phosphorous in excess
* UV can be used to cleanse the water but without manual removal consider it could be futile
* Antibiotics (ethromycin) can be helpful, but again nothing happens without manual removal. 
* Other green slime treatments folks swear by
* Cool article about managing the phosphorous level but I'm too novice to try all the math, nitrite and phosphorous level calculations today while this crap is actively a problem in my tank. I'll call it #AquariumHusbandryGoals
* Talk of a smell (my water smells like clean water)
* Scrub pieces of decor with a tooth brush to remove

Anyhoo - today I planned to do as much manual removal as I could. I used my python to clean the sand.

* I think I found an anaerobic pocket as I found a big area of sand that I could not get clean from in the tank so I removed it (about 20# of sand if dry) and cleaned it in a bucket until the water ran clear. It is not back in the tank yet. 
   * InFact, I think I had it early in my tank and I have seen it and wondered what it was - but I did not take it seriously until it manifested on the surface. This is my novice. 
   * There is a smell - like lake water when it has turned rancid or something toward the shore. A small bit fishy but just like warm canal water. Even after a shower I can't stop smelling it today. I'm a nurse, this happens sometimes. I hate it though.
* Took out all the decor, and cleaned what I could. Could not return 2 pieces of dragon stone, nor 3 pieces of decor for the smell. 

I ran a toothbrush and melamine sponge over the other items 

* The 3D printed items came clean enough I placed them back in the tank. 
* The dragon stone with visible algae and a smell got soaked in vinegar. 
* The three pieces of decor had no visible or no significant blue/green look but had the most pungent smell. 
   * All I had on hand was cleaning vinegar and bleach. My bleach has additives so to me vinegar was the safest option to try to remove the odor and growth on the items that did not come clean. 

The UV light is now 'on' in my canister filter to treat the water column. 

Plan another superficial vacuum tomorrow and check for any more pockets. Have cut my light significantly. Floating plants are in my indoor staging pond as I will be conducting more cleanings and want the extra floating and water column plants out of the way so I can clean more efficiently over the next several days. 

Fish are all okay, but they have become accustomed to me in the tank top or bottom, right or left so we did our little dance today and they seem pretty happy and not too stressed after less than 10 minutes after me ending in-tank efforts. I do hand feed a few so they followed me around like - hey mom - what are you doing? Got any pellets for me? \*lol\* 

What else do I need to do or consider? Otherwise, consider this an opportunity to discuss (or research and learn) on what it is to see and treat this bacteria. 

\*oof, I am tired today\*

This extends to a lot of parts of the world, setting new records of such blooms, due to rising temperatures and stuff like fertilizer and septic tanks seeping into the ground wherever there is aggressive industrial agriculture and human settlement around. I‚Äôve seen some posts here that also looked like this, so I am hoping to spread a bit of awareness and attention to this very dangerous toxic event. 

Please find your local information on cyanobacterial blooms in your area and when you see it, please exercise caution, don‚Äôt touch it, breathe in the fumes etc.!! There may also be a monitoring place in your area you can report this to. 

It only takes a quick online search to learn how to identify it, and there are plenty of interesting satellite images on how it looks like and is spreading throughout the world. 

If you can, please join efforts to keep our nature healthy and clean, through rewilding efforts or advocacy for climate justice and safeguarding policies for all of our ecosystems. 


‚ÄúAbundant growth of cyanobacteria in freshwater, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems due to increased anthropogenic eutrophication and global climate change has created serious concern toward harmful bloom formation and surface water contamination all over the world. Cyanobacterial blooms and the accumulation of several cyanotoxins in water bodies pose severe ecological consequences with high risk to aquatic organisms and global public health.‚Äù

Well, this new year I decided to put on my best wizard robe (a very plush blue bathrobe) and conjure this Algal Bloom out from its wretched swamp prison. I dont know what gods off new or old bestowed new ears upon me, but HARK! Here is a truly glorious fuzz!

If you want doom, it splits the speakers asunder with cascading boulders from a collapsing mountain!

If you want crust, it velcro rips like a skateboard landing on a pile of vhs cassette tapes!

Sits in front of window getting MANY hours of direct sunlight, so algae had been developing significantly, until a week ago, i scraped it all away from the tank sides. Then, in the days following, the water itself developed this green tint that has barely changed following a water change 2 days ago. That was the first day that i saw my nitrites finally get to zero, and am wanting to add fish soon, but i do not want to do that until this algae issue is resolved. I hear that this ‚Äúgreen water‚Äù issue is common in new tanks, and will work itself out as the tank becomes completely cycled. Is this true? Would adding a UV sterilizer help or do i just need to keep doing water changes and let this fix itself? I know the amount of sunlight is a factor, but this is not a factor i can change AND prior to me scraping the algae from the sides, the water was perfectly clear. I‚Äôve only done one water change since starting the cycle since i was waiting for nitrites to be fully converted, and last time i measured, the nitrates were very high. If i continue to do water changes, getting the nitrates back to a normal level, is that going to solve this? Right now my focus is continuing to add ammonia and bacteria until i get to the point where ammonia and nitrite are at zero in 24 hours, following the ammonia addition, but i also need to get this algae problem solved before i add fish. I should also add that i rarely have the aquarium light on since it gets so much natural light.

I've been giving a campfire talk about marine mammals for a few months and I'm stuck on one part. My program covers both smaller marine mammals (dolphins, seals, otters, sea lions) and big baleen whales and their role in the ocean. I talk about how harmful algal blooms can cause domoic acid poisoning in smaller marine mammals and have the audience participate in a ""play"" about HABs and beached marine mammal safety and rescue. Then, we talk about whales and I talk about how their iron-rich feces causes beneficial algal blooms, which replenish their food sources, showing the intricacy of ocean ecosystems.

I try really hard to make it clear that harmful and beneficial algal blooms are not the same event and that whale feces is good for the ecosystem, but I wish there were a way to work that into the program better. Only a small percentage of algae produce domoic acid and phytoplankton provide like 40% of the oxygen we breathe. It's a little difficult to interpret these things to visitors, especially when scientists aren't even sure exactly what causes algal blooms. It seems that global warming and agricultural run-off are contributing factors, but there's also been some new discoveries with bacteria being a factor as well.

I don't know if I'm just not using the right search terms or asking the right people, but I've found it really hard to find research that shows the distinction between beneficial and harmful algal blooms. I'm very hesitant to go with ""nature/animals good, human bad"" because it's very simplified and not really accurate, and provokes feelings of guilt and a warped idea of the balance of the ecosystem. Does anyone have advice, either for interpreting or for a good resource to look into? Should I separate these into two different talks, or keep the importance of establishing that algae is usually ""good""? Has anyone had a similar finicky problem in an interp program? How have you been able to successfully interpret complicated ecological problems?",18 Aug 2023 17:48:32

This Northern Irish Lake succumbing to toxic algae has unleashed a dire environmental crisis. Fish populations are plummeting, and the growth of toxic algae is rendering the lake a noxious and un-swimmable expanse. The root cause of this catastrophe lies in the relentless dumping of fertilizers into the lake resulting in eutrophication. Eutrophication is a process by which a body of water becomes progressively enriched with minerals and nutrients, namely phosphorous and nitrogen, which thereby stimulates the growth of algae. This tragic situation not only imperils the livelihoods of local residents who depend on the lake for sustenance (it is the source of 40% of Northern Ireland‚Äôs drinking water), as well as economic life but also poses a severe threat to the wildlife that calls Lough Neagh home.

As blue-green algal blooms multiply, environmental group that was established to protect our largest freshwater lake hits out at ‚Äòyears of neglect‚Äô by government departments

Liam Tunney
Today at 05:30

Lough Neagh has been treated like a ‚Äúbucket for waste‚Äù, the manager of a group set up to protect it has said.
Blue-green algae blooms have emerged at a number of locations on our largest freshwater lake.
The algae, a type of cyanobacteria, is usually invisible, but in warm, still water with plenty of nutrients it can multiply, forming a bloom.
The bloom can be toxic to animals and humans.
Gerry Darby of the Lough Neagh Partnership said: ‚ÄúThis is not an overnight phenomenon.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the 50 years of neglect, maybe more, but you do need to go back to the long hot summers of the mid-1970s if you want a time when the algae was so bad.
‚ÄúRight now we‚Äôre seeing the result of a perfect storm. The one degree rise in temperature we have monitored is a factor.
‚ÄúThe warm June, then heavy rainfall of July washing slurry, nitrates and farm waste into waterways... have all combined, along with the high nitrates level which was already in the water, to help the algae bloom.
‚ÄúThere has been no environmental policy, no climate policy, no coherent farm management policy ‚Äî the algae everyone is talking abut now is the symptom, not the problem.
‚ÄúBut where has this hysteria been until now? There‚Äôs only a fuss now that the problem we have warned about has appeared.
‚ÄúWhat we are left with is Lough Neagh as a bucket of waste which no one takes any responsibility for.‚Äù
    
NI Water said the algae poses no threat to the drinking water supply, and rejected any suggestion it releases waste into Lough Neagh.
It said: ‚ÄúDrinking water supplied from the water treatment works which use Lough Neagh and the River Bann as raw water sources are designed with algae in mind and provide robust treatment and disinfection.
‚ÄúManagement of the lough is a multi-agency responsibility and, similar to other catchments across NI, there is a complex range of pressures across multiple sectors impacting on the water quality.
‚ÄúNI Water does not pump raw sewage into Lough Neagh. Final treated wastewater from our wastewater treatment works is discharged to Lough Neagh through the works‚Äô outfall pipes. These discharges are regulated by NI Environment Agency.
‚ÄúDuring periods of heavy rainfall, highly diluted wastewater may also be discharged from combined sewer overflows, which are design features on a wastewater system, acting as emergency relief points.‚Äù
    
    
The scale of the algae has sparked concern among anglers.
The Food Standards Agency said consuming fish from waters where algal blooms are present poses an ‚Äúunknown health risk‚Äù.
Kathryn Baker of the organisation said: ‚ÄúCommercial fisheries, such as those that supply shops and restaurants, must make sure they have adequate safety controls in place to ensure the fish they place on the market is safe to eat.
‚ÄúThey will assess the local situation to determine the risks, and will adapt these controls as necessary.
‚ÄúWhilst not all blue-green algae blooms are toxic, you cannot tell whether it is just by looking at it. As a precaution, we are advising recreational anglers not to eat any fish from waters affected by blue-green algal blooms.‚Äù
Watch: Algae bloom leaves swamp-like surface at Lough Neagh quay
The Public Health Agency warns against eating fish caught in the lough.
David Kennedy of Crumlin & District Angling Association said it had urged members to be wary about eating their catch from rivers around the lough.
He added: ‚ÄúMost of the anglers are catch and release, but some do like to take them home.
‚ÄúAnglers have been raising the issue of pollution levels in our rivers and Lough Neagh for years now. We are the eyes and ears of our rivers.
‚ÄúThe algal blooms feed off the nitrates, phosphates and ammonia that is part and parcel of agricultural pollution.
‚ÄúWhen we look at the press statements that went out in early June, when the first algal blooms appeared, it was blamed on high temperatures and high levels of sun and a bit of clearing (dredging) of Lough Neagh.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all contributing factors, but we‚Äôve just had the wettest July on record, with below average temperatures and sunlight, yet Lough Neagh is absolutely covered in toxic algal blooms, which means there has to be another contributory factor driving this.
‚ÄúWe believe that is the pollution, and we want to know why the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) aren‚Äôt saying this publicly and dealing with the sources of it.‚Äù
DAERA was approached for comment.

Even though our government invests billions into well covered landfills and garbage disposal facilities? 

Well, China ships tons of trash down to the Lema islands (a bunch of islands to the south of HK) into uncovered landfills that basically allow whatever trash to fall into the ocean, polluting the whole area, seriously affecting the local ecosystems contributing to the recently increasing amount of algal blooms and the rapid deterioration of a biological hotspot (pearl river delta).

I know the treatments for the two situations are pretty different‚Äî bacterial, leave it alone; algae, large water change, lower nutrients, lower light.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong here though). 

To me it looks like algae, but I don't want to risk treating it when I could very well be messing up the established bacteria.

Tank history: 
- 40gal breeder started about 6 months ago, cycled with driftwood and a couple plants, snails.  
- Added 20 neon tetras after 3 weeks
- Slowly added additional fish and plants over the next couple months.  Now have about 50 small schooling fish (tetras, barbs and 1 pleco), tons of snails and shrimp. 

System & Maintenance:
- CO2 (started 2 weeks ago) about 4 bubbles per second 
- 2x 30"" Aquarium Co-op lights
- Water temp: 78¬∞
- Sponge filter, cleaned maybe 1x a month
- 30ish% water change 1x a week
- Occasional gravel vac 
- Only have trimmed plants once.  
- 4 pumps Aquarium Co-op Easy green fertilizer 1-2x a week 


My guess is, because this all started a week or so after I added CO2, that it is an algae bloom.  The CO2 along with the lights (is that much light too much? I feel like I might have too much light) sent algae into over drive. 


Current plan if y'all agree it's an algae bloom: 
- large water change 
- lower the light
- cut down CO2? 
- cut down ferts? 

Sound good?  

Thanks guys, appreciate the knowledge pool here.

BACKSTORY: 

I have a 29 gallon tank that previously only had some plants, but no live animals. The tank recently had a mild case of green thread algae, and now has a serious algae bloom. 

I had bought some cherry shrimp before the algae bloom to take care of the green thread algae, but they all died within a week, which I'm guessing helped the bloom happen. I was confident I had removed all the dead shrimp.

I had a very busy week with work and family stuff, so I just kept the lights off and ignored the tank until this morning. I was about to do a 2/3 water change and hope for the best for the plants, when I discovered a single live shrimp. I originally planned to do a water change and then black out the tank.

QUESTIONS:

Do I leave the shrimp in the tank? Or should I try to move it into my 5.5 gallon tank that has plants and a betta? Should I get more shrimp?

He was a happy, friendly, and seemingly healthy little guy and the kids LOVED him. I came into work this morning and he was dead, and I'm wondering if it was something I could have prevented.

For background, I have never had a pet fish before, but I went to an agricultural high school and majored in animal science, so I learned a lot about fish care. I take animal care very seriously. Before purchasing this fish, I did a lot of research. His tank was 5 gallons, with a filter and a heater set to 78F and an LED light on the tank lid. He had synthetic plants and little toys to hide in.¬†I did a \~10% water change once a week with a siphon, with spring water treated with conditioner. He was fed once a day. I did pH tests about once a month and they always came back normal. I always washed my hands before putting them in and rinsed off anything going into the tank with cold water. I cleaned his filter frequently and changed the filter cartridge once a month. His tank was super clean, even patrons commented on how clear the water was and how happy he looked.

Around November, he suddenly developed a lot of brown algae in his tank. This lasted for several weeks, and I was cleaning the tank by hand constantly. After researching, I took out the filter and his toys and plants, and scrubbed them all down with hydrogen peroxide. Then I rinsed them really well, let them dry, and put them back in the tank. The brown algae problem cleared up within a few days. His tank went back to normal for a few months. Around mid January, he suddenly developed a green algae bloom in his water. The water just looked really green and cloudy. I read that it is not harmful to fish, but it was hard for everyone to see him. I took out his filter, toys etc, scrubbed them all down really well, rinsed them really well and put them back in the tank. His tank remained cloudy, but I was hopeful it would clear up in about a week or so. Staff reported that on Thursday and Friday (I wasn't in) he was acting normal and eating. I came into work this morning (Saturday) to find him dead on the gravel.¬†

I'm really sad about it, and I know the kids are going to be really upset. Could his filter have not been working properly, even though it was running, and that's what caused the algae bloom? Did the algae bloom kill him? Did \*I\* kill him? I know fish sometimes die suddenly without explanation, but he seemed so healthy just the day before, and I feel like the algae bloom is somehow connected. Anyone have any insight? I'm just disappointed that we only had him for 8 months and I feel like it's my fault somehow. Thanks in advance.",17 Feb 2024 12:37:14

Hi Everyone,

Recently setup a 20gal planted tank on Sunday in which I have a variety of plants as well as 9 Neocaridina shrimp and 2 nerite snails.

Since Sunday, everything seemed to be in great condition and I was noting some healthy plant growth. But reaching home this evening I noticed early algae growth. The glass and other surfaces of the tank is beginning to grow a coating with a few spots being more concentrated (see brown spots on glass in 5th pic). From my aquarium experience ai believe it to be Diatoms?

The first 2 pictures are from Sunday, while the rest are from today.

What is the best thing I can do to keep the algae at bay? I‚Äôm unsure as to whether or not cutting back on light hours will affect my plants that need it. I‚Äôd love to learn and hear what others have to say. Tank currently gets about 12 hours of light per day from two 24W LED lights made for indoor plants. 

TL:DR; It‚Äôs day 5 of my new tank and I see algae forming. It gets 12 hours of light. I need help to prevent further growth without impacting my plants.",08 Dec 2023 02:35:32

When I added fish it started going cloudy again, and I assumed it was just another bacterial bloom, but now it seems a bit greenish, and doesnt seem to get better, only worse.  
   It currently hosts 7 glo Danios, 9 blue neocardina shrimp, 4 mystery snails and some other snails which kinda just appeared.  
   Plants: a big bush of Camboba, a few anubias, small piece of hornwort(constatly cut it and throw out), big bush of some red plant which name I dont know, lots of java/stringy moss, some baby dwarf tears and 3 marimo balls(also some floaters, dont know the name as well)  
   Also, if it helps - my ammonia and nitrates are at 0, both were like this for at least 2 weeks, I add co2(dropchecker is constantly at green/light green), I have also been dousng it with liquid fertiliser, although I gave it around 1.5 more times than specified on label(since it said that more needed for heavily planted tanks), ph is at 7.5.

391,https://i.redd.it/hkn4e3ancyvc1.jpeg,I think I‚Äôm beating my bacterial-turned-algae bloom!,"(Really long, sorry ‚Ä¶ and please excuse the appearance of my tank; it is currently in the ICU, and I use a yellow/green lighting at 10% after 8pm).

So, it looks as if I might be winning that *OBNOXIOUS* assed bacterial bloom that turned into an algae explosion.  Hubby finally stepped in ‚Ä¶ *without* the threatened piranhas (even longer story).

I know now why it happened (a series of things), and have taken note of steps to correct each of the issues.

Saturday, Hubby had me go back to basics ‚Ä¶ which worried the hell out of me because my tank had JUST finished cycling (according to my API master test kit :  0 ammonia, 0 nitrates, 1 nitrate).  Yeah, I know, not much in the nitrate department ‚Ä¶ but it held for three straight days and my nitrates even went up a tad that morning).  But, I couldn‚Äôt stand the pea soup any longer.  So here‚Äôs what we did:

First, we took anything out of the tank that wasn‚Äôt either moving or rooted into the substrate.
    ‚Ä¢  All artificial decorations went into a bucket for complete dry out for the next week or two due to a pond and ramshorn snail infestation.
     ‚Ä¢  Every snail I could find (besides my mystery snails), no matter how small went into Hubby‚Äôs new tank ‚Ä¶ I lost interest in counting after 40.
     ‚Ä¢ Remaining plants were all trimmed of any leaves that weren‚Äôt 90% perfect.  Then, I grouped all the sad remains together and, where necessary, replanted them in groups.  All rooted plants got a root tab or two.
     ‚Ä¢  All remaining plants went into a gallon jug with aquarium water and was set aside.

Second, we addressed the tank itself:
     ‚Ä¢  Drained the tank water waaaaaay down ‚Ä¶ like within 2‚Äù of the substrate.
     ‚Ä¢  Gently stirred up the water as it drained so as much debris as possible went out with the water (debris was for two primary reasons:  too much food - I never had fish before, so this is a learning curve for me - and melted leaves and other plant debris).
     ‚Ä¢  Cleaned all glass surfaces the best I could because even after letting it sit, you still couldn‚Äôt see those bottom 2‚Äù well at all.
     ‚Ä¢  Gently stirred up the debris again, this time netting out as much as I could.

Third, we decided to address temporary filtration measures:
     ‚Ä¢  Cleaned my primary filter (rinsed first in old tank water then gently and quickly with tap (well water)
     ‚Ä¢  Added a secondary 30-60 HOB filter to the front of the tank for now
     ‚Ä¢  Added a UV sterilizer to the 2nd filter
     ‚Ä¢  Added circulation pump to the corner
     ‚Ä¢  Added itty bitty air stones in each corner (I haven‚Äôt hooked up my CO2 yet, and I think another part of the problem I was having was oxygenation of the water.  I had a CO2 drop checker in my tank just because I was curious; it was always unable to decide if it wanted to be blue or just really dark green?)

Next, we refilled it and turned everything on.  It was still cloudy as hell and still had a definite green tint to it, but all I added was a standard tank dosage of API Quick Start.  We gave it 8 hours to run, then only emptied the debris from both filters, stirred things up again, and let it run until this morning.

This morning things were still cloudy, but at least it didn‚Äôt look like milky pea soup and the substrate looked relatively clean again.

Decided to take the opportunity to test out my feeding amounts.  Sprinkled in some Hikari Vibra Bites (about 4 per fish ‚Ä¶ 17 fish total), and some Hikari freeze dried blood worms for the tetras (about 2 per tetra - this distracted the tetras enough to give the corys a chance at the other food).  A couple hours later, only a bit of food was still there, so figured I‚Äôd see how long it took them to clean it up (sorry kids, no second breakfast anymore!)

This evening, there was not a hint of food anywhere, so I will be halving the amount from this morning to make sure it wont be sitting there decaying.  I emptied debris out of filters again, stirred it up once more and let it run.  Decided to add 1/2 dosage of API Accu Clear and about two hours later, I can easily and clearly see to the back of the tank.

From what I have read, now that all the debris and toxins are gone, and the green water algae appears to be dead as well that I should do another 50% water change (tomorrow provided its still clear) to remove that dead algae so it doesn‚Äôt feed another algae bloom.

393,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantedTank/comments/13rozlm/help_with_an_algae_bloom/,Help with an algae bloom.,"I have 29 gallon tank with 2 Australian Rainbows, Plecostomus, and upside-down catfish. I have one plant in there, I'm not sure what it's called. I'm ok with the algae on the walls and logs in the tank so that the pleco has something to eat. The tank is in front of a window, and I have a led tank light that I switch to white during the day and blue during the night. Here recently, my tank water has turned green which from my understanding is an algae bloom. This hasn't been a problem before and has been in front of the window for 4-5 years.

How do I stop this without hurting the plant? Is blocking the light from the window and limiting the amount of time I have the light on enough to stop the bloom? How long should I leave the light on?

I'm a beginner to this, so any help would be greatly appreciated.",25 May 2023 14:14:50

Hello ‚Äì I‚Äôve done my best to look through past posts and it‚Äôs answered some of my questions, but wanted to make sure my intended course of action sounds right.

&#x200B;

The context: 

I‚Äôm a moron who has inherited a problematic goldfish without a home. I made up as large of an aquarium as I could manage, just to keep the goldfish alive until I can find him a foster home with a much larger tank. In the meantime‚Ä¶

&#x200B;

The Tank: 

30 gallons with \~4‚Äù of sand substrate, fairly well planted, one hanging filter and one SICCE canister filter with sponge and the little ceramic-tube media. The tank has been very stable for about three months. 

Stable being: 0ppm nitrite, 0ppm nitrate, 120ppm carbonate hardness, 160ppm water hardness, and a pH hovering around 7.5. The goldfish seemed happy, and is living with three fancy shrimp and 5 snails.

&#x200B;

The Problem:

Woke up one morning to find an explosion of white algae. Internet advice said to try and keep the tank dark. In two days this killed off the bloom, but a water test showed I now had a nitrite level of 3ppm. So I did a water change, brought it back down to <.25 ppm. 

The next day, the bloom was back.

&#x200B;

I‚Äôve been stuck in this cycle for almost two weeks now. I‚Äôve added five more fancy shrimp (total of 8 now) to help munch algae, so it cycles quicker: 

I‚Äôll notice a bloom, 

the shrimp and lack of light (overhead light stays off) kill off the bloom, 

I‚Äôll have a spike in nitrite (about 2ish parts per million)

I change out about 5 gallons of water,

The bloom returns within 12 hours of the water change.

&#x200B;

Looking through other posts, it seems like I may need to let this play out without changing the water - add/let the bacteria, substrate, and fairly mature plants cycle the nitrite. 

But I‚Äôll take any additional advice! ",26 Mar 2024 11:54:01

I hope you can help me with your experience. I'm facing a blue-green algae issue in my 200-liter aquarium (approximately 53 US gallons) and have already taken several measures to get rid of them, unfortunately without success so far. Here are my attempts:

1. BlueExit treatment
2. Increasing plant density with new plants
3. Using ""Phorax"" as a phosphate remover
4. Changing all filter sponges
5. Large water change (70%) followed by weekly changes between 10-15%
6. Using a silicate remover
7. Manual removal of every algae I find

As of a week and a half ago, it was going well. I was at 0 ammonia, 1 nitrite, and 20 nitrates. I have plenty of the weird brown worms. 

My sister gave me some test strips, which I was using until I can get into a lfs this weekend for a water check (I haven‚Äôt purchased my own set yet, it‚Äôs on my list though). Nitrites, ammonia and nitrates were all registering as 0. I compared to my established tanks to make sure it wasn‚Äôt just the tests, and nitrates are reading in good levels on those tanks.

I then realized that the algae that was growing wasn‚Äôt just algae, it was Cyanobacteria. I had never seen it before, so it‚Äôs new to me. I removed what I could from the substrate (it found itself on some food I had thrown in to ‚Äúfeed‚Äù the cycle), the roots of some red root floaters, and one of my lava rocks). 

Is my cycle screwed? I‚Äôm finding conflicting information about what exactly this means for my cycle. I‚Äôll be performing a black out for the next few days.",04 May 2024 23:59:44

**water parameters**: 

* both phosphate and nitrate are extremely low (almost undetectable). 
* Hardness was also very low, so I added some seachem equilibrium and alkaline buffer. 

**Lighting**: a basic LED tank light. 8 hours per day. 

**filtration**: a well established HOB, the cartridge is a bit old. I assumed this was a good thing?

**Plants**: moderately planted. 

**fish**: low bioload. 2 dwarf rasboras and 3 small amano shrimp. weekly feeding.

Part of the problem is that I had been using deionized water, which has basically no nutrients in it at all. I naively assumed that this would limit the growth of algae, but obviously it hasn't. 

I've seen contradictory information about whether I should add nitrate and phosphate. Some sources say this will simply feed the algae, while other sources claim that a lack of nitrate is the probable cause.

And it states that the major concern is that the dog eats the blue green algae directly. My dog is a picky eater and he never eats raccoon poop or anything so are the risks lower for him?

I chimed in that when I had been much younger, I was attracted to a weird regimen of gelatin treats like Jello, the odd papaya powder pill, the vitamin niacin and something else, probably chewable vitamin c. This prompted a third person to ask what the big deal was about gelatine, and my reply was approximately that shark collagen was the naz, being from an animal that went back to the Jurassic, over 500,000,000 years ago, and who theoretically was more undifferentiated, so accessible to either existing vestigial defense-systems, or some such cooperation, as if one cares why exactly the Amazon rainforest does what it does, versus stem cells from infant cadavers.

What's the difference between gelatin and collagen? Let alone, after digesting it with something like papain? Nyeh? Does one need to go to cadavers if all one is after is a smidgin of building block?

By Paul McClure
October 09, 2023

Researchers have used plasma technology to transform a species of blue-green microalgae into a bioactive coating with incredible wound-healing properties. They say the novel coating can be applied to dressings and medical devices to protect patients from infection, speed up healing and reduce inflammation.

Plasma is formed from gas so superheated that the electrons are ripped away from the atoms, resulting in a soup of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. An atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) provides a plasma discharge at ambient pressure using a noble gas/molecular gas mixture passed through a powerful electric arc discharge.

Researchers at Flinders University, South Australia, have used an argon APPJ to convert blue-green microalgae into an ultrathin bioactive coating that can be added to medical dressings to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation and promote wound healing.

‚ÄúWe are using the plasma coating technology to turn any type of biomass ‚Äì in this case Spirulina maxima ‚Äì into a sustainable high-end coating,‚Äù said Vi Khanh Truong, one of the study‚Äôs corresponding authors. ‚ÄúWith our technology, we can transform biomass into coatings on wound dressing.‚Äù

Extract of S. maxima, a species of blue-green microalgae, is often used as a dietary supplement. The unicellular organism possesses a simple reproductive system that generates a biomass containing bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant and antibacterial properties that can assist with wound healing.

However, the thick cell walls of the microalgae pose a significant obstacle to extracting these valuable compounds. That‚Äôs where APPJ comes in. The researchers used the technology to selectively break down the microalgae‚Äôs thick walls, which resulted in a significant transformation. S. maxima lost its native structure, completely disintegrated, and subsequently reformed into ultrathin films.

A schematic depicting the one-step argon APPJ process to transform S. maxima biomass into an ultrathin bioactive coating and its applicationPham et al.
The antibacterial activity of the argon APPJ-treated S. maxima was assessed and found to be highly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with 93% and 73% cell death, respectively, and inhibited biofilm formation. Bacteria inside biofilm are much more resistant to antibiotics.

In addition to being biocompatible, the S. maxima coating exhibited anti-inflammatory properties. And a wound created by the researchers using wound scratch assay was completely closed in two days when the coating was used.

The researchers say this novel technique holds promise as a wound treatment, including the treatment of chronic wounds, particularly given the rise in antibiotic resistance.

‚ÄúThis new, plasma-facilitated downstream processing can improve extraction and purification of useful compounds from biomass without the need for harmful solvents and a lot of energy input,‚Äù said Krasimir Vasilev, the other corresponding author of the study. ‚ÄúWe are now exploiting avenues for commercialization of this unique technology. Currently, there is no commercial wound dressings that simultaneously fight and protect from infection, favorably modulate inflammation and stimulate healing.‚Äù

The study was published in the journal Small.

I posted in here a few months ago with questions about my school‚Äôs betta but I‚Äôm back with more. Anyways, I work at a school and we have a Betta named Uncle Rico. Uncle Rico was my personal betta fish until I moved and no longer had the space for his tank in my house. Fortunately, I work at a high school and everyone was really excited to meet him! He is a well loved fish, but only myself, one specific student, and another teacher are allowed to feed him (the previous beta at the school was seriously over fed by students- very sad.) ANYWAYS the tank Uncle Rico moved into happened to have something in it with blue green algae on it. I did not know this. He relocated to this new and improved tank and now there is so much algae growing I have to clean the thing every 5 days or it gets coated in the nasty slimy stuff. Also very annoying because it really clogs the filter. 
How do I get rid of the algae?? I know it‚Äôs not bad for him, it‚Äôs just excessive.

My student is taking him home for winter break so fishy will be good, but I‚Äôd like to solve this algae issue.

I am at a lake in Alberta and there was a blue green algae bloom in random areas of the lake 3 days ago. It seems to be gone now, but some of it washed up on the sandy beach. I have raked up and removed most of it, but not all as that would be impossible without removing all of the sand. Also it has rained since, don't know if that makes a difference. When is the beach safe for the kids to play on again? I have been googling for an hour but have been unable to find the answer to this question. Does the algae die once it is out of the water? Does it remain toxic? Can I spray some white vinegar or peroxide or something on it to help make the beach safe to play on again?",10 Aug 2023 13:57:05

I hope you can help me with your experience. I'm facing a blue-green algae issue in my 200-liter aquarium (approximately 53 US gallons) and have already taken several measures to get rid of them, unfortunately without success so far. Here are my attempts:

1. BlueExit treatment
2. Increasing plant density with new plants
3. Using ""Phorax"" as a phosphate remover
4. Changing all filter sponges
5. Large water change (70%) followed by weekly changes between 10-15%
6. Using a silicate remover
7. Manual removal of every algae I find
I have attached pictures of my efforts and the current state of my aquarium. If anyone has any ideas or advice, I would be infinitely grateful!

Being a big environmentalist myself, I'm just intrigued that they're able to make a TV drama out of such an important issue, especially since it is viewed as a dry topic to most people.

- Nicht die alleinige Schuld der Orga. Teilnehmer m√ºssen sich selbst √ºber die Gefahren vor Ort informieren.
- In den Regionen, wo Red Tide auftreten kann, soll man von Mai bis Oktober keine Muscheln essen.
- Die Empfehlung gilt unabh√§ngig davon, ob zu dem Zeitpunkt tats√§chlich Red Tide ist, denn:
1. Muscheln lagern die Toxine ein.
2. Nur weil zum Zeitpunkt der Aussetzung keine Red Tide ist, kann man nicht ausschlie√üen, dass sie ein paar Tage danach auftritt.
- Da nicht sichergestellt ist, dass man als Teilnehmer rechtzeitig √ºber Red Tide erf√§hrt, wollte Hannah gar keine Muscheln essen.
- Orga h√§tte dies mitteilen k√∂nnen. Aber wenn man sich als Teilnehmer nicht sicher ist, soll man's nicht essen.
- Red Tide ist nicht vergleichbar mit dem Todesapfel aus Panama. Red Tide kann bei Menschen nach Muschelverzehr zu Magen-Darm f√ºhren, ist aber nicht t√∂dlich.",26 Dec 2023 09:34:04
507,https://www.reddit.com/r/7vsWild/comments/18o6xfl/aufkl√§rung_red_tide/,Aufkl√§rung Red Tide,"Ich habe das Gef√ºhl dass sich viele Mysterien um Red Tide oder die Algenbl√ºte und ihre Gefahren ranken deswegen habe ich mal ein bisschen recherchiert und meine Erkenntnisse aufgearbeitet: 

Red Tide ist ein Ph√§nomen bei dem sich Algen oder Cyanobakterien massenweise vermehren aufgrund einer √úberd√ºngung des Wassers. Durch die Algen kann sich das Wasser rot verf√§rben, daher der Name. 

Die Algen oder Cyanobakterien produzieren h√§ufig toxische Substanzen wie Saxitoxine, die ins Wasser abgegeben werden und f√ºr Seelebewesen und Badende gef√§hrlich sein k√∂nnen. Dar√ºber hinaus reichern sie sich in Muscheln an, die sich √ºber das filtern von Wasser ern√§hren und die Toxine so aufnehmen. Ab einer Konzentration von 80 ¬µg/100g Saxitoxine in Muscheln gelten sie als gesundheitssch√§dlich. Die Toxine sind √ºbrigens hitzebest√§ndig, k√∂nnen also durch kochen oder braten nicht eliminiert werden.

Die mit Saxitoxin aus Muscheln in Verbindung stehende Kondition hei√üt paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). ""Die Symptome treten in der Regel innerhalb von zehn bis 30 Minuten nach der Einnahme auf und k√∂nnen √úbelkeit, Erbrechen, Durchfall, Bauchschmerzen und Kribbeln oder Brennen von Lippen, Zahnfleisch, Zunge, Gesicht, Hals, Armen, Beinen und Zehen umfassen, Kurzatmigkeit, Mundtrockenheit, Erstickungsgef√ºhl, verwirrte oder undeutliche Sprache und Koordinationsverlust sind ebenfalls m√∂glich. (...) PSP kann in extremen F√§llen t√∂dlich sein, insbesondere bei immungeschw√§chten Personen; Kinder sind bekannterma√üen anf√§lliger.."" ([Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralytic_shellfish_poisoning)) 

Wie giftig ist also eine einzelne Muschel? Ist die Panik von Knossi und Sascha gerechtfertigt? Nach meiner kurzen Recherche sage ich: Nein. Ich zitiere mal aus einem [Bericht](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6045a3.htm#tab) √ºber einen Fall von Muschelvergiftungen in Alaska, 2011: 

""Am 3. Juni 2011 erwachte ein 52-j√§hriger Mann aus Metlakatla auf der Annette-Insel im S√ºdosten Alaskas aus einem Mittagsschlaf mit Taubheitsgef√ºhlen im Mundbereich, Kribbeln in den H√§nden und leichter Dyspnoe. Er wurde in die Annette Island Service Unit, das Gesundheitszentrum der Gemeinde, gebracht, wo sich ein Arzt nach dem j√ºngsten Verzehr von Meeresfr√ºchten erkundigte. Nachdem der Mann berichtet hatte, dass er kurz vor seinem Mittagsschlaf eine Mahlzeit mit ged√ºnsteten Herzmuscheln gegessen hatte, diagnostizierte der Arzt PSP. Der Mann wurde nach Ketchikan transportiert, wo er geschw√§cht und nicht mehr in der Lage war, sich ohne Hilfe im Bett aufzusetzen, und auf die Intensivstation eingeliefert wurde.""

Es gab damals noch 20 weitere Patienten, die nach Verzehr eines Muschelgerichts √§hnliche Symptome hatten. 

""Alle 21 Patienten berichteten √ºber Par√§sthesien (Taubheitsgef√ºhle) (...) Vier der 21 Patienten wurden ins Krankenhaus eingeliefert  keiner starb. Von den 21 Patienten hatten 15  Herzmuscheln verzehrt, vier  Miesmuscheln, einer Butter- und Herzmuscheln und einer Muscheln, deren Verzehr nicht n√§her spezifiziert wurde.""

Trotz Konzentrationen von bis zu 5000¬µg/100g und dem Verzehr eines ganzen Gerichtes starb keiner der Patienten, eine einzelne Muschel sollte also mehr oder weniger unbedenklich sein. Trotzdem h√§tte die Orga von Anfang an vom Verzehr von Muscheln abraten sollen, und √ºber m√∂gliche Symptome aufkl√§ren m√ºssen.

Korrigiert mich, wenn ihr etwas anders verstanden habt. 

- Die Location ist im Red Tide Gefahrengebiet. Das hei√üt, wenn Red Tide ist, muss man da sehr aufpassen. Zum Zeitpunkt der Produktion war aber keine Red Tide. Das hat Fritz ganz klar so gesagt und passt auch zu dem was man Online dazu findet. 

- Im Bus auf dem Weg zur Location googelt Reeze das Thema und st√∂√üt auf eine Karte auf der die Region Fett rot als Gefahrengebiet markiert ist. Er spricht die Orga drauf, die ihm keine klare Antwort geben. Ob aus Unwissenheit oder sonstigen Gr√ºnden wissen wir nicht. 

- Seitdem ist das Thema Red Tide in den K√∂pfen der Teilnehmer und sie kriegen bis zur Aussetzung keine klare Aussage zu dem Thema. 

- Sascha & Knossi sind sich unsicher, ob sie die Muscheln essen k√∂nnen. Als das Team kommt, um die SD Karte zu holen, sprechen sie sie auf das Thema an. Das Team kann Ihnen keine klare Antwort geben, sagt aber, dass sie die Muscheln ruhig Essen sollen. ETA: Konsenz scheint zu sein, dass Sasha nicht gesagt hat, dass die Orga das Go zum Essen gegeben haben sondern nur ein ""Kein Kommentar"", was von den Beiden als ja interpretiert wurde. 

- S&K Essen die Muscheln. Werden dann aber panisch, weil ihnen die Aussagen zu unklar sind. Sie nehmen Kontakt zur Orga auf. Wie genau ist unsicher, vermutlich √ºbers Telefon oder den Notfallsender, der wohl auch SMS schicken kann. 

- Laut Sascha rastet Knossi wohl sehr aus. Er f√ºrchtet um sein Leben und droht mit Abbruch, wenn das ganze nicht gekl√§rt wird. 

- Ein ""Ranger"" kommt zu den beiden und sagt Ihnen, dass sie keine Muscheln mehr essen sollen. Wieso das die Ansage ist, obwohl keine Red Tide ist, wissen wir nicht. Vielleicht ist die Orga selbst verunsichert. Vielleicht gibt es noch andere Gr√ºnde die Muscheln nicht zu essen. ETA: [In diesem Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/7vsWild/s/OsfdoQjSCA) wird gezeigt, dass die Regierung zum Zeitpunkt des Drehs vom Essen von Muscheln in dem Gebiet abr√§t. Es werden auf der Homepage allgemein m√∂gliche Gr√ºnde f√ºr diese Bewertung genannt (z.B. Menschen gemachtes Schmutzwasser), aber *nicht* die Red Tide. 

- Knossi verlangt, dass auch die anderen Teilnehmer die gleiche Information bekommen. 

- Best√§tigt wissen wir nur von Team Edeltalk, dass der Ranger danach auch Kontakt zu ihnen auf genommen hat, da PP es in seiner Reaction gesagt hat. Aber es liegt nahe, dass es den anderen Teams √§hnlich ging.",21 Dec 2023 20:08:55

531,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/1anj2x1/red_tide_ending/,Red Tide ending,"Here's my take on what would have made Red Tide a truly top tier season if the last episode changed.

Pretend the last episode doesn't exist, and lets go back to the beginning of Gaslight. Keep all the gaslighting stuff with the Gardner family/Ursula obvi and have it play out the way it did. But instead of having Karen & Mickey's death scenes in this episode, push them (keep them how they are) to the 6th/last episode. 

The showdown between Gardeners & Austin/Belle should instead be a showdown between Karen/Mickey & Austin/Belle with Karen killing Belle with vengeance and Mickey killing Austin in self defense. 

Alma kills Ursula because Ursula is too controlling and she sees her becoming more of a parental figure which she doesn't want because she's over parents. 

While attempting to leave town, Harry & Alma are attacked by the pale creatires, led by Doris. In a climactic showdown, it becomes a ""only one of us can live situation"", and Harry sacrifices himsef as he is riddled with guilt over the whole situation. Alma & Harry say goodbye and Alma escapes, running away and to the cops/city council.

Sunrise approaches and we meet up with Karen & Mickey now, who are also attemption to leave, but Mickey insists they feed first so they have enough strength for when they're living outside of Provincetown. Like Gaslight, Karen hates this and he convinces her to make her painting before they feed. Karen agrees, but with an alterior motive.

This is when Karen kills Mickey, makes her masterpiece, then kills herself, becoming the red tide. 

The chemist relocates by herself, and the scenes with Alma from ""Winter Kills"" can be the same I guess, just majorly condensed.

In the last shot, in a new town ravaged by pales , Karen's painting - a now famous piece of art - hangs in the background as we cut to black.",10 Feb 2024 10:41:57

I know tastes are different, but I'd still like to know what you all thought was so good about Red Tide?

Someone who has seen the previous 8 seasons and got to know and love AHS can't seriously watch Red Tide without being completely disappointed afterwards? On its own, the plot of the series may be okay, but compared to the previous seasons, the plot was predictable, boring and not very innovative. It was simply bad. 

I remember waiting episode after episode for the big plot twist, but it never came. What came next was the shit with the aliens but unfortunately no more interesting story. From an objective point of view, every single season that came before had more content, more interesting characters and a much more complex story. From this point of view, I personally can't understand how there are people who rate the season as the best season or generally think that the season was good. If delicate were already over, both seasons would have the same lack of plot.

Writing credits: Music: Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Lyrics: Neil Peart

Contemporaneous band member quote: ""I wanted to get a lot of tension in that solo because the song is quite intense. There's a kind of disturbing feeling about that solo, which I think ties it all together well. The song is angry. Neil is basically a very ecology-minded person, and he wrote this song dealing with the destruction of our environment. So I wanted the music, and especially my solo, to reflect that anger."" -**Alex** to Bill Milkowski of *Guitar World Magazine* (March 1990)

[Rush Official YouTube Channel link](https://youtu.be/c_fvqxrXWAk?si=f4dkrYd-qrZTuCZ2)

This song was never performed live. Some lyrics were inspired by *The Masque of the Red Death* by Edgar Allen Poe (1842).

591,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmericanHorrorStory/comments/16e8f0c/watched_red_tide_for_the_first_time/,Watched Red Tide for the first time.,"It had like five solid episodes, especially episode five, like a true horror movie. Great atmosphere, fantastic cast (Lily, Frances, Finn, Sarah and more all put in the work). Hell even the child actor was decent.

But then the finale happened and this season's top tier ranking was snatched away. Some of the finale was actually decent with Finn's character getting what was coming to him but Doris' justice??? (Couldn't have she been at least killed with the other pale men??)... Alma really should have died, at the very least, Ryan killed innocent kids in his show before, this one was the very worst of them all lol. The chemist also kinda sucked as far as ""unexplained motivations"" go. I don't mind a dark ending -- though I do usually prefer a good one, but at least some justice would have been nice. So many questions about that town, also anything once they went to Hollywood has been kinda shit lmao. 

Side point, I have barely watched AHStories (I watched Dollhouse which was really good, that mediocre bella thorne episode and also imo the kinda overrated baal episode which was also mediocre lol), but anything from Hollywood on has pretty much felt like that series?? like ahs had weird endings before but nothing flopped this hard, i loved roanoke and was kinda annoyed with the ending but even that ending wasn't as bad.

So overall I'm so conflicted, it was a good season with a terrible ending. weird",09 Sep 2023 11:22:56

A semi challenging island hopping map where currents are scarce and bad water is an ever creeping threat. I would love other to play and post pictures of your settlement. Feedback is welcome.

Come join us and see what has made Clambake a bucket-list tournament for over three decades. Two days of games in Open, Women's, and Mixed divisions on lined fields, including all the usual tournament amenities, plus extras like individual and team trophies for the division champs.

But we can play Ultimate any time - what separates Clambake from the rest is The Party! The Clambake party is at an amazing venue with camping for all, and we serve a massive Maine Clambake dinner with mussels, steamers, and corn on the cob cooked over open fires; plus steak, chicken, veggie burgers, pasta salads, and whatever dessert a team decides to spring on us!

We have incredible live music playing from the moment you arrive until the outdoor stage shut down at 11 pm - but that's when things really get going! We have an amazing band playing late night in the beautiful old barn, a massive bonfire, huge silent disco, lawn games - and the shenanigans in the beer tent are legendary...

Clambake is a fundraiser for Maine Special Olympics, and to celebrate the 35th we'll raise $35,000 this year, adding to the over $600,000 we've raised since 1989!

We would love to have you join the fun - if you're interested, please fill out the short registration form [here](https://forms.gle/Nf9zd1HpzH1vKUT67)

We started listening to AYIOO then she pointed out to me that Roxanne by The Police and Red Tide sound extremely similar. We put them both on and couldnt stop laughing at the discovery. Anybody have any thoughts on this or know if this is already a known thing? haha

I‚Äôve been in Florida when this happens and I‚Äôve gotten headaches and respiratory symptoms because the algae comes right up onto the beaches and effects the air quality in the waterfront area. Is this also the case right now in San Diego/Socal? Or is this happening offshore at a distance? How safe is it to go near the water? I was hoping to spend some time at the beach.

Any info would be helpful. Thanks.

**June 13th 1964, Moscow, USSR**

'Da.' Khrushchev hung up the phone with Chairman Mao. With the first of the Zimniy-Volk medium Mechs rolling out of the factories they'd be able to lend some to support China's liberation of Taiwan. They'd had the prototypes for a couple of years, but the necessity of secrecy meant they never went into full production. With the return of the Nazis secrecy was no longer a concern.

The Soviets had known about the extraterrestrials ever since 1908. But it wasn't until they'd infiltrated the American Mech program in '55 that they made any progress in deciphering the scraps of Alien tech that had been salvaged. The Americans had gotten lucky with their 'Roswell', that ship had been far less damaged than the one that crashed in Tunguska. It put them ahead in weapons development, but they hadn't cracked the secret of the aliens hull alloy yet. But Khrushchev's scientists had cracked that secret just last year. Which meant the Zimniy Volks would be far more resistant than American Mechs of the same weight. And the newly designed Medved heavy Mech would be a terror on the battlefield.

The Medveds wouldn't be ready in any significant numbers until fall at the earliest, but Khrushchev needed to take action now for two reasons. While the Americans were tied up in South America their European allies were thus far untroubled, they couldn't be allowed to catch up in the arms race while the USSR did nothing. Secondly there had been growing grumbles in the Politburo about his ability to lead ever since the Cuban fiasco.

Staring at the map before laid out before him, Khrushchev's eyes drifted to Alaska. Nyet, not until the Medveds were ready. His eyes then drifted to the other end... Berlin though, now there was a possibility.

He picked up his phone and dialed his Secretary, ""Get Marshal Malinovsky here and tell him to bring his planning staff with him.""

**June 13th 1964, Beijing, People's Republic of China**

Chairman Mao looked at the assembled Generals. ""The Soviets are sending us fifteen of their Zimniy-Volk medium Mechs, five of these should be used for study to help sur the development of our own Mechs."" Heads around the table nodded, true the Soviets and the Americans had beat them to these new technologies but they were quick studies, soon the world would know the glory and the power that is the Peoples Republic of China.

At the far end General Wei spoke up, ""And what of the other ten?""

Chairman Mao smiled, his hand pointing to a small island off the coast. ""First we test them as we unify China once more."" His hand drifted north to a cluster of three islands, ""Then we get revenge for Nanjing.""

**June 24th 1964, Taiwan**

Colonel Chen set down the binoculars, ""Let them get a little further in range. Primary targets are the cargo ships in the center."" The Peoples Republic of China had come a knocking. While there were just too many ships for his defense battery to stop them all before they could make landfall he could definitely take out some juicy targets. Like the two cargo ships they had so obligingly loaded all their Mechs on. 

Chen brought the binoculars to his eyes once more, ""Fire!"" Behind him four 16 in cannons spoke with deafening booms lofting their shells into the air. One shell landed short, a geyser of water marking where it fell, the other three were direct hits. The ship on the right had two holes punched straight down from the bow to the keel. It sank almost immediately. The left ship was taking on water and would not make it to shore, but Chen could see one enterprising soldier hop into a Mech and aim at the defense batteries. 

Laser fire burned through the concrete bunkers and ignited the magazines. The blast threw Chen through the air. He landed hard, breaking his left arm. Chen grimaced in pain and struggled to take in air, most likely a couple of ribs broken as well. When his head cleared and his vision returned he saw that would be the last of the hell weapons to fire, the second ship had listed hard to starboard and the Mechs had toppled overboard into the sea. As the medic reached him Chen thought, the battle for Taiwan would be bloody but at least it would be conventional.

Chen was right, it was bloody. Slowed down by razor wire and land mines the first wave of invaders were decimated by machine gun nests. The invaders would loose thousands that day, but they had the numbers and were determined in their assault. Like the tide they could not be stopped, Colonel Chen called for retreat three hours after the battle had begun.

**One hour later aboard the Peoples Republic of China Ship Liu Buchan**

Admiral Zhou, the first battle had been a disaster, thousands dead. All of the Mechs lost. Chairman Mao would be furious, Zhou took a long look at the picture of his wife and son on his desk then looked at the pistol.

Admiral Zhou would be the senior most casualty of the first battle of Taiwan.

**June 20th 1964, Chernobyl, USSR**

Viktor Severov was a war orphan, both his parents killed in the Battle of Stalingrad. A ward of the state he'd been picked on most of his life. He thought joining the Army would fix that, but the officers were just bullies with ribbons pinned to their chests. But now as he got his first look at the Zimniy-Volk, a 12 meter tall machine of death and destruction he knew powerlessness was a thing of the past. Today was his first day of training to be a Mech pilot, a month from now he'd be in Berlin taking revenge on the people who made him an orphan.
