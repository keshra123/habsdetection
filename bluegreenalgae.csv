This is in response to a water sample taken on March 4, 2024. The public should exercise caution in and around Dowling Lake-North . Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Wash your skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with algae or discolored or smelly. Keep pets away from the Waters where there are algae blooms are not safe for animals. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water when algae blooms are present. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish well. Do not eat shellfish in waters with algae. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals.

Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Photo courtesy of Finn Ryan of yaharaproject.org Blue-green algae blooms on large, shallow and nutrient-rich lakes may be related to ongoing drought conditions in Wisconsin this summer. The state has already received at least 93 algal bloom reports so far this year compared to 69 reports at the end of July last year. That’s according to figures provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The agency said the increase in reports this year is likely due to sightings of pollen and filamentous green algae that looks like long green hairs growing in the water. The latter can form floating green mats that turn brown and become smelly as they break down. About half the blooms reported so far — 48 — have been identified as cyanobacterial blooms. Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, has the ability to produce toxins that can make people or their pets sick. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email Name This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Gina LaLiberte, the agency’s harmful algal bloom coordinator, said it’s possible drainage lakes may see more drought-related effects on water quality because rivers typically flow into them. She said conditions may begin to stagnate in those lakes if there’s not as much water moving through them due to a lack of rain. “The water gets really warm, the nutrients aren’t moving through, so that’s where you might be seeing more issues with cyanobacterial blooms,” LaLiberte said. LaLiberte said she’s received reports and photos confirming blue-green algae blooms on large and shallow drainage lakes like Lake Winnebago and Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Blue-green algae issues have surfaced over the years on Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Photo courtesy of Rhonda Cain-Carrell Despite the presence of blue-green algae, Rick Georgeson who lives and sails on Lake Petenwell said water conditions appear much better than years past. He attributes improvements in water quality to the efforts of producer-led groups that have formed in the Wisconsin River watershed. “These farmers are making some huge changes in the way they farm,” Georgeson said. “Cover crop and no till planting seems to be making a huge difference in what we’ve seen.” Satellite data has also detected cyanobacterial blooms on Lakes Petenwell and Castle Rock, as well as the Chetek Chain of Lakes in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chetek Lakes Protection Association represents around 500 property owners on the chain’s six lakes, which see around 40,000 visitors each summer. That’s according to Jamey Lideen, president of the association. Lideen said he’s unaware of any blue-green algae blooms and hasn’t observed any changes under drought conditions this year. Although, he said blooms often form in shallow bays on the lakes with low water flows after the July 4th holiday. “It’s very typical later in the summer that people in these small bays smell the decaying algae or see a buildup of it in those areas,” Lideen said, noting decaying duckweed is often mistaken for blue-green algae. LaLiberte said she hasn’t received any bloom reports from the Chetek Chain of Lakes, but state health officials received a question from a resident about the safety of water on the chain’s Prairie Lake. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has received and investigated at least 14 reports of illnesses in animals and humans that were suspected to stem from blue-green algae exposure. Of those, only three were potentially related to blue-green algae. “Symptoms associated with these cases have included things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash,” Jordan Murray, harmful algal bloom epidemiologist for DHS, said. “We had one dog illness so far, and symptoms with the dog included things like lethargy, seizure-like symptoms and vomiting as well.” A large cyanobacteria bloom on Lake Monona in Madison on June 29, 2019. Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Finn Ryan/ yaharaproject.org State health officials typically receive an average of 25 reports each year when blooms are most likely to form between May through September. “With the sort of drought conditions that we’ve been experiencing, hot weather, lack of rain creates these prime conditions for blooms to grow and to be produced,” Murray said. “With that being said, it’s possible that we get more illness reports throughout the end of the month and then into August as well.” Kids are especially susceptible to exposure. Murray said people can keep their kids and pets safe by steering clear of water that resembles green paint or pea soup. She also advised parents to remind their children not to swallow water while swimming. Ingesting water is the primary way that people can get sick, but people can also come into contact with blue-green algae toxins on their skin or by breathing in water droplets. For animals, health officials recommend giving their dogs breaks from swimming and rinsing them off after any potential exposure. As for the Great Lakes, the DNR’s LaLiberte said there have been no reports of blooms on the open waters of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior. Although mats of blue-green algae were found attached to the sediment of Barker’s Island beach in Superior on July 12 and 13. A short-lived blue-green algae bloom was spotted on Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, at the Barker’s Island beach area in Superior. Photo courtesy of Hannah Ramage with the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve Kait Reinl, a researcher at the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, said the mats contained two species of blue-green algae that have the potential to produce toxins. “But we don’t have any evidence that any toxins were actually being produced,” Reinl said. Toxic blue-green algae was found for the first time two years ago in the inlet of Lake Superior. It was a concerning discovery in the progression of blooms observed on the lake. The first documented blue-green algae bloom on Lake Superior formed in 2012 after massive flooding in the region. That was followed by another large bloom in 2018 that stretched about 50 miles along the lake’s shore. Researchers are keeping a close eye on blooms as climate change drives temperatures higher, warms lakes and causes more extreme weather events that set the stage for harmful algal blooms. State regulators and researchers urge people to report any blooms or illnesses .

The Florida Department of Health issued a cautionary warning heading into this weekend for the canals by Southeast 23rd Street and Southeast 11 th Place after testing found the conditions ripe for a bloom that creates a gooey, green, scum. However, the agency reminded residents that winds and tides tend to push the components of blue-green algae around, so people in that region should be watchful for the potentially toxic bloom. Blooms in February are uncommon. They usually occur in late summer or early fall. Blue-green algae is a bacteria, not an algae. Called cyanobacteria, it usually develops in freshwater but can also grow in brackish or marine environments, which can produce toxins that significantly impact water quality, aquatic life, and human health. In humans, blue-green algae most often cause eye or skin irritation. In animals, a particularly potent bloom has been known to kill pets such as dogs, so if Fido gets wet where the bacteria is present wash the dog with an animal-safe detergent as soon as possible. Cats, even livestock, also should not be exposed to algal bloom-impacted water. Blooms form in warm, slow-moving waters that are rich in nutrients, often phosphate and nitrogen from the overuse of lawn fertilizer by homeowners. The waters around Cape Coral right now are the average of 67 degrees or so for this time of year, but temperatures in the shallow canals could be warmer as what little grip winter has on South Florida tends to begin to fade this month. A cautionary warning is issued when there are low levels of the bacteria. But large concentrations can turn the water into a variety of colors and cause foam or scum to appear on the surface, which can emit a nasty odor as the bloom dies off and starts to rot. Two weeks ago, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a $30 million effort to reduce instances of blue-green algae in the Caloosahatchee River, although it will be some time before those efforts begin.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Upper Castaic Lake closed today due to an elevated danger algal bloom advisory. The Department of Water Resources urges people to avoid physical contact with water at Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County until further notice due to the presence of toxic blue-green algae. People should also avoid eating fish or shellfish from the lake. Boating and water-contact recreation and sporting activities, including shoreline fishing, are not considered safe at Upper Castaic Lake due to potential adverse health effects. Castaic Lake State Recreation Area remains open to land-based recreation. Castaic Lagoon, also known as lower Castaic Lake, has no algal bloom advisory and is open to non-motorized boating. For latest conditions and d anger advisory information, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website . Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats, and scum, form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Take care that pets and livestock do not drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algal blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat mussels or other bivalves collected from these areas. No fish should be consumed under a danger advisory. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

Here is what can happen if you or your pet is exposed to it. Blue-green algae can cause organ damage in humans and death in pets. (Greg Lovett/Palm Beach Post/TNS) Read more Greg Lovett / MCT by Michelle Myers and Frank Kummer Published July 26, 2023, 3:08 p.m. ET If you are by a body of water with green lines or dots, and the smell aggravates your nose, you might be in the presence of blue-green algae. JUMP TO SECTION What causes blue-green algae in lakes? Is blue green algae dangerous? What does blue-green algae do to humans? How to identify blue-green algae Signs of blue-green algae poisoning in dogs What if I spot or suspect a harmful algal bloom? Isn’t blue-green algae sold as a dietary supplement? In July, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection found blue-green algae at Timber Creek Pond in Gloucester Township, rendering the area high-risk for people and animals’ health. Blue-green algae is the common name for a type of cyanobacteria that can produce harmful toxins, causing organ failure in humans and death in pets. In 2019, four dogs died in North Carolina and Georgia after swimming in a pond loaded with it. This summer, cyanobacteria has caused New Jersey’s Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to put two bodies of water under red alert, and seven others in orange. What does that mean and how will it impact you? Here is what to know about the blue-green algae in New Jersey. What causes blue-green algae in lakes? Blue-green algae naturally exist in freshwater ecosystems. Your local lake, estuary, pond, or ocean are common homes to cyanobacteria. It seeks sunlight and nutrients to stay alive, creating a thick layer that floats to the surface, called blooms. Not all blooms are cyanobacteria. Some are common green algae, which are not toxic. Despite being a common occurrence between late summer and early fall, physical and chemical variables are causing an increase in cases of blue-green algae this season. Advertisement Changes in water temperature or flow, PH fluctuations, and an increase in water nutrients — from lawn and farm fertilizers — are causing cyanobacteria to multiply faster, according to the United States Environmental Agency (EPA). This endangers the water stream ecosystem by blocking marine life from accessing sunlight and can expose humans to dangerous bacteria. Is blue green algae dangerous? The danger falls in the toxins present in the bloom . According to the EPA, not all cyanobacteria produce toxins, but when they are found, their effect can be harmful to people’s health. In 2020, the DEP came up with a tier system that measures these toxins to determine whether or not a body of water presents a danger to living beings. Advertisement Here are what all the alert statuses mean: Blue-green algae bloom status If your local waterbody is under any of these alerts, do not drink water or eat fish from it. 🔵 Watch : Blue-green algae were spotted during a field inspection, but the confirmed cell count remains between 20,000 to 80,000. Swimming and non-contact boating are still permitted, but folks should proceed with caution. 🟠 Advisory : Lab testing has proved the presence of cyanotoxins or the confirmed cell counts exceeded 80,000. At this stage, beaches will close, but the waterbody remains open. Swimming is not recommended, and you should be careful of coming in contact with the water if boating. 🔴 Warning : Toxin levels are high. Microcystin levels reached between 20 to 2,000 cell counts. Beaches are closed, water bodies are open, but don’t go swimming or boating. ⚫ Danger : Microcystins levels are very high, reaching over 2,000 cells.  This alert can lead to the waterbody fully or partially closing. Depending on the conditions, access to the shoreline might become restricted. Source: state.nj.us Timber Creek Pond, for instance, entered warning status on July 13, so the county’s Health Department placed signs to warn both folk and pets to keep out of the water. What does blue-green algae do to humans? The most common cyanotoxins in blue-green algae are Microcystins, Cylindrospermopsin, Anatoxins, and Saxitoxins. Drinking water, swimming, eating fish, or simply breathing by a waterbody with cyanotoxins can seriously harm you. At best, you will experience mild skin rashes, hay fever symptoms (runny nose, itchy eyes, cough), difficulty breathing, and gastrointestinal problems. At worst, it can cause organ failure, and in rare cases, death. Advertisement Microcystins: Affect the liver, kidneys, and reproductive system. Coming in contact with this cyanotoxin causes stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sore throat, dry cough, blistering around the mouth, and pneumonia. Cylindrospermopsin: Damages both the liver and kidneys. Symptoms include headaches, fever, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Anatoxins: Affect the central nervous system, taking a toll on your brain and spinal cord. As a result, you may experience incoherent speech, salivation, drowsiness, numbness or tingling, burning sensations, and respiratory paralysis. Saxitoxins: In high levels, it can cause severe poisoning, headaches, muscle weakness, vertigo, and paralysis. If you accidentally swallow water from a blue-green algae stream, call your doctor immediately, especially if you began to develop symptoms . The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) also recommends calling the poison control hotline, at 1-800-222-1222. In case your skin comes in contact, take a shower or rinse it with clean water. Try to stay as far away from blue-green algae as possible. You might not plan on touching or drinking it, but that doesn’t prevent your body from breathing in the toxins. How to identify blue-green algae The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection has identified some key things to look for if you think you may be in contact with blue-green algae. If the water stinks, looks like a layer of bluish‐green or white paint was poured on the surface of it, has a pea soup look, green streaks parallel to the shoreline, or globs of any size, it’s probably blue-green algae . When in doubt, DEP recommends not swimming, fishing, or drinking from the stream of water. Signs of blue-green algae poisoning in dogs Your four-legged friend can also be affected by these cyanotoxins. Don’t let them go swimming, drink, or eat anything from a waterbody with blue-green algae. If they make their way to the water before you can prevent it, get them out as soon as possible and into the shower. The CDC recommends keeping furry pals under your watchful eye for at least 24 hours after contact. Advertisement Call the veterinarian if your pet throws up, has diarrhea, loses energy or appetite, experiences excessive drooling, stumbles to walk and falls, foams at the mouth, or has convulsions, tremors, or seizures. What if I spot or suspect a harmful algal bloom? It’s best to report it to your state environmental agency. In New Jersey, the DEP is telling residents to report through an online tool or call 1-877-WARNDEP (1-877-927-6337). Isn’t blue-green algae sold as a dietary supplement? Yes, but it’s not the same as what’s plaguing waterways. According to WebMD: “Some blue-green algae products are grown under controlled conditions. Others are grown in a natural setting, where they are more likely to be contaminated by bacteria, liver poisons (microcystins) produced by certain bacteria, and heavy metals. Choose only products that have been tested and found free of these contaminants. You may have been told that blue-green algae are an excellent source of protein. But, in reality, blue-green algae are no better than meat or milk as a protein source and cost about 30 times as much per gram.” Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement About Us About The Inquirer Diversity & Inclusion Advertise Contact Us Licensing & Permissions Photo Reprints Newspapers in Education Jobs & Internships Inquirer Events Acel Moore Workshops Newsroom Staff Help and Feedback News & Info News Sports Sports Betting Entertainment Business Health Food Life Opinion Archives Special Reports Site Map Marketplace Subscribe Inquirer Store Job Listings All Classifieds Death Notices Legal Notices Gift Subscriptions e-Editions The Inquirer The Daily News Subscriber Services Mobile Apps Apple iOS Google Android Twitter Facebook Instagram © 2024 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC Terms of Use / Privacy Policy / Cancellation Policy / California Notice / California residents do not sell my data request",26 Jul 2023 07:00:00,google

(Kansas Department of Health and Environment) By Tori Whalen Published : Apr. 19, 2024 at 7:31 PM CDT Email This Link Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - The Kansas Department of Health and Environment along with the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks has issued public health advisories regarding blue-green algae blooms for residents in Harvey Co. and Shawnee Co. to look out for. Harvey County East Lake, Harvey Co. - Warning Lake Shawnee, Shawnee Co. - Watch A harmful algal bloom is described to appear as foam, scum, or paint floating on the water colored blue, bright green, brown, or red. If the water appears suspicious or you see decaying algae on the shoreline, avoid contact and keep pets away. The KDHE said these toxins can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation of aerosols, and through skin contact. Symptoms can vary depending on how one is exposed. A person can experience vomiting, diarrhea, a rash, fever, sore throat, and a headache. If you or a loved one comes into contact, rinse the area with clean, fresh water. The KDHE would like any suspected harmful algae bloom-related health incidents to be reported HERE. Whether it is human or animal-related situations regardless of the season. A hazard status indicates that a harmful algal bloom is present, and extreme conditions exist. KDHE recommends you take the following precautions: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. It is recommended that either a portion of the lake or the entire lake or zone, be closed to the public. In some cases, the adjacent land should be closed as well. Actual setback distances will be determined on a site-specific basis, if necessary. When partial closures (i.e., beach or cove) are issued, the remaining lake or zone area will carry a warning status. If a lake is under warning status, conditions are considered unsafe for human and pet exposure therefore, contact with the water body should be avoided. KDHE says: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Inhalation of spray or aerosols may be harmful. Lake water is not safe to drink for pets or livestock. Lake water, regardless of blue-green algae status, should never be consumed by humans. Water contact should be avoided. Fish may be eaten if they are rinsed with clean water and only the fillet portion is consumed, while all other parts are discarded. Do not allow pets to eat dried algae. If lake water contacts skin, wash with clean water as soon as possible. Avoid areas of visible algae accumulation. While a watch status indicates that blue-green algae has been detected and the harmful algal bloom is present or likely to bloom. Meaning people have been asked to avoid areas with algae growing and keep pets and livestock away from the body of water. The following KDHE recommendations are: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Water may be unsafe for humans/animals. Avoid areas of algae accumulation and do not let people/pets eat dried algae or drink contaminated water. Swimming, wading, skiing and jet skiing are discouraged near visible blooms. Boating and fishing are safe. However, inhalation of the spray may affect some individuals. Avoid direct contact with water, and wash with clean water after any contact. Clean fish thoroughly with potable water and eat fillet portion only. The advisories will be lifted once the cell densities and toxin concentrations decrease to a level below the watch threshold.

                    By Tom Bayles Published April 27, 2024 at 8:13 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Bayles, Tom / via WLRN The Florida Department of Health in Lee County has issued its fifth health alert this year, four of which have been due to blue-green algae in the Caloosahatchee River. This week the harmful algae was discovered near North Canal Circle in Lochmoor Waterway Estates, on the north side of the Caloosahatchee River about halfway between the Midpoint Bridge and the U.S. 41 Bridge. This is in response to water samples taken on April 22. Large concentrations, called blooms, can change the water color to blue, green, brown, orange, or red. Some cyanobacterial blooms can look like foam, scum, or mats on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. As algae in a cyanobacterial bloom die, the water may smell like something with a naturally unpleasant odor has now started to rot, too. “Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to do so remains poorly understood,” the Lee County Department of Health wrote in a statement. “Since bloom conditions can change at any time, it is important to exercise caution as if the bloom were toxic, even if toxin presence has not yet been confirmed.” Lee County Environmental Lab / WGCU Blue-green algae is often found at the Davis Boat Ramp Different types of blue-green algal bloom species can look different and have different impacts. However, regardless of species, many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins that can make you or your pets sick if swallowed or possibly cause skin and eye irritation. It’s that time of year. Just over half of the sites tested statewide during the last 30 days have tested positive for blue-green algae. The year’s fourth warning for pollutants in or near the Caloosahatchee River — issued about two weeks ago — was due to blue-green algae near the Alva Boat Ramp. The Alva Boat Ramp, and the nearby Davis Boat Ramp, are often places where blue-green algae outbreaks are first noticed. Few become full-blown blooms that spread down the river. At least so far this year. When there are elements of harmful algae in the water people should not swim in it or waterski, and do not drink it or let the contaminated water splash in your mouth. Pets are susceptible to blue-green algae, too, so keep dogs and other animals away. If you or your animal gets soaked by water with blue-green algae in it, wash it off thoroughly. Bayles, Tom The health department previously has issued two more warnings about blue-green algae in the immediate area around the Alva and Davis boat ramps, one to the north of the river in a canal, and the other just to the west of that. In February, the health department issued a blue-green algae alert due to blue-green algae blooms in the Southeast 23rd Street canal and along Southeast 11th Place. Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when the rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors contributing to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions, and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. The first water quality advisory for the year was issued for the Cape Coral Yacht Club, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Ian 18 months ago, due to unacceptably high levels of the enterococcus bacteria. Enterococcus bacteria are used as indicators of fecal contamination in water, suggesting the potential presence of disease-causing organisms. While enterococci are typically not harmful, their presence in water can indicate a health risk for activities such as swimming, as they may be accompanied by pathogens causing illnesses like gastrointestinal issues, skin rashes, and ear infections.

These effects, along with nutrient pollution, might cause algal blooms to become more severe and to occur more often in more waterbodies. Blooms with the potential to harm human health, pets, livestock, or aquatic ecosystems are referred to as harmful algal blooms, or HABs, and they can also have wide ranging economic impacts. In freshwaters, cyanobacteria (microscopic photosynthetic bacteria previously known as blue-green algae due to their color) are the most common HAB producers. Some cyanobacterial HABs, or cyanoHABs, produce toxins that cause illness in humans and other animals. Climate Factors That Affect HABs: Warming water temperature Toxic cyanobacterial bloom HAB forming cyanobacteria thrive in warm, slow-moving water, and typically occur when water temperatures are warmer. As a result, increases in water temperature with climate change are expected to increase the magnitude and duration of cyanoHABs. Warmer water temperatures favor cyanoHABs in several ways, including: CyanoHAB species grow faster than other algae at warmer temperatures CyanoHABs migrate up and down the water column better than other algae. They get nutrients from the cooler, dark, bottom layers and use them to grow in the warmer, upper layers where there is more light. Other algae cannot do this and are shaded by the CyanoHAB species. CyanoHABs absorb sunlight and release heat, making surface waters even warmer, further increasing their advantages. Changes in salinity In some regions, climate change is predicted to reduce freshwater runoff due to drought and increased evaporation. These effects will combine to increase salinity in inland waters. This can impact irrigation, harm crops, contaminate drinking water, and allow the invasion of salt-tolerant and marine algae to inland lakes. In the southwestern and south-central United States, more salt-tolerant algal HABs known as “golden algae” have regularly recurred, expanded into lagoons, and killed fish in freshwater lakes since 2000. In other regions, increased runoff from more intense rainfalls may increase freshwater flows to coastal areas. This freshwater sits on top of saltwater because it is lighter. This can prevent mixing of oxygen rich surface water with deeper layers where the oxygen has been removed by the decomposition of HABs after they die and sink to the bottom layer. These low oxygen (or hypoxic) zones harm or kill animals that require oxygen to live, including many commercially important species. Higher carbon dioxide levels Algae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially cyanoHABs that can float to the surface of the water and use the increased carbon dioxide. Increased levels of carbon dioxide also increase the acidity of the water, which affects competition among algal species and impacts the organisms that graze on algae. These effects can combine to increase the competitive advantage of HAB species. Changes in rainfall and resulting increases in nutrient loadings A satellite image of a cyanoHAB -taken on October 8, 2022-  in the western basin of Lake Erie. (Image credit: European Space Agency) Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns, increasing both rainfall intensity and the duration of drought. Increased rainfall causes higher nutrient runoff from land into waterbodies fueling HABs like those observed in Lake Erie in 2011 and 2015. If followed by extended drought, waterbodies can retain those nutrients for longer, favoring HAB species that compete better under higher nutrient conditions. Moreover, increases in extreme rainfall and subsequent increases in freshwater flows may flush large loads of nutrients, freshwater HABs and their associated toxins into estuaries and marine areas. As a result, estuarine and marine waters may be at greater risk of developing HABs or seeing an exacerbation of existing HABs. Sea level rise Scientists predict that sea level could rise one meter by the year 2100. This would increase the area of shallow, stable coastal waters that provide more favorable conditions for HABs. Coastal upwelling Coastal upwelling occurs when wind pushes warm, surface water offshore and deep, nutrient rich waters rise to replace it. Climate change is expected to alter the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling. Along the west coast of the United States, excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms, including HABs, especially when combined with increased runoff of nutrient pollution from the land.

With the summer swim and water recreation season heading into high gear, public health representatives urged caution for anyone headed to the lake or likely to take their pets there. Exposure to cyanotoxins can cause severe illness, including skin irritation, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, fever, and muscle and joint pain. People are advised especially to avoid ingestion of untreated lake water or direct contact with water “that appears discolored, has scum layers, or emits a foul odor.” Those who are exposed should immediately rinse off with clean water. Pets and livestock should be kept away. Regular testing of the lake has detected dense bands of blooming blue-green algae ―technically called cyanobacteria and not an algae at all ― throughout Clear Lake but particularly in the lower arm and in the bays west of Buckingham Point . The appearance of cyanobacteria in Clear Lake is not unusual, but it has occurred earlier and in greater abundance than in typical years. So far, sampling has not turned up signs of toxins, said Sarah Ryan, environmental manager and emergency management director for the Big Valley Band of Pomo Indians, which conducts lake testing for the county. She said results for samples collected May 21 have not come back yet, however, and said the county was acting out of an abundance of caution in issuing an advisory. Blue-green algae has become increasingly common in freshwater bodies around the country amid rising temperatures and extended heat waves. As a result, the State Water Resources Control Board conducted a spate of “pre-holiday” at 65 popular water bodies. Advisories already have been issued for several sites around the Bay Area and in Southern California. Large algal blooms can be reported to the state Harmful Algal Bloom hotline at 844-729-6466.

At the same time, they are among the oldest organisms in the world, dating back 2.1bn years, and we owe them a debt of gratitude . Cyanobacteria were the first organisms to use photosynthesis, turning carbon dioxide into oxygen. They are responsible for creating the oxygen-rich atmosphere that enabled life on Earth to flourish and humans to evolve. In their untold trillions, in almost every environment where there is water, even on damp rocks in deserts, they continue this valuable service, keeping the atmosphere safe for mammals to breathe. But in nutrient-rich water, created by farm waste or sewage released into rivers and lakes, blue-green algae multiply fast, especially in warm sunshine. This is dangerous in still waters where they form dense rafts of scum that deprive the waters below of oxygen, killing fish. In some circumstances they also create toxins that can poison animals and humans that drink it. Only laboratory tests can establish whether such algae blooms are toxic but anyone seeing one is advised to avoid it and report its presence.

This is in response to a water sample taken by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on April 25, 2024. The public should exercise caution in and around Little Big Econ – Jay Blanchard Park. Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to begin doing so remains poorly understood. For this reason, it is important to exercise caution, as bloom conditions are dynamic and could change at any time. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) collects algae samples from reported bloom locations for toxin analysis. Once completed, the results will be posted on the FDEP Algal Bloom Dashboard , and can also be viewed on the Protecting Florida Together website, where you can sign up to be notified of the latest conditions. Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: We do not recommend that you swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski, or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Avoid getting water in your eyes, nose, or mouth. You should keep pets and livestock away from the waters in this location. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is safe. Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish to the appropriate temperature. You should not eat shellfish from this location. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals. For additional information on potential health effects of algal blooms, visit floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/aquatic-toxins . Find current information about Florida’s water quality status and public health notifications for harmful algal blooms and beach conditions by visiting ProtectingFloridaTogether.gov . Protecting Florida Together is the state’s joint effort to provide statewide water quality information to prioritize environmental transparency and commitment to action . What do I do if I see an algal bloom? The Florida Department of Environmental Protection collects and analyzes algal bloom samples. To report a bloom to FDEP, call the toll-free hotline at 855-305-3903 or report online . To report fish kills, contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute at 1-800-636-0511. Report symptoms from exposure to a harmful algal bloom or any aquatic toxin to the Florida Poison Information Center, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak to a poison specialist immediately. Contact your veterinarian if you believe your pet has become ill after consuming or having contact with blue-green algae contaminated water.

Here’s where it’s worst and how to stay safe By Matt Bloom · Aug. 4, 2023, 2:04 pm Share: Town of Windsor Blue-green algae at Windsor Lake on Friday, July 19, 2019. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials are limiting paddleboarding, swimming and other in-water activities at at least four of the state’s most-visited recreational reservoirs due to toxic blue-green algae blooms. Managers at Barr Lake and Cherry Creek reservoirs in Metro Denver sectioned off parts of the lakes due to blooms earlier this week. In Southern Colorado, Road Canyon and Deweese reservoirs have been off-limits to swimmers and pets for several weeks. “Temperatures are hot and water is stagnant, which means our toxin levels are high,” said Michelle Seabert, park manager at Barr Lake State Park. “People need to be algae aware.” The algae growth is pretty typical for this time of year, when hot temperatures fuel the growth of cyanobacteria living in waterways, Seabert said. Wildlife managers say they’re testing water levels in all state reservoirs and expect to issue more warnings in the weeks to come. At least eight other bodies of water around the state have reported blooms that are being tested, according to an online tracker run by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Blue-green algae often forms in stagnant areas of shallow water and “looks like paint” while floating on the water’s surface, Seabert said. It’s fueled by hot weather and high levels of nutrients in the water, such as phosphorus and nitrogen. Green, chunkier algae that floats in deeper water is usually harmless, she added. The toxins in the blue-green species can hurt animals and humans. If ingested, it can damage a person’s skin, liver, as well as digestive and neurological systems. “It can make dogs very sick and even cause death,” Seabert said. If you or your pet come in contact with algae, it’s best to wash off quickly and contact your health care provider. Peak algae season typically runs through the end of August and early September, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Activities like boating and hiking around reservoirs are still permitted.

                    By Jeremy Moule Published November 14, 2023 at 10:30 AM EST Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Adobe Stock Images Canandaigua Lake State and local officials have finalized a plan to address the harmful algal blooms that have plagued Canandaigua Lake in recent years. The community-led plan focuses heavily on reducing the amount of phosphorous that gets washed into the lake by streams and storms by 25 percent over the next decade. Phosphorous is a nutrient that occurs naturally but is also a major component of manure and fertilizers used by farmers, homeowners, and others. It fuels the cyanobacteria that form the harmful algal blooms. “Canandaigua Lake does not have high levels of phosphorus,” said Tony Prestigiacomo, the supervisor of the state Department of Environmental Conservation’s Finger Lakes Watershed Hub. “But given the challenges of managing these types of blooms with what is controllable, we feel that the controllable element is phosphorus inputs to the lake, so this plan helps us to organize activities to limit that.” Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, can release toxins into the water that can sicken people and animals. The plan recommends a series of voluntary actions to stem the flow of phosphorous into Canandaigua Lake. For example, it recommends farmers use cover crops —plants that help prevent erosion and bolster soil health — and comprehensive nutrient management practices to reduce the wash off. “We found through the analysis that the largest contributor as a percentage to Canandaigua was agricultural land, either in row crops or pasture and hay,” Prestigiacomo said. It also recommends using green infrastructure and vegetation buffers to filter stormwater, which can wash pollution from hard surfaces like parking lots into streams. And it calls for anti-erosion projects and preserving undeveloped land, among other things. The report was shaped by community organizations and the Department of Environmental Conservation handled the technical work like developing models, Prestigiacomo said.

Brian Mast, R-Fla., calling for 'long-term halt' to Lake Okeechobee water discharges Prev Next Health officials in Martin County on Friday said recent test results have uncovered harmful blue-green algae in local waterways. By: Matt Papaycik Posted at 1:01 PM, Mar 29, 2024 MARTIN COUNTY, Fla. — Health officials in Martin County on Friday said recent test results have uncovered harmful blue-green algae in local waterways. The Florida Department of Health in Martin County said blue-green algal toxins were found in the St. Lucie Canal at the 96th Street Bridge, the St. Lucie River at Four Rivers, and the St. Lucie River at the Palm City Bridge. WPTV The Florida Department of Health in Martin County said blue-green algal toxins were found in the St. Lucie Canal at the 96th Street Bridge, the St. Lucie River at Four Rivers, and the St. Lucie River at the Palm City Bridge on March 25 and 26, 2024. SPECIAL SECTION: Protecting Paradise Water samples were taken from those areas on Monday and Tuesday. The public is urged not to swim, wade, boat, or use personal watercraft in areas where there's a visible bloom, and wash your skin and clothes if you come in contact with algae or discolored or smelly water. Also, keep your pets away from any water with visible algae blooms. ""Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals,"" the health department said in a news release. U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla  wrote a letter addressed to Army Corps Col. James Booth stating, ""the residents of the City of Stuart, Martin County, Florida, and those that use the water deserve to have access to safe water, but you are currently poisoning us."" The newly released test results come one day after Mast called on the Army Corps of Engineers to issue a long-term halt to water discharges from Lake Okeechobee, arguing that's the only way to prevent the spread of blue-green algae. ""There is no bigger polluter of our community than the United States government,"" Mast said during a news conference in Stuart on Thursday. ""The Corps of Engineers is the biggest polluter of the Indian River Lagoon, the St. Lucie Estuary, the Treasure Coast. Our government. We pay their salaries with our tax dollars."" Matthew Kauerauf/WPTV U.S. Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., discusses Lake Okeechobee discharges during a news conference, March 28, 2024, in Stuart, Fla. Mast has repeatedly urged Booth to stop the freshwater releases from the lake into the St. Lucie Estuary. The Army Corps in February began discharging up to one billion gallons of water into estuaries to get lake levels down and prevent flooding. The releases will stop for two weeks starting this weekend ahead of the oyster spawning season. In a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers on Monday, Mast called the two-week halt ""woefully insufficient,"" adding that ""the only way to prevent another lost summer is a long-term halt."" ""You create the situation of what will become toxic, because of what you have turned this estuary into. A freshwater estuary instead of a salt and brackish estuary,"" Mast said Thursday. ""You destroy the ecosystem for seagrass, for dolphin, for sea turtles, for take your pick."" Booth told WPTV anchor Michael Williams on Tuesday that after the two-week pause, he anticipated the resuming discharges to be much lower releases. ""Because we've seen nearly a foot come off the lake,"" Booth said. WPTV U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Col. James Booth explains to WPTV anchor Michael Williams the current need for water discharges from Lake Okeechobee. An abnormally wet winter has already helped to foster an algae bloom on Lake Okeechobee, fueling fears that the problem will worsen ahead of hotter weather and the rainy season.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Today, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) urged people to avoid physical contact with water at Pyramid Lake in Los Angeles County until further notice due to the presence of blue-green algae. Vaquero Swim Beach is closed, and Emigrant Landing Beach has a caution algal bloom advisory. People should also avoid eating fish or shellfish from the lake. Boating is allowed, but swimming and other water-contact recreation and sporting activities are not considered safe due to potential adverse health effects. Algal bloom treatment is planned for August 2 to help improve conditions possibly in a few weeks. For latest conditions and danger advisory information, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website . Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats and scum, form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Take care that pets and livestock do not drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algal blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat mussels or other bivalves collected from these areas. No fish should be consumed under a danger advisory. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

An algal bloom clogging a waterway near Lough Neagh in Northern Ireland Chris Baraniuk Save this story Save Save this story Save Standing on the marina, Rob Skelly peers into the darkness of the river where bright speckles of algae drift in the water. A neon green invader. “It’s starting to build,” he says. “Tomorrow, you’ll find that there’s clumps like that all over the river—and then the day after that there’ll be more and more.” Until this summer, Skelly had never seen algae wax and wane like this in the River Bann, a major waterway in Northern Ireland. The owner of the Cranagh Activity Centre set up his thriving water sports business 27 years ago, and it has been in this location since 2015. The algae has killed it. Following news reports of toxin-producing blue-green algae in lakes and rivers around Northern Ireland, people began canceling their bookings for water-skiing lessons and similar activities in droves. Skelly doesn’t blame them. “How can I put customers into that?” he says, looking at the mottled water below us. The season ruined, Skelly has decided to close his business for good. “You know, it’s heartbreaking.” Blue-green algae is coming to a river or lake near you, almost without doubt. The scourge of toxic blooms is becoming increasingly problematic worldwide, in part due to the climate crisis. Despite the name, blue-green algae aren’t actually algae, but a group of photosynthesizing bacteria called cyanobacteria. Under the right conditions, they can suddenly proliferate across huge expanses of water, leaving characteristic grayish-blue marks at the edges of lakes or rivers. Often, a highly unpleasant, rich, drain-like smell pervades in affected areas. These microbes sometimes produce huge quantities of toxins—cyanotoxins—which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, breathing difficulties, and occasionally even death in humans. Outbreaks have been associated with pet and livestock fatalities . People in the United States living near lakes where cyanobacteria regularly bloom have a higher risk of liver cancer , and some research suggests that cyanotoxins might even cause motor neurone disease , though further investigations are warranted to prove that particular connection. Research suggests that cyanotoxins can likely be aerosolized and breathed in when water is kicked up during recreational activities or fishing. Genetic analysis hints that cyanobacteria have been around for roughly 3 billion years. While the dumping of sewage and nutrient runoff from farms have long been known to swell the bacteria’s ranks in bodies of water, the cyanobacteria seem to be really flourishing now as global temperatures and atmospheric levels of CO 2 rise .

Wood Culture Behind That Viral LA Billboard That Trolled Microsoft and Other Game Companies By Megan Farokhmanesh Politics US Leaders Dodge Questions About Israel’s Influence Campaign By Dell Cameron “That, I think, is the really compelling evidence for the link to climate change—we’re seeing these increases in places where there hasn’t been a really substantial increase in urbanization or fertilizer application,” says Hans Paerl at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill’s Institute of Marine Sciences. “It is a global problem.” Cyanobacteria are proving to be a menace practically everywhere—from Florida to Africa and China, to name a few examples. In China’s Lake Taihu, the blooms are so bad that authorities have battled for years to physically remove the sludge with special machines that chew it up using hundreds of tiny teeth . This year in Northern Ireland, some of the most serious blooms have occurred in Lough Neagh, the largest body of fresh water by surface area in the UK and Ireland. Some locals have described algal blooms on the lough as the worst they have seen in their lifetimes, and there have been reports of multiple dog deaths possibly caused by cyanotoxins. From Lough Neagh, water flows into the River Bann and heads north toward the town of Coleraine, where Rob Skelly’s water sports business was located until recently. Finally, the Bann enters the sea on the north coast of Northern Ireland. Warnings about blue-green algae were put up on beaches there earlier this summer. WIRED showed Paerl pictures of a blueish residue above the waterline at a jetty very near to Lough Neagh. “It’s an indication of very high amounts of material,” he says. Around 40 percent of all Northern Ireland’s drinking water is sourced from Lough Neagh. NI Water, the public body responsible for drinking water, says it uses methods known to remove cyanotoxins. Chlorination alone is not enough, notes Paerl. In 2007, a blue-green algal bloom at Lake Taihu in China was so severe that 2 million people were forced to go without drinking water for at least a week . A spokeswoman for NI Water says that drinking water is treated using granular activated carbon, a kind of filtration that removes certain chemicals, including cyanotoxins. Tests for one particular cyanotoxin, microcystin-LR, in drinking water post-treatment have consistently shown extremely low levels throughout 2023, well below World Health Organization guidelines, she adds. However, NI Water does not test for cyanotoxins in the source water. “To the best of my knowledge, no one has yet tested for toxins either in water or fish,” says Matt Service at Northern Ireland’s Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute. Some local scientists are concerned that our understanding of how abundant these toxins are in places like Lough Neagh remains very murky. “I was interested in whether I could get some funding to specifically study the toxicology of the blue-green algae,” says Neil Reid, a senior lecturer in conservation biology at Queen’s University Belfast. He has collected multiple samples of surface water but hasn’t yet been able to secure the funding needed to conduct research on them. Reid points out that quite a lot of the visible sludge could be a harmless species of algae and not the dreaded cyanobacteria. It would help local people understand the risk when fishing on the lough, for example, if they knew more about its toxicity, he suggests. But, for now, the samples will remain frozen in a laboratory freezer.

Wood Culture Behind That Viral LA Billboard That Trolled Microsoft and Other Game Companies By Megan Farokhmanesh Politics US Leaders Dodge Questions About Israel’s Influence Campaign By Dell Cameron Besides nutrients entering lakes and rivers, which can spur the proliferation of algae and cyanobacteria, there are other factors that can trigger major blooms. Northern Ireland just had its wettest July on record —potentially accelerating the runoff of nutrients into bodies of water including Lough Neagh, says Reid. The lough is also 1 degree Celsius warmer today than it was just 30 years ago . That could benefit cyanobacteria over competing species, including algae, says Don Anderson, a senior scientist in the biology department at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. “When it gets too hot, other species don’t grow, or grow slowly,” he explains. “Cyanobacteria are extraordinarily flexible in terms of their tolerance.” Then there’s the zebra mussels. These invasive mollusks have been resident in Lough Neagh since at least 2005 . Here, as in other lakes in Europe and the United States, they appear to have consumed large quantities of algae, clarifying the water in the process. That might sound good, but the problem, Reid explains, is that this then allows more light into the lake, potentially giving the cyanobacteria a chance to thrive while their competitors get gobbled up by the mussels. “I think it’s a very reasonable hypothesis,” says Robin Rohwer at the University of Texas at Austin, who has studied the prevalence of cyanotoxins in Lake Mendota in Wisconsin . Data collected across two decades suggests that, following zebra mussel invasion, the “toxic season” on the lake during the summer lengthened dramatically—lasting more than 50 days longer, on average. There are plenty of mysteries, though. Rohwer says she didn’t detect a boom in the cyanobacteria itself, just an increase in the volume of toxins present in the lake. What’s driving that remains unclear. Rohwer adds that, as someone who enjoys sailing on the lake herself, she avoids boating whenever algae buildup is visible. In unpublished results, she says she has found that toxin levels out in the middle of the lake aren’t usually a serious concern—though she has detected “extremely toxic” scum washed up at the shoreline. There’s little that humans can do to stymie blue-green algal blooms, says Paerl. And Rohwer notes that it is practically impossible to eradicate zebra mussels once they have become established. The only tactic available, really, is reducing nutrient runoff into lakes and rivers, for example by lowering fertilizer use on farms and building buffer zones or artificial wetlands around the edges of large bodies of water to try to soak up the nutrients. Paerl says such efforts have been reasonably successful in North Carolina, for example. For Rob Skelly, the damage, sadly, is already done. He says he has spent recent months chasing public bodies over the cyanobacteria problem. “Nobody will take responsibility,” he alleges, adding that the sudden closure of his business feels like the end of an era. Many former customers have been in touch, he says, to express their regret at what has happened. “I have loved every day of my working life because I’ve had the river. It’s just been part of my DNA,” adds Skelly. “I never thought it would be the river that would come back and bite me.” You Might Also Like … In your inbox: Will Knight's Fast Forward explores advances in AI Welcome to the hellhole of programmatic advertising How many EV charging stations does the US need to replace gas stations?

By Brent Weber Published : Jul. 24, 2023 at 11:01 PM CDT Email This Link Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn OMAHA, Neb. (WOWT) - Every summer it blooms, just like it has for two billion years. Blue-green algae is a form of cyanobacteria and is an organism, but not a plant. And when the conditions are ripe... “Probably my favorite description is if somebody dumped John Deere green paint on the water,” said Dave Schumacher, the monitoring section supervisor at the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy . “Wave action will typically push it up on shore, and when it dies it goes from a john deer green color to almost like a turquoise blue.” Heading into a week of 100-degree temperatures in parts of Nebraska, two lakes are currently under HAB alerts due to harmful algae blooms: Big Indian Lake and Swanson Reservoir. In the metro and specifically, Omaha, Lake Cunningham executive director Brook Bench said the state and the Corps of Engineers are rigorous with their regular testing of recreational lakes and beaches across Nebraska. Lake Cunningham and others in the metro show plenty of seasonal algae, but none of them are currently showing any dangerous levels of anything, especially blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria like blue-green algae produce a range of toxins that pose a danger to humans and animals “Lakes like this that were built for flood control, you get a heavy rain, you get a nice flush that comes through, things wash through and it kind of starts the process over again,” Bench said. “We have had some timely rains here in the last few weeks, so that’s been very helpful to keep it balanced and just keep getting fresh water coming in so that definitely has helped with the current algae that we have.” Since Lake Cunningham doesn’t allow swimming, he’s not as worried about anyone getting exposed to any algae, dangerous or not. He says kayaking, stand-up paddling, boating, and fishing are completely safe. According to the Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy, “HABs can dominate the algal populations of a lake under the right combinations of water temperature, low water depths, and nutrients (such as high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from wastewater discharges and runoff from agricultural land and communities).” The NDEE advises to watch for the following aspects in lake water or at beaches: Water that has a neon green, pea green, blue-green or reddish-brown color. Water that has a bad odor. Foam, scum, or a thick paint-like appearance on the water surface. Green or blue-green streaks on the surface. Areas with algae that look like grass clippings floating in the water. When algal blooms are present at a lake, avoid protected bays and shorelines on the windward side of the lake. These are areas that generally have higher concentrations of algae and potentially toxins. The public is simply advised to steer clear of algae blooms, whether we know they are blue-green or seasonal algae. Rowing, paddling, or boating across algae are bad ideas. And although dogs may be our best friends , they often don’t differentiate between fun in the water and some nasty slimy stuff on top. Cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins that are a danger to humans and animals. “It’s always better to be safe than sorry,” Bench said. “The lake does get tested, (but) if you see those any of those blooms, you definitely don’t want to have your dogs in the water. That can be can be up to lethal for dogs.” Anglers will tell you seasonal algae provides shade on 100-degree days for some fish, so they’ll even work their lines alongside the blooms, hoping to get a bite. Eating the fish from these waters - or even those with blue-green algae, doesn’t pose a threat to humans, according to the NDEE and other sources. “The state has stocked and done a wonderful job of putting the fish back in the lake after it was drawn down (three years ago),” Bench said. There are a lot of people fishing today even though it’s this hot, and so I know people are catching fish, and we’re excited for the people to catch fish, and hopefully, they’ll be able to do it for years.” Lake Cunningham and most other parks have links to water testing results.

                    By Tom Bayles Published May 20, 2024 at 2:32 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 3:12 1 of 1 — BGA frm oEPA unknown lov=cation.JPG The blue-green algae outbreaks in the Caloosahatchee River so far this year have not been as bad as the one in this image taken by the Environmental Protection Agency to display on its website about harmful algal blooms Environmental Protection Agency /  WGCU WATER QUALITY REPORT FOR MAY 18, 2023 It’s the time of year when warnings about blue-green algae outbreaks will be a regular part of this column as the harmful algae will start popping up everywhere, peaking in August. However, there is no telling how the hyperactive hurricane season may affec t the normal rhythm of the abnormal amount of blue-green algae that Southwest Florida has to contend with yearly. There are some rumblings that heavy summer rains or a hurricane may break up the summertime coating of blue-green algae over Lake Okeechobee, which is supposed to be especially bad this year. Or it won’t. And the water the Army Corps releases down the Caloosahatchee River regularly to control the level of the Big Lake may carry Big Chunks of algae with it. For now, the Florida Department of Health in Lee County issued its sixth health advisory this year due to blue-green algae in the Caloosahatchee River. Tom Bayles / WGCU The health department detected the presence of harmful blue-green algae toxins in a canal that leads to the Caloosahatchee River West Basin Storage Reservoir, which is under construction and when completed sometime in the next two years it will hold more than 55 billion gallons of water. Being built on 10,700 acres of former farmland in Hendry County , the reservoir is part of an overall solution to restore the river and estuary, including water quality improvements, storage, and operational changes. Two weeks ago, the health department found the harmful algae just to the west of the Broadway Street Bridge in the canals next to Sebastian Court in Alva. Blue-green algae can be dangerous. Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, or come into contact with water if you can see a bloom. The best idea when you can see a visible bloom is to go somewhere else. If you have any contact with algae, or discolored water that smells unpleasant wash your skin and clothing with soap and water. Ingestion of a component of toxic blue-green algae called Microcystis may cause vomiting, nausea, headaches, diarrhea, pneumonia, and fever. Keep your pets away from the water, and do not let them drink the water or get in it. Blue-green algae have killed pets and livestock. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is safe. Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts, and cook fish thoroughly. However, do not eat shellfish in waters with algae blooms. “Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to do so remains poorly understood,” the health department warns in a statement. ""Since bloom conditions can change at any time, it is important to exercise caution as if the bloom were toxic, even if toxin presence has not yet been confirmed.” Bayles, Tom Let’s just hope and hope that the blue-green algae outbreaks remain as relatively small as they have been so far this year. We don’t need another coating of the smelly and slimy algae all over everything like the summer of 2018. RED TIDE The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission sampled for any above-normal amounts of the red tide organism, Karenia brevis , and found none. Yippee. No reports of fish kills suspected to be related to red tide were received over the past week, nor was there any respiratory Irritation reported in Florida over the past week related to the harmful algae bloom. BLUE-GREEN ALGAE The agency reminds residents that winds and tides tend to push the components of blue-green algae around, so people in that region should be watchful for the potentially toxic bloom. Lake Okeechobee shows a high potential for a significant bloom this summer. The FDEP says it is important to remember the blue-green algae potential is subject to change due to rapidly changing environmental conditions or satellite inconsistencies. What is red tide? Red tide is one type of harmful algal bloom caused by high concentrations of the toxic dinoflagellate K. brevis , which is a type of microscopic algae found in the Gulf of Mexico. Red tide typically forms naturally offshore, commonly in late summer or early fall, and is carried into coastal waters by winds and currents. Once inshore, these opportunistic organisms can use nearshore nutrient sources to fuel their growth. Blooms typically last into winter or spring, but in some cases, can endure for more than one year. Is red tide harmful? K. brevis produces potent neurotoxins that can be harmful to the health of both wildlife and people. Wind and wave action can break open K. brevis cells and release toxins into the air. This is why you should monitor conditions and stay away from beaches where red tide is in bloom. People in coastal areas can experience varying degrees of eye, nose and throat irritation during a red tide bloom. Some individuals with chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or chronic lung disease might experience more severe symptoms. Red tide toxins can also affect the central nervous system of fish and other marine life, which can lead to fish kills. What causes red tide? A red tide bloom develops naturally, but recent studies have discovered mankind's infusion of other nutrients into the mix can make the red tide last longer or get stronger. But biology (the organisms), chemistry (natural or man-made nutrients for growth) and physics (concentrating and transport mechanisms) interact to produce the algal bloom. No one factor causes the development of a red tide bloom. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are a group of organisms that can live in freshwater, saltwater or brackish water. Large concentrations, called blooms, can change the water color to blue, green, brown, orange or red. Some cyanobacterial blooms can look like foam, scum, or mats on the surface of freshwater lakes and ponds. As algae in a cyanobacterial bloom die, the water may smell like something with a naturally unpleasant odor has now started to rot, too. Is blue-green algae harmful? Different types of blue-green algal bloom species can look different and have different impacts. However, regardless of species, many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins that can make you or your pets sick if swallowed or possibly cause skin and eye irritation. The FDEP advises staying out of water where algae is visibly present as specks or mats or where water is discolored. Pets or livestock should not come into contact with algal bloom-impacted water or with algal bloom material or fish on the shoreline. If they do, wash the animals right away. What causes blue-green algae? Blue-green algae blooms occur when the algae that are typically present grow in numbers more than normal. Within a few days, a bloom can cause clear water to become cloudy. Winds tend to push the floating blooms to the shore where they become more noticeable. Cyanobacterial blooms can form in warm, slow-moving waters that are rich in nutrients. Blooms can occur at any time, but most often occur in late summer or early fall.

Photo taken May 11, 2023. Today, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) urges people to avoid physical contact with water at Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County until further notice due to the presence of blue-green algae. People should also avoid eating fish or shellfish from the lake. This week’s lab results show an increase in toxin levels. A danger advisory was put in place today, and remains in effect for the entire Castaic Lake, except Castaic Lagoon, until further notice. It is advised for people and pets to stay out of the water and avoid contact with algal scum in the water or on shore. Boating is allowed, but water-contact recreation and sporting activities are not considered safe due to potential adverse health effects. For latest conditions and d anger advisory information, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website . Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats, and scum, form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Take care that pets and livestock do not drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algal blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat mussels or other bivalves collected from these areas. No fish should be consumed under a danger advisory. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

(KPTV) By Shayndel Jones Published : May. 25, 2024 at 12:21 PM CDT Email This Link Share on Facebook Share on X (formerly Twitter) Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn TOPEKA, Kan. (WIBW) - Kansas Department of Health and Environment shared blue-green algae warnings and watches in Kansas. KDHE officials said on Friday, May 24, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) have issued a public health advisory due to blue-green algae at seven Kansas lakes, including one in Shawnee County. KDHE officials indicated a harmful algal bloom (HAB) may look like foam, scum or paint floating on the water and be colored blue, bright green, brown or red. Blooms can develop rapidly; if the water appears suspicious or there is decaying algae on the shore, avoid contact and keep pets away. These toxins can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation of aerosols and even skin contact. Symptoms vary depending upon the type of exposure (e.g. direct contact, ingestion, inhalation) but can include rash, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, sore throat, and headache. If you, or your pets, come into contact with algae rinse the area with clean, fresh water. Suspected HAB-related health incidents, whether human or animal, regardless of season, should be reported at kdhe.ks.gov/1163 . KDHE shared the following active advisories: Warning Atchison State Fishing Lake, Atchison County Harvey County East Lake, Harvey County Herington City Lake (Old), Dickinson County (Added May 24) Watch Lake Shawnee, Shawnee County Lovewell Lake, Jewell County Marion County Lake, Marion County Marion Lake (Reservoir), Marion County KDHE officials said a Hazard status indicates that a harmful algal bloom is present, and extreme conditions exist. When a hazard is issued, KDHE recommends the following precautions be taken: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. It is recommended that either a portion of the lake or the entire lake or zone, be closed to the public. In some cases, the adjacent land should be closed as well. Actual setback distances will be determined on a site-specific basis, if necessary. When partial closures (i.e., beach or cove) are issued, the remaining lake or zone area will carry a warning status. KDHE officials indicated a Warning status indicates that conditions are unsafe for human and pet exposure.  Contact with the waterbody should be avoided. When a warning is issued, KDHE recommends the following precautions be taken: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Inhalation of spray or aerosols may be harmful. Lake water is not safe to drink for pets or livestock. Lake water, regardless of blue-green algae status, should never be consumed by humans. Water contact should be avoided. Fish may be eaten if they are rinsed with clean water and only the fillet portion is consumed, while all other parts are discarded. Do not allow pets to eat dried algae. If lake water contacts skin, wash with clean water as soon as possible. Avoid areas of visible algae accumulation. KDHE officials stated a Watch status means that blue-green algae have been detected and a harmful algal bloom is present or likely to develop. People are encouraged to avoid areas of algae accumulation and keep pets and livestock away from the water. During the watch status, KDHE recommends the following precautions be taken: Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Water may be unsafe for humans/animals. Avoid areas of algae accumulation and do not let people/pets eat dried algae or drink contaminated water. Swimming, wading, skiing and jet skiing are discouraged near visible blooms. Boating and fishing are safe. However, inhalation of the spray may affect some individuals. Avoid direct contact with water, and wash with clean water after any contact. Clean fish thoroughly with potable water and eat fillet portion only. Officials with KDHE said advisories are lifted when cell densities and toxin concentrations dissipate to levels below the Watch thresholds. KDHE officials said they investigate publicly accessible bodies of water for blue-green algae when the agency receives reports of potential algae blooms in Kansas lakes. Based on credible field observation and sampling results, KDHE reports on potentially harmful conditions. KDHE officials noted if you observe a scum or paint-like surface on the water, small floating blue-green clumps or filaments in the water, or if the water is an opaque green, avoid contact and keep pets away. These are indications that a harmful bloom may be present. Pet owners should be aware that animals that swim in or drink water affected by a harmful algal bloom or eat dried algae along the shore may become seriously ill or die.

(KWCH) - Sedgwick County, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks (KDWP) are monitoring Lake Afton for harmful levels of blue-green algae. The county said current conditions do not warrant a public health advisory. The county said a harmful algal bloom (HAB) may look like foam, scum or paint floating on the water and be colored blue, bright green, brown or red. Click here to see local examples of blue-green algae. “Blooms can develop rapidly,” said the county. “If the water appears suspicious or there is decaying algae on the shore, avoid contact and keep pets away.” Animals that swim in or drink water with harmful algal bloom or eat dried algae along the shore may become seriously ill or die. Toxins can be absorbed by ingestion, inhalation of aerosols and even skin contact, according to the county. Symptoms vary depending upon the type of exposure but can include rash, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, sore throat and headache. If you or your pets come into contact with algae, rinse the area with clean, fresh water. The county said all suspected HAB-related health incidents should be reported at KDHE Algal Bloom Incident Report . On April 4, 2024, the state issued this year’s first blue-green algae warning for Harvey County East Lake. KDHE will issue the following advisories, as needed, in the months ahead: A Hazard status indicates that a harmful algal bloom is present, and extreme conditions exist. Signage should be posted at all public access locations. It is recommended that either a portion of the lake or the entire lake or zone be closed to the public. In some cases, the adjacent land should be closed as well. Actual setback distances will be determined on a site-specific basis, if necessary. When partial closures (i.e., beach or cove) are issued, the remaining lake or zone area will carry a warning status. A Warning status indicates that conditions are unsafe for human and pet exposure. Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Water contact should be avoided. Inhalation of spray or aerosols may be harmful. Lake water is not safe to drink for pets or livestock. Do not allow pets to eat dried algae. Fish may be eaten if they are rinsed with clean water and only the fillet portion is consumed, while all other parts are discarded. If lake water contacts skin, wash with clean water as soon as possible. Avoid areas of visible algae accumulation. A Watch status means that blue-green algae have been detected and a harmful algal bloom is present or likely to develop. People are encouraged to avoid areas of algae accumulation and keep pets and livestock away from the water. Signage should be posted at all public access locations. Water may be unsafe for humans/animals. Avoid areas of algae accumulation, and do not let people/pets eat dried algae or drink contaminated water. Swimming, wading, skiing and jet skiing are discouraged near visible blooms. Boating and fishing are safe. However, inhalation of the spray may affect some individuals. Avoid direct contact with water, and wash with clean water after any contact. Clean fish thoroughly with potable water and eat fillet portion only. Advisories are lifted, when cell densities and toxin concentrations dissipate to levels below the Watch thresholds. KDHE investigates blue-green algae in publicly accessible bodies of water when the agency receives reports of potential algae blooms. Its reports are based on credible field observation and sampling results.

Innovators & Disruptors U.S. World Politics HealthWatch MoneyWatch Entertainment Crime Sports Essentials Watch CBS News U.S. Toxic algae is making people sick and killing animals – and it will likely get worse By Li Cohen July 18, 2023 / 9:21 AM EDT / CBS News There's now another kind of water hazard to be on the lookout for – toxic algae. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a report finding hundreds of harmful algal blooms across the U.S. sickened people and killed animals — a problem that is likely to get worse. Harmful algal blooms , otherwise identified as HABs, stem from the ""rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria"" in water. Some of the algae in these blooms produce toxins that can cause illnesses in both humans and animals, impacting health primarily through water exposure, but also through the air. Here's what to know. Where are the harmful algal blooms? Analyzing data from 2021, the CDC found 368 of these blooms across 16 states that year – Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Michigan and Pennsylvania had the most algal blooms – 77 each – while Utah had the most human illnesses. Washington had the most animal illnesses, as the toxic algae was linked to the deaths of more than 2,000 bats. California had the second-most animal cases, with 444 animals affected. The problem became worse during the summer months with the blooms peaking in August. In 2021, 248 of the blooms had no associated illnesses, while 48 were known to cause human illness, 79 caused animal illness and seven caused illnesses for both groups. More than half of the blooms, however, were filled with toxins. Most were in freshwater sources, such as lakes and reservoirs. In those, a ""green water color"" was frequently reported, the CDC said, although there were reports of illness when the water was clear. Unlike red tide events , which have long plagued Florida's waters, these blooms involve algae or cyanobacteria, which is also referred to as blue-green algae. Red tide, on the other hand, is formed by the bacteria Karenia brevis, which can make the water appear red or brown. How do harmful algal blooms affect humans? The CDC found that 117 people became ill after coming into contact with harmful blooms in 2021, about half of them children and teens. Just under three-quarters of those who became ill sought medical care, but there were no deaths. Most of the human illnesses related to the blooms occurred in June, the CDC found, and primarily in public outdoor areas and beaches. The most common symptoms people reported were gastrointestinal issues – mostly diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain – headaches, fatigue, fever, rashes, itchy and irritated skin, sore throat and coughing. How do harmful algal blooms affect animals? Animals were far more impacted by the harmful blooms in 2021 than humans, according to the CDC. At least 2,715 animals became sick from the blooms, with at least 92% dying from their exposure. Wildlife was overwhelmingly affected, although dogs and cattle were also among those affected. Most of the deaths occurred in Washington, where at least 2,000 bats died. The problem for animals was at its worst in August, when the blooms were at their peak. For pets, the most common symptoms of HAB-related illness were loss of appetite, lethargy, muscle tremors, weakness, vomiting and imbalance, although several other symptoms were reported. Among wildlife, the most common symptom of illness was dark urine. Toxic algal blooms could get worse The CDC said in its report that harmful algal bloom events ""can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature"" – both of which are expected to increase with climate change. As regional and global temperatures warm, so will the temperatures in freshwater systems, Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute says. ""Warmer water temperatures in deep lakes slows down processes that add oxygen to the water, creating dead zones, or areas with less oxygen that are unable to support life,"" according to the institute. ""These dead zones can produce large-scale fish mortality and toxic algal blooms."" Nutrient pollution is also expected to increase, as climate change spurs more extreme weather that can lead to more stormwater runoff. That runoff ""can result in conditions favorable for algal blooms,"" the university says. ""Consequently, with a changing climate, harmful algal blooms can occur more often, in more fresh or marine waterbodies and can be more intense,"" they said, adding that it could also end up affecting drinking water, as freshwater sources will need more treatment than usual.

Martin County boaters said the days of enjoying these waters are over. ""We do not touch the water. We don't even put our feet in when we're putting the boat in or out,"" Palm City boater Erika Maglione said. ""We stay as far away from the water as possible,"" Stuart boater Howard Mason said. ""I actually do less boating in here because of it,"" Stuart boater Glen Taylor said. WPTV Stuart boater Glen Taylor said the poor water quality has impacted where he spends time on the water. Boaters are heeding the warning from the Florida Health Department on Friday regarding a toxic blue-green algae bloom found in parts of the St. Lucie River. The Florida Department of Health in Martin County said blue-green algal toxins were found in the St. Lucie Canal at the 96th Street Bridge, the St. Lucie River at Four Rivers and the St. Lucie River at the Palm City Bridge. ""It can cause neurodegenerative diseases,"" Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades, said. ""It can lead to liver damage. It also can cause respiratory distress."" She said it's a serious public health concern, adding that you don't have to come in direct contact with the water to be at risk. Jackie Mason fears the health issues associated with toxic algae. Protecting Paradise Mast: 'No bigger polluter' of community than federal government Matt Papaycik 9:41 AM, Mar 28, 2024 ""Years ago my husband and I both got sick from the water,"" Jackie Mason said. ""I don't want to do that again."" The Army Corps of Engineers has announced that water releases will pause for two weeks beginning this weekend. However, Samples hopes they will stop discharges for longer than that, given Friday's health alert. ""Do you think this two-week break in water discharges is enough?"" WPTV reporter Cassandra Garcia asked Samples. WPTV Eve Samples discusses with WPTV reporter Cassandra Garcia the health effects people can face if they come into contact with toxic algae. ""Absolutely not, the two-week break is just a start,"" Samples responded. ""To protect the public, to protect our environment, we need to extend the relief period and keep the gates closed for much longer than two weeks, hopefully, until June 1 and beyond that.” The Masons said these discharges have destroyed the clean estuary they once knew. ""The first year we came here, people used to swim in this river,"" Howard Mason said. ""Now you wouldn't touch this river."" WPTV Howard and Jackie Mason talk about how the poor water quality has impacted their way of life. For now, they're holding on to hope that the Army Corps of Engineers will stop sending water east once and for all. The Florida Health Department in Martin County urges people not to drink, swim, wade or use a water vessel in waters where a visible algae bloom is present. They also advise washing your skin and clothes if you come in contact with algae. For the full list of recommendations see the health alert below: Copyright 2024 Scripps Media, Inc.

1. BlueExit treatment
2. Increasing plant density with new plants
3. Using ""Phorax"" as a phosphate remover
4. Changing all filter sponges
5. Large water change (70%) followed by weekly changes between 10-15%
6. Using a silicate remover
7. Manual removal of every algae I find

As of a week and a half ago, it was going well. I was at 0 ammonia, 1 nitrite, and 20 nitrates. I have plenty of the weird brown worms. 

My sister gave me some test strips, which I was using until I can get into a lfs this weekend for a water check (I haven’t purchased my own set yet, it’s on my list though). Nitrites, ammonia and nitrates were all registering as 0. I compared to my established tanks to make sure it wasn’t just the tests, and nitrates are reading in good levels on those tanks.

I then realized that the algae that was growing wasn’t just algae, it was Cyanobacteria. I had never seen it before, so it’s new to me. I removed what I could from the substrate (it found itself on some food I had thrown in to “feed” the cycle), the roots of some red root floaters, and one of my lava rocks). 

Is my cycle screwed? I’m finding conflicting information about what exactly this means for my cycle. I’ll be performing a black out for the next few days.",04 May 2024 23:59:44,reddit

Feed a pinch of food every 3 days and water changes 30 minutes after a feeding of 3 gallons but I cannot get this taken care of. I did pull out my rocks, wood, heater and sponge on the filter and cleaned them off completely but it came back. I also bought snails and currently have about 15 in there (started with 4) and they helped clean up some of the algae but I do not think they touched this stuff. Anyone have a guess of what I can do?

**water parameters**: 

* both phosphate and nitrate are extremely low (almost undetectable). 
* Hardness was also very low, so I added some seachem equilibrium and alkaline buffer. 

**Lighting**: a basic LED tank light. 8 hours per day. 

**filtration**: a well established HOB, the cartridge is a bit old. I assumed this was a good thing?

**Plants**: moderately planted. 

**fish**: low bioload. 2 dwarf rasboras and 3 small amano shrimp. weekly feeding.

Part of the problem is that I had been using deionized water, which has basically no nutrients in it at all. I naively assumed that this would limit the growth of algae, but obviously it hasn't. 

I've seen contradictory information about whether I should add nitrate and phosphate. Some sources say this will simply feed the algae, while other sources claim that a lack of nitrate is the probable cause.

I have a swimming pond / natural pool in my garden which the former house owner used as a koi pond. For some weeks now I have more and more algae growing and now I am concerned that its blue-green algae (Cyanobacteria). I hope someone here can help my identify my problem.

On all surfaces I have this film of algae that is green/brown and easily removable. It does not smell at all (supposed to smell bad for blue-green algae?) but it is very slimy. I have a biofilter with material to mechanically filter the water and to provide gigantic surfaces for good bacteria to live in. In addition I also have a UCV-clearer. Still, the algae appeared. My simple water tests show me no nitrates or nutritions, so I don’t really know where it comes from. But maybe my tests are just bad.

Based on the attached pictures, can someone tell me what kind of algae I have? Is it blue-green algae and makes this my pool unsafe to swim in? What could I do to remove it and make sure it doesn’t come back and I can swim in it again?

Last picture is the status I would like to get back to! :)

This prompted a third person to ask what the big deal was about gelatine, and my reply was approximately that shark collagen was the naz, being from an animal that went back to the Jurassic, over 500,000,000 years ago, and who theoretically was more undifferentiated, so accessible to either existing vestigial defense-systems, or some such cooperation, as if one cares why exactly the Amazon rainforest does what it does, versus stem cells from infant cadavers.

What's the difference between gelatin and collagen? Let alone, after digesting it with something like papain? Nyeh? Does one need to go to cadavers if all one is after is a smidgin of building block? For decades folks have taken gelatin pills for nails, teeth and such, and radioactive isotope-laced gelatine does indeed wind up in knee cartilage that is healing, for whatever reason.

A natural infant blood clot-dissoving chemnical supposedly would be a doozy, if responsible for things like pregnancy survival, as well as maniacs doing amniocentesis or whatever that thing is they used to do to foetus sacks before ultrasound...

Hello,

There's this strip of algae on the substrate only across the front of the tank. I first filled the tank 3 months ago so it's had some time to cycle. Fish and plants are otherwise healthy as near as I can tell. The tank has an automated light that follows the sun. The tank does not receive direct sunlight.

I do 30% RO water changes and clean the substrate weekly but it has not abated. In fact it seems to be creeping it's way towards the back of the tank. What could I change in my routine to potentially impact it's growth? Why is it only that strip? 

On a side note I also have a little brown algae bloom that I manage with weekly cleaning with a net, filter, and water changes.",12 Oct 2023 18:49:28,reddit

By Paul McClure
October 09, 2023

Researchers have used plasma technology to transform a species of blue-green microalgae into a bioactive coating with incredible wound-healing properties. They say the novel coating can be applied to dressings and medical devices to protect patients from infection, speed up healing and reduce inflammation.

Plasma is formed from gas so superheated that the electrons are ripped away from the atoms, resulting in a soup of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. An atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) provides a plasma discharge at ambient pressure using a noble gas/molecular gas mixture passed through a powerful electric arc discharge.

Researchers at Flinders University, South Australia, have used an argon APPJ to convert blue-green microalgae into an ultrathin bioactive coating that can be added to medical dressings to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation and promote wound healing.

“We are using the plasma coating technology to turn any type of biomass – in this case Spirulina maxima – into a sustainable high-end coating,” said Vi Khanh Truong, one of the study’s corresponding authors. “With our technology, we can transform biomass into coatings on wound dressing.”

Extract of S. maxima, a species of blue-green microalgae, is often used as a dietary supplement. The unicellular organism possesses a simple reproductive system that generates a biomass containing bioactive compounds with potent antioxidant and antibacterial properties that can assist with wound healing.

However, the thick cell walls of the microalgae pose a significant obstacle to extracting these valuable compounds. That’s where APPJ comes in. The researchers used the technology to selectively break down the microalgae’s thick walls, which resulted in a significant transformation. S. maxima lost its native structure, completely disintegrated, and subsequently reformed into ultrathin films.

A schematic depicting the one-step argon APPJ process to transform S. maxima biomass into an ultrathin bioactive coating and its applicationPham et al.
The antibacterial activity of the argon APPJ-treated S. maxima was assessed and found to be highly effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, with 93% and 73% cell death, respectively, and inhibited biofilm formation. Bacteria inside biofilm are much more resistant to antibiotics.

In addition to being biocompatible, the S. maxima coating exhibited anti-inflammatory properties. And a wound created by the researchers using wound scratch assay was completely closed in two days when the coating was used.

The researchers say this novel technique holds promise as a wound treatment, including the treatment of chronic wounds, particularly given the rise in antibiotic resistance.

“This new, plasma-facilitated downstream processing can improve extraction and purification of useful compounds from biomass without the need for harmful solvents and a lot of energy input,” said Krasimir Vasilev, the other corresponding author of the study. “We are now exploiting avenues for commercialization of this unique technology. Currently, there is no commercial wound dressings that simultaneously fight and protect from infection, favorably modulate inflammation and stimulate healing.”

The study was published in the journal Small.

Uncle Rico was my personal betta fish until I moved and no longer had the space for his tank in my house. Fortunately, I work at a high school and everyone was really excited to meet him! He is a well loved fish, but only myself, one specific student, and another teacher are allowed to feed him (the previous beta at the school was seriously over fed by students- very sad.) ANYWAYS the tank Uncle Rico moved into happened to have something in it with blue green algae on it. I did not know this. He relocated to this new and improved tank and now there is so much algae growing I have to clean the thing every 5 days or it gets coated in the nasty slimy stuff. Also very annoying because it really clogs the filter. 
How do I get rid of the algae?? I know it’s not bad for him, it’s just excessive.

My student is taking him home for winter break so fishy will be good, but I’d like to solve this algae issue. He has a 5 gal tank with plants (live and silk,) a SpongeBob pineapple, and floating log.
