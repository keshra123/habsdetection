Roaches are an unpleasant part of life, but if you live with dogs, your goal should be to avoid toxic pesticides at home. Just say no to the exterminator: According to the ASPCA, every year thousands of pets suffer and many die due to accidental ingestion of household poisons, especially insecticides. So, what *is* a pet-safe roach killer?

There are plug-in roach repellents, such as Riddex, but I have found they don’t work nearly as well as their hype says they do. Following folk wisdom, I’ve tried sprinkling bay leaves in the corners of my cabinets as a deterrent; but the leaves are just no match for tough urban roaches.

You can clean like a demon and bathe your dogs every single day, but keeping immaculate pets in a spotless home simply isn’t enough to repel roaches.

In fact, you can clean all day long and still have roaches, because these creepy-crawlies are attracted by odors — the smells of dog food, dog bedding, your bedding, your laundry. And in the good ol’ summertime, all those odors are magnified and made more pungent by high temperatures.

There are some non-toxic and pet-safe roach killers out there.

## Pet-Safe Roach Killer: Food-Grade Diatomaceous Earth

The most effective weapon in the anti-roach arsenal is diatomaceous earth, available for sale online. This white powder consists of the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. It’s completely harmless to pets and people, as long as you buy the food-grade kind (please do not use diatomaceous earth made for use in swimming pools). In fact, food-grade diatomaceous earth may be safely eaten by pets to fight internal parasites;it’s also effective at repelling mosquitos, fleas and even ticks if rubbed into an animal’s coat.

**Here’s how it works:** The microscopic particles in the powder actually cut up an insect’s waxy exoskeleton, effectively dessicating them. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (also known as diatom flour) wherever you’ve noticed roaches. It’s especially effective if placed behind kitchen appliances and inside cabinets. No need to use gloves – it’s perfectly safe to handle.

Don’t be discouraged if at first you seem to notice more roaches then before; for about a week after treating a roach-infested area with diatomaceous earth, you’ll actually see more of the crawling nasties. That’s because, as the diatomaceous earth works to dessicate them, the dehydrating bugs will be actively on the move, hunting for water.

If you live with cats, diatomaceous earth is also an excellent way to extend the life of kitty litter. As any cat person knows, litter tends to poop out in high-humidity weather conditions; as it becomes damp and soggy, it stops absorbing odors and doesn’t clump as effectively. But diatomaceous earth’s naturally dessicating property helps cut down on odors by working to keep cat droppings dry.

## Pet-Safe Roach Repellent: Catnip

Speaking of cats, another way to deter roaches is catnip. Yes, believe it or not, kitty’s favorite herb is a natural roach repellent! The active ingredient in it is nepetalactone, which is non-toxic to people and pets. Simply pinpoint where the roaches are meeting up at your place, and leave out small sachets of catnip. Obviously, if you live with cats, this method won’t work because kitty will get busy relocating those catnip toys before they can deter any roaches!

## Do Not Use Boric Acid Anywhere Your Pet Can Access

Roaches happen to gravitate to high places, such as the tops of kitchen cabinets or shelving. Break out your ladder and put boric acid up there; the roaches will take the powder with them back to their nests. However, boric acid is harmful to dogs and people if ingested, so keep it far away from kids and pets. If your cat, say, can access the space between your cabinetry and your ceiling, do not use boric acid — use only diatomaceous earth instead.",19 Apr 2024 01:43:43

5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1c5xnac/has_anyone_ever_tried_the_lost_and_found_ritual/,Has anyone ever tried the Lost and Found Ritual?,"Have you ever wondered about things you’ve lost? That toy car you remember having as a kid. That ring you had, tight on your finger as you dove into the sea, but gone when you got out. That braided phone charger, your middle-school homework book, I could go on.  

No need to answer. Everyone’s lost *something*, at some point, and never found it again. Their stories, without conclusion.

Most of us simply forget. We accept the fact that these things are lost, and quickly adapt to life without them. Just think… what a wealth to be found if one were able to recover what is lost.

Don’t be fooled, though - this isn’t inane conjecture. For the wanting man, there is indeed a way to stick your hand into the lucky dip, and wrench something back into existence, all for yourself. To keep.

To bind you.

As far as I can tell, there’s no one strict name for this ritual. Call it whatever you want - perhaps its true name has, too, been lost. The place you’ll be opening a gateway to, however, I’ve heard referred to mostly as the *Cellar*. Or the *Basement*, the *Crypt*, but at the end of the day, these are just labels, and aren’t conducive to getting what you want. What matters is that it’s the mausoleum of all things lost. If Hell is the absence of the light of God, then the Cellar is bereft of the light of reality itself - for what is lost, may as well not exist.

The constraints of our universe hold little sway there, and become as fluid as the ocean.

Before I get to the steps you’ll be following, and the risks posed to your wellbeing, it’s best to learn exactly what you’re going to need. Do NOT skip out on any of the following items:
* A candle. Well, you don’t need a candle and wick per se, just any wax you can melt by hand.
* A seal or mold of some kind. A signet ring is preferable, but the shape of the imprint you leave behind is mostly arbitrary - though I’d advise something circular, like a coin.
* A pair of bound objects. This can, really, be anything, although I’d advise going with something you probably couldn’t separate by hand; a pair of heavy chainlinks, for example.
* A driving tool, preferably a hammer and chisel.
* Human tears. Arguably the most difficult ingredient to procure in a sufficient amount, because not only do you need a good 10ml of the stuff to be safe, the tears cannot be those of pain. And no, you can’t cut an onion and expect those tears to work, nor can they be those of depression or despair. They must be tears of grief, for grief is the hoarse, wailing voice of the lost, and when you call out, you might get an answer.
* An heirloom of someone who has passed - even better if they were someone you were close with. A lover, a parent, a sibling, or a dear friend, just as long as you went through grief at their passing. Technically, this one is optional, but it sure as shit boosts your chances at a successful ritual.
* An offering. You don’t actually need to have it with you at the time, but make sure you have something important to you that can be put up for grabs.

You’ll also need to find a rift. Now, don’t overthink this. You don’t need to go to the grand canyon, and you don’t need to find a portal - you’ll already be making one, in essence. All that matters is that you’re able to pour wax into it: a crack, a split, hell, you could use a pothole if you’d like. Not recommended, though. No point in performing the ritual if you get turned into pate by a garbage truck halfway through.

And as these things always go, try to be somewhere away from the noise. No need for interruptions. In any case, the Gatekeeper will demand your full attention - you don’t want to lose in his game. I’ve seen what happens to those who do, and trust me, you’re better off slitting your neck on the spot.

One more thing before I teach you how to go rooting around in the Cellar: even with a perfectly executed ritual, risk still remains. In the Cellar, rules of reality are fluid, broken and rewritten every second, which you’ll remember from earlier if you have an attention span wider than the hairs on your head - if not, you shouldn’t be here at all.

When lost things are left to fester down there, they may serve as the base for a random, chaos-borne physical (or metaphysical) property that doesn’t exist up here. To avoid clunky lingo, you can think of them as curses. Cultures of conceptual mold and algae that cling fast to their host.

Yes, curses. Don’t let that word scare you away - a curse can just as easily be a blessing, depending on whose hands it falls into. You might retrieve a jar that perpetually rains tiny diamonds from no apparent source, or a teddy bear that imbues you with superhuman levels of confidence. But, you could also get a compass that kills any living creature on the direct opposite side of the Earth from you, or a fog machine that you can’t turn off, and drains your blood to vaporize into mist, regardless of where you are.

Because you are bound to it.

Now let's get to the steps:

First, find an isolated location and a hole or crack in the ground. Place the two linked objects on the left side of the hole, and if you’ve brought an heirloom of a dead loved one, place it on the right. You'll need enough wax to melt and pour to fill the cavity you’ve chosen. Bringing a portable stove or a blowtorch is ideal to melt a large quantity of wax at once. Pour the wax into the hole, and sprinkle it with the tears of grief you've obtained while it's still fluid. If the wax sets before you can add the tears, the ritual is over. Allow the wax to cool until malleable, then form an imprint with your stamping object of choice, like a signet ring.

You can take a break here while you wait for the second sigil to appear beside your imprint. Once it has fully formed, drive the chisel into it with the hammer, as deep as you can. When you feel it can't be pushed any further, twist the chisel in place. You should hear a distinct sound - really, you can't miss it. The gate is now unlocked and will open.

If you’re wondering why I’m sharing this information, the answer is simple. The more seekers, the more you and I stand to gain. And for those compelled to search for what they’ve lost can anyone hope to stop them? Might as well make sure they’re well-informed, so I’ve chosen to document my last dive into the Cellar. 

I chose an abandoned building on the outskirts of town where I was certain no one would interrupt. The moment I completed the ritual, a miasma began to spread and unfold from the cracked floor, and in the blink of an eye I was plunged into the depths. The first thing to greet me was the Gatekeeper. 

Though his appearance can change, he most commonly takes the form of a decrepit old man covered in sores and scabs. His robes might’ve once been regal but now they were tattered and filthy. He wore a rusted battered crown and carved into his forehead, weeping and scarified was the word “KING.”

You cannot enter or leave the Cellar without a wager and challenge. You get to set some parameters for the challenge, so play to your strengths. If you’re smart, you can ask for a game of riddles or logic; if you’re athletic, you can ask for a test of strength or stamina. I always chose a game of hide and seek where I had to avoid capture for a period of time set by the Gatekeeper. I was good at it, and had always emerged from the Cellar unscathed. 

As for the wager, what you stand to lose can’t be trivial. Could be your ability to walk, a loved one, even your life… Now before him, as I had done every time, I wagered the thing I value most. With empty eyes and a ravenous smile, he let me pass.

The Cellar always looks different and varies from person to person; you might find yourself in an ancient library stretching into infinity, every bookshelf lined with items long lost, or in an endless prairie with artifacts scattered about at random. Maybe it's a metaphysical space, partly shaped by your mind, I don't know. Just a theory. This time it was a dingy thrift store consisting of narrow corridors that wound and twisted around themselves to create a multi-story tangle of shelves, junk piles, and showrooms of old furniture. The air was rank, each inhale an acrid sting, and the lighting was dim orange.

A draft snaked its way through me, sinking bitter cold fangs into my bones, being here was a small agony unto itself. But the endless possibilities of what I might find drove me forward. I rummaged through some piles of lost things and found the usuals. A metric ton of socks, countless kitchen utensils, old photos, and anything else you can think of. 

I’ve found ancient lost tomes and scrolls if you care to parse lost knowledge and mysticism. The only caveat is that they're all in long-dead languages. Relics and archaeological treasures are common too but I’ve never had any interest in them. Then there are the cursed objects, the ones almost all seek. You know when you’ve found one, the air is poisoned with a rancid odor and malice radiates outwards from them. Holding one in your hand should feel wrong, and deeply unsettling. Your blood runs cold, your chest tightens and your stomach twists itself into knots. You’ll ask yourself what the hell you’re doing here and what this thing is capable of. 

All I can say is if you choose to pocket a cursed item you need to be incredibly cautious and aware from that moment forward because God knows what it can do. They’re unpredictable so carrying one around for an extended amount of time is a gamble and here time is inconstant and ever-shifting. 

The one I found on this trip was a silver pendant with a black gemstone at its center. I snatched it and quickly and cautiously snaked around an aisle toward a new room. That’s the trick, never linger too long and always be on the move. There are things here… I don’t know what they are. Maybe they’re searching too or maybe they're part of the lost. But they’re never friendly, so try not to spend too long in any one area, five minutes maximum and move on.

Looping back around to a room to search again is improbable since this realm is prone to shifting and warping around. Which is why multiple trips are common amongst those who delve. I want to say it gets easier every time but consistently something new reveals itself to me, always malicious.

This time, winding around a corridor into a larger chamber, it was a black room. As in the light here was negative, inverting every color. My eyes strained and my head thrummed at the sight so I pivoted around to leave and find another way through. But things never go to plan in this place.

I froze at the threshold, pivoted to look behind me and glimpsed it for a mere moment as it ducked behind an alabaster wall. Tendrils like wisps of black smoke coiled out of sight. Stalker. I’d rather face the negative room and its unknown than an abyssal stalker and so I turned back around and stepped into the anti-light. 

The darkstone pendant shone with a warm, greenish-yellow light in the black room, like a luminescent moss. Examining it more closely as I turned it in my shaking hand, a surge of recognition hit me of a sudden: a New England beach town, my first love. Mariel. 

We’d decided to take a trip there for a few days in fall during college, and she’d given it to me as a memento of our first trip together. A small hunk of some glassy, black material, probably onyx or obsidian, with a thin, red fissure running through it, all hung on a delicate silver chain, as tenuous as love itself. A heart had been carved or chipped into the black stone, the red stripe coursing through its center.

It had gotten misplaced some months later in our apartment, the loss sparking our first row. First of many, truth be told. In my mind, this fight was linked to our inevitable (and, to my mind - wholly avoidable) breakup. But, the bond we shared, Mariel and I, had been broken. What happened to her after we split was not something I could let my mind delve into - too much to do right now to let that distract me, and fear made me stay on task in this unnatural place.

If lost items took on an infectious, almost fungal nature here in this moldy place of living nightmares…what would happen if I moved *deeper*? Could it be reversed? Could the depraved, parasitic nature of the lost things become…a thing of hope? Or reunion? I dare not wish for such a thing. Mariel was lost to me and it was folly to think she should ever become mine once again. For if she did, would she be the same as I once knew her, pale and kind, sweet as a bud in spring? Or would the trickery and deception of this dank place transmogrify her into something inhuman? I didn’t have the time, or the wits, to think on it further,

I pocketed the charm and listened for the spectral being I had seen in the alabaster room. Was this being the Gatekeeper I had heard of when I first learned of how to unseal and delve into this forbidden place? Or was it something worse, and far more defiled, that dwelled below the Cellar?

Though I may have heard a faint scraping sound, no lumbering beast appeared, nothing slouched towards Bethlehem to be born, so I crept onward on tremulous legs. As I left the black room, I noticed a small group of moths flying away from it on dusty wings. It was *that* dark.

The next room was again lined with shelves, brick walls dancing with candle light. The shelves sagged with row upon row of dusty books, ornate sketches of unholy words in rolls, small jade figurines, dozens or hundreds of other items. The light in here was of the same quality as the obsidian pendant gave off in the black room; warm, slightly yellow, a shade of sickly green mixed in. This room in the old shop smelled of candlesmoke and old paper - a smell I had always loved, since my family ran a small bookstore in Virginia. Alongside this familiar smell was one of corruption, acidic rot, a foul sense of loneliness and abandonment. I think the fact that the Cellar plucks relevant ideas from your life to construct its space was what made it form this room for me, but it added its own hint of malice alongside it.

As I explored this new space, I was acutely aware of a sudden drop in temperature and my skin broke out in a rash of goosebumps, my armhair standing erect. Nothing moved in the shadows, but I was aware that I was once more not alone, and the feeling unnerved me. A soft sweeping sound, fabric moving against rough brick, perhaps, seemed to emanate maliciously from behind me. I glimpsed another of those smoky tendrils as it slowly crawled across the floor and curled around my ankles, like an evil cat cozying up to you in a cursed bodega.

The brick room seemed to go only up - the short hallway I was in ended in another brick wall, two wrought-iron sconces holding dripping, flickering candles. The ceiling seemed impossibly far away, disappearing into a foul gray mist hundreds of feet up; no escape there. I scoured the shelves for anything that might aid me in evading the cursed definitely-not-a-bodega-cat creature. 

The sibilant sound intensified slightly behind me, and more dark, malevolent spirals appeared on the floor. I rifled through the items on the shelves hurriedly; a hunk of greenish glass, cracked and crazed, that seemed to glow subtly in the dimly-lit room; a cloth child’s doll, string hanging where the button-eyes had been plucked out, rough black thread sewing the red gash of a mouth shut. The last one made my bowels shake with fear, though I could not have confessed why, even if I was held at knifepoint.

The temperature dropped a few more degrees and a tremulous shiver ran through me. As I sifted through the items on the rough, wooden shelves, my shaking hand closed on something even colder than the room itself; a strange chrome hammer with a very small head and a long handle, the word FREEMAN stamped on it. Sitting next to it was a long, sharp metal object, ending in a small, flat blade with a mean edge. It was about the size of a standard household screwdriver, but this was nothing you’d ever find in your old man’s toolbox, even if he did handiwork in Hell. *Danvers State Mental Hospital: Ward 9* had been etched into the haft of the object. 

A thought began to form in the back of my mind.

*What if I…*

*No,* I countered (myself) - *It won’t work - it’s utter madness.*

My reveries were interrupted by an intensification of the sound behind me and a thickening of the black fog, now swirling around my knees. My fear swelled and deepened.

Moving quickly, I grabbed the small hammer and screwdriver-looking object. I approached the brick wall, the dark, swirling shapes now seeming to tug at me. My legs felt the way they do in bad dreams, as if walking through switchgrass or wading in deep water. I reached up for one of the candles, lifted it out of the sconce with trembling hands and leaned in to examine the wall. 

*There. *

A small fissure in the mortar between bricks. The bricks on either side of the crack stuck out just enough to make a small shelf. The rift was no larger than a pencil, but it would have to do. 

Now, I know there are rules here in the Cellar, and I know I don’t have all the requisite items with me. But, perhaps, I had enough of them. Perhaps the fact that everything… *changes* down here, that even this place doesn’t follow its own rules, might let me bend whatever guidelines there were just enough that I could pull it off. 

A thought came to me in this dank and mildewed place, filling me with a new species of fear: what lies *beyond* the Cellar? 

I quickly separated the black pendant from the silver chain and hung the chain to the right of the crack. The rough, uneven bricks provided enough purchase that the tiny chain could be suspended, although the grip was tenuous at best. (*Much like my current grip on reality*, I thought). The pendant itself would have to serve as the seal. 

Another quick scan of the shelves turned up nothing that could be described as anything linked. No chains, no cufflinks, no…

*Hold up.*

I quickly snapped two links from the silver pendant chain and held them in my shaking palm. In all my years of performing the ritual, I had never seen anything so small, so pathetic. But, it was all I had. I put them on a wee outcropping of brick to the left of the crack, carefully so as not to drop them, although my quivering hands meant that I had to try three times before they settled into their place. They looked as small and as fragile as two hummingbird eggs.

The black smoke twisted and grabbed around my waist as I tipped the candle and dripped the wax into the small void between bricks. I completed the next steps of the ritual and stepped back.

And waited. 

Nothing happened. 

I don’t know if my half-assed version of the ritual didn’t work once you were already in the Cellar. Perhaps the linked items didn’t work, or the seal was wrong. Of if my thinking itself was wrong and the rules that applied in the world also applied down here, but I didn’t have time to find out. 

Whatever had been stalking me had just turned the corner, leaving me trapped in the brick-lined hallway as the black smoke seemed to turn solid and root me to the floor. 

I braced for the impact I knew was coming any second now. With the hammer in one hand, and that screwdriver thing in the other, I kept my eyes peeled on the fog. I was in flight or fight mode, and the flight option had been taken from me.

The scraping I’d heard earlier paled in comparison to what I was hearing now. The sound of the scraping was intensified, and beneath it was another sound entirely. It was a sound I’d only ever heard in movies, all squishy and fleshy. The kind of thing a foley artist would get from peeling off chunks of raw meat and rubbing  them together vigorously.

Next came the smell, all toxic and rotten. It made my eyes burn and water, clouding my vision. It burned my nose and throat, leaving a strange acidic taste in my mouth. Fear gripped my spine. Whatever this thing was had more or less disabled me and I hadn’t even seen it yet!

Just as that thought settled in my brain, it slowly emerged from the fog before me. No description I can provide here will truly do it justice, though I’ll do my best.

It was all tea leaves and Rorschach to me. Shapes that should make sense to my brain, but for whatever reason weren’t. Its structure was somewhere between melted wax and slime, so even if some semblance of shape was briefly recognizable it was always shifting.

The only thing that made sense was its mouth, as far as enormous rotting maws full of goo dripping razors made sense anyway. Unable to focus on the rest of its face, that’s what I stared at. 

So, there I stood, unable to move and facing my impending doom. In that moment, I did what any sane person would do in that situation…I pissed myself. Most of it was from fear, but there was a tiny little voice on my head that insisted it was in defiance. If it was going to eat me, the least I could do was make myself smell and taste less appealing.

It scraped and oozed its way ever closer, until it was standing directly in front of me. It places ruined and vaguely hand-shaped things on my shoulders and leaned in. The tea leaves and Rorschach shifted again, this time creating some semblance of a face as its structure hardened.

Two endless pits appeared where eyes would have been in a normal face. From them seeped the same greenish-yellow light I’d seen earlier. Two slits appeared below them as it leaned in to sniff me. 

Suddenly, my senses returned to me, I raised the hammer and… I’m going to start calling this thing a pick now. Typing the words screwdriver thing just isn’t doing it for me. So, yeah, I raised the hammer and the pick as it leaned in. I quickly positioned the pick in the center of its forehead and slammed the hammer down on the flat edge of it, driving that pick right into the creature’s brain.

With the lobotomy achievement unlocked, I took a moment to breathe. I’d done it! I’d…made it angry. Its mouth opened wider and a roar ripped from its throat with all the effects of a concussion grenade. My hearing was shot and my brain was acting like I was under water. My feet suddenly came free from the floor and I stumbled backwards and fell onto my ass.

It continued to roar as it moved forward, slime still dripping from the razors in its mouth. My ears were ringing so hard I couldn’t even hear the scrape and squish from earlier. I scooted backwards until my back hit a wall. There was nowhere left to go.

Closer it came, looming over me now. The slime coated my face as I stared up into that roaring maw. I could feel it burning my skin. I lost myself in the endless pools of sickly light as I waited to die. 

The hand-like shapes grabbed my ankles and tugged hard as it turned, dragging me behind it. I could feel every crack of the uneven floor as it tore my clothes and scraped my skin. I ditched the hammer, useless without the pick still stuck in the creature’s skull. I was on the lookout for anything I might be able to use when I noticed the pendant and its broken chain. I palmed it, chain and all, as I slid by it.

On we went, it dragged me through the maze of rooms and corridors to some mysterious destination. Some floors were smoother than others, and for those sections I was thankful. My clothing was being quickly reduced to shreds, and if this journey went on much longer I feared the same would happen to my flesh.

I’d seen things that might be useful as we went, but nothing that was within my reach. The creature never stopped, and there was no way to increase my height while in a constant state of movement. I managed to hold the pendant above my head. It glowed much more strongly now, and it illuminated the creature dragging me away. Except, what I saw was not a monster. A frail, naked woman, gripping me with impossible strength. Just before I gave up and closed my eyes, she turned to me, and the fraction of a second my eyes remained open was enough for me to recognise the face that stared back. And good God, it scared my brain blank.

By the time it released its grip on me, we’d just entered an area that emanated pure darkness. With the sheer amount of pain I was in, I almost didn’t realize the pressure around my ankles was disappearing. The floor here was smooth and cold, soothing my aches just enough to sober me, but not enough to take them away.

I stayed that way for a while. It’s impossible to say how long I was laying there in the darkness. My hearing was slowly getting back to being useful, and I neither heard nor felt any sign of the creature’s presence now. Eventually, the adrenaline fled my system and the pain took over completely. 

Just as my eyelids began to droop from sheer exhaustion, a bright light flooded the room and nearly blinded me. It shocked me awake and I scrambled to get my legs beneath me. I turned to look around the room on wobbly legs, trying to determine from which direction the danger would come from next.

As my eyes adjusted, the light seemed to dim and become stained with the same tint I’d seen in the creature’s eyes - sickly, sallow green. The first thing I could identify was far above me. Hanging, like a chandelier from a ceiling drenched in shadow, was a black moon. Beams of glowing midnight fanned out from it, revealing that the Cellar’s structural elements were gone. Only one structure stood before me.

A great podium of pockmarked ashen rock, perhaps basalt, rose about three stories high, with a spiraling staircase hewn from it, coiling to the very top. The tower rested on nothing, and a sudden wave of vertigo took me when I noticed chunks and chips from the tower, suspended in motion below it, below where I was standing, as if God had pressed pause at the moment of its ruin and forgotten to press play again.

Placed on the flat peak of the tower, sunworn with most of its spindles either snapped or missing, was a chair. Maybe oak, but it was too far gone to tell. And atop *that*, resting in the chair as if it were a notice of reservation, I saw a battered crown. A crown better fit for melting down than to be worn with any dignity. And yet, past the ugly skin of it, I sensed temptation, so deep and eternal it inspired an almost primal sense of want - no, better yet, *need*. I *had* to have it, without being sure why.

On the periphery of this void space, I detected movement. Figures wreathed in dark, shifting and shuddering. I had no fear, I simply ignored them and approached the bottom of the stairs, entranced.

A few steps, and I hissed in pain. My palm burned. The pendant, yes, I’d managed to grab it while being ferried to this place. Now, in the presence of the black moon above, it radiated both light and searing heat. I threaded the broken chain through the loop affixed to the pendant and held it up in front of me.

*Like an oil lantern*, I thought.

The light… it had a special quality about it. I remembered how it illuminated the creature’s face, and–

My skin flushed. No, that wasn’t real. A trick of the mind, of the light in the Cellar. That’s all. That reasoning was made ever more flimsy when I shone the pendant on the tower. It looked different in the light. At first I was unable to distinguish what stood before me, so I took a few steps back.

A skeleton. Two skeletons, in fact, entangled in death. The first and largest of the two appeared to be that of an enormous, winged humanoid, an outstretched hand serving as the chair in which the crown was nestled. The second was that of an equally massive serpent, coiled around the first skeleton, its head trapped beneath the winged humanoid’s reaching hand.

I hadn’t appreciated the thick silence until it was broken. A voice rang out, saying,

“Is one such as thee so uncaring, or simply aloof?”

Without needing to see its source, I knew exactly who that voice belonged to.

“Nope. Just bored and curious.”

The voice erupted into a dry cackle, and the void moon in the sky pulsed in rhythm. I tore free a hanging shred from my shirt, all ripped up thanks to that creature, and used it to swaddle the pendant, muffling the sight of the two skeletons. Again, I saw a stone tower, and I promptly made my way to the staircase and began to ascend.

I soon reached the top, a plateau that suggested the tower had once been much taller, but at some point, was cleaved apart. I tried not to think of what could have possibly done such a thing, instead turning my attention to the chair.

It was occupied. Sitting in it was a man, facing away from me, wearing that same battered crown. The tattered ribbons of his robes seemed to float, as if underwater, and parted to make way as I rounded the chair to stand in front. The man’s eyes looked so empty. The scars on his forehead spelling the word “KING” wrinkled in a scowl, and those eyes remained unfocused as he spoke again.

“At least you know now.”

“Know what?” I replied.

“That this is all there is. You can go no further. There is nothing beyond this accursed tomb. Regardless, you did something you should not have. Did you come here with a death wish?”

“I…”

The gravity of the situation came crashing down. Here I was, in the Gatekeeper’s domain, utterly helpless to do anything but listen as his voice emerged again like crackling embers, reignited by the wind.

“There, in thine hand. You cannot hide it from me, you know.”

I stuttered, fighting for air. At this, the Gatekeeper’s lips stretched into a cracked and inflamed smile.

“What else? Is this fool dissatisfied with his new plaything?”

“Yeah,” I said, surprised by my own aplomb, “I guess I’m looking for something else. Rest assured, this here pendant is the only thing I’ll be leaving with, physically speaking.”

His smile fell to a smirk, accompanied by a cocked eyebrow.

“And again I ask; art thou without empathy, or simply lacking sense? You would stand there, in front of *me*, whilst the wager is in *my* hand, and think nothing of it?”

“But I haven’t lost yet, have I?”

“You were going to leave with… show me.”

I shielded the cloth-wrapped pendant from view.

“Why?”

“I beseech thee, *show me*!”

Reluctantly, I extricated it from the layers of cloth, and presented the pendant, chain and all. On seeing it, the Gatekeeper devolved back into a rasping chuckle.

“Ah, that. How coincidental!”

“How so?” I asked cautiously.

“Thy wager, maggot. That which you love most, and hold most dear to thy glassen little heart. Do not deceive thyself; you saw her, didst thou not? That pendant is a special relic indeed.”

I knew exactly what he was talking about. That creature…

“I… I saw… I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Immediately, all the smugness dropped from his face. His sore-ridden skin contorted with anger, lined by warty ridges. He shot up from the chair, a way that didn't seem to utilize three dimensions. Made my head hurt. It was as if he’d vanished and materialized standing face-to-face with me. He spoke in a growl of controlled wrath.

“Oh? Hast thine eyes become foggy? Then let it be made clear: last time, I let you believe you won. *You did not*. Thus, the wager for this visit - being the same one you’ve used every time - was, how to put it… expired. What– *who* you love most. Well, *loved* most.”

The Gatekeeper threw his head back and snorted. The very thing I hadn’t wanted to accept crawled down my throat and settled in my stomach, heavy as molten lead, and shrouding my head in a contradictory haze of confused clarity. Then, the Gatekeeper made my fears into reality.

“Oh Mariel! Be a dear and come up for tea.”

Out there in the shadows, one of the shifting figures changed. It crept into the light, became more real somehow. I didn’t turn to look. I couldn’t. Whether it was from some occult force or sheer terror, my muscles wouldn’t budge an inch.

But I could hear it. Wet, frictional, and strangely manufactured, a sound hailing an overpowering stink, growing stronger with every encroaching step, mustard gas, rotten eggs. My eyes began to water from the stench.

My arm rose up with a mind of its own, directing the pendant towards the top of the stairs. Black moonlight burned darker still to resonate with it, invigorating it, and bathing the newly emerged figure in light. For a moment, a fraction of a second, it was all Rorschach and swirling tea leaves again. Teeth like stalactites dripped with secretions below a pair of deep, glowing pits.

The creature entered the light, and stopped.

She looked so, so unhappy. Standing there, naked and withered, all her hair, gone. Her teeth too, leaving behind rotten, puffy gums. Only one eye had been plucked out - not because of any mercy, no. It was more like a punchline. A perverted joke. But one eye was all she needed to convey a kind of anger I’d never seen before. A kind of anger that needed no coal to fuel it. A kind of anger that can never be extinguished. If it weren’t for her emaciated body, she’d have flown into a rampage - and even if she could, no catharsis would ever be enough. She’d have torn me to shreds, she’d have skinned my mother alive in front of me and still it wouldn’t be enough. I barely felt the tears streaming down my cheeks under the scrutiny of that single eye.

*Tears right for the ritual*, I thought.

I tried to speak, to say anything at all, but my throat was tight shut. Either way, the Gatekeeper was satisfied.

“I may be one to withhold information, but I am no more a liar than you are honest to thyself.”

He paused to gaze at her. At my love. At the thing I valued most, and it really hit me then. The magnitude of what I’d lost. Not just Mariel, but my trust in… everything. Gone.

“Okay, Mariel. That will be plenty from thee.”

With a flick of his wrist, the Gatekeeper sent her tumbling through the air, off the tower, and back into the dark, where she will remain until the stars themselves are lost.

“Worms, the lot of them. They don’t understand the purpose of this place, of why it was made. Of what it houses. It is something demons covet, and that God sent angels seeking for. Do you seek it, sojourner?”

I felt whatever force that held me in place lift from my body, and I wheeled around to face the Gatekeeper again, staring him down with my smoldering indignance. The pendant, as if empathizing, flared, bright as a tungsten filament, more than enough to illuminate the face of the man before me - and his, too, was a facade.

Gone was his giddy rictus, bloated with greed and derision. The eyes now staring deep into my own were dour and heavy  - not with wrath, but misery. It made Mariel look quite comfortable by comparison. It was the face of the first to grieve, of one whose eyes have cried themselves dry as salt.

His voice underlined that sentiment. A withered croak that told of ancient ruins lost beneath desert sand and, above all, sounded unequivocally honest.

“I… it is no treasure they seek. Power it is not, nor any blessing of the sort. I have been its keeper for… since… I don’t know. Too long.”

The Gatekeeper laughed, but it was hollow and came out more as a flurry of gasps.

“Do you want to know?”

A cold chill flushed my entire body. I know the right choice would’ve been, “no,” but the only thought running through my mind was, “*I’ve come this far*.”

So I nodded.

“What could have such value, that God Himself cannot already conjure? Well, in a way, He did create it. But it was an accident. A side-effect, a natural byproduct of the creation of something that lives on to this day, something that continues to exist within all of His children on Earth. It is the shadow of that, and also the relinquishment of it. I speak with you now freed from its grasp - the one you have been speaking with is not me. I do not– *cannot* control this vessel. I can only observe as it acts on its own.”

“Just tell me!” I yelled, not out of impatience, but mounting terror. The Gatekeeper continued as if he hadn’t heard me.

“ I still don’t understand why it does the things it does. It shouldn’t be doing anything, because it is the anti-will. The shadow of agency, the counterpart that was necessary to be born to allow the freedom of choice, the very same you used to decide to visit this place. I don’t know what that pendant is, but oh, it is good to breathe again. To speak. The ones who covet the anti-will… perhaps I’m too small and insignificant to comprehend their motives. Why, God? Why would you want to abandon yourself? Please, my friend, you have to free me, you–”

I’d heard enough. In one shaky motion I drew back the pendant, and no sooner had I stashed it away than the Gatekeeper leapt at me, all his rage and hunger returned. I understood now. The entity before me was impossible, and yet here it was. The emptiness where a will should be, not only acting by itself, but grabbing me by the throat to pull me in close.

“Answer me! Wilt thou, or wilt thou not?”

I strained to force words past cold fingers tightening around my windpipe.

“W-what? Will I what?”

“*DAREST THOU TEST ME!?*”

Had some hidden conversation taken place when I was speaking with the Gatekeeper - the *real* one? Had something been asked of me? I didn’t have time to rationalize, all I knew was my vision was turning black, so I did all I could think of to release myself.

“Yes, okay, yes I will, I–”

With that, he let go, spilling me onto the ground where I clawed at my throat and gasped for air.

“Very well. Thou hast come far, and so I bestow upon thee this gift. Remember, one thing at a time, so I will be taking this. Don’t be greedy.”

He bent down and snatched the pendant, still glowing dimly. Without pause, he straightened, and pointed a finger directly upwards, at the black moon hanging above. On cue, it burst like a popped water balloon, raining a supernova of shadow down on my shivering body. I felt the ground disappear from under my hands. I rose, up and up towards an empty filament, and with one final glance, I saw the Gatekeeper. The power released from the shattered moon reinvigorated the pendant and it shone on his face. That tired, eternally tortured face. It was smiling. His body seemed to decay in time lapse into flakes, flittering away in an unfelt breeze. With the last vestiges of his strength, I heard him whisper something that sounded like,

“Thank… you… from the bottom of my heart…”

A dark tunnel filled with blinking lights - or eyes - and the sensation of something worming its way inside my body.

Then, I was back. Back in the abandoned building on the outskirts of town. I checked myself, no pendant, as I expected. Was the Gatekeeper telling the truth? The anti-will? I didn’t understand. Had I reAlly bEEn givEN ~~THE DEATH OF CHOICE???~~

~~STOP THIS~~ I suppose the Gatekeeper must have punished me for breaking the rules, and forced me to leave empty-handed. Yes, that’s it; empty-handed.

Now, most of you reading will have thought by now: why share this experience? How does it provide any significant insight into the ritual itself?

I think it’s as simple as being prepared. Would you go skydiving without seeing some footage beforehand? Would you tempt the wolves, not knowing their predilections? If so, well, fools are still welcome in the Cellar, but it’s more fun when there’s a challenge.

I’m running out of time. If I want to get this out there, it needs to be done now. I’ve inherited such a ~~terrible curse~~ wonderful gift, and what is a game without the gamemaster?

So come on, plunge your hands into the lucky dip, take your pick and ~~GET OUT LET ME OUT~~ go home a little richer. Or perhaps you’ve lost something - in which case, I know just the place to search, so come and take back what is rightfully yours. Or something that isn’t. ~~THIS IS NOT M~~ Serendipity, I say.

I look forward to the fun we are going to have.

Whether it’s a retail store, office building, or industrial complex, the cleanliness and appearance of commercial spaces significantly impact customer perception and employee morale. This is where the power of professional cleaning services, including power washing and commercial cleaning, comes into play. Check out: [**parking lot cleaning Hagerstown MD**](https://hagerstownpowerwashing.com/)

These services not only ensure a pristine environment but also contribute to a healthier and more inviting workspace.

The Importance of Commercial Cleaning: Maintaining a clean and tidy commercial space is crucial for several reasons:

1. Health and Safety: Cleanliness directly affects the health and safety of employees and customers. A clean environment reduces the risk of accidents, minimizes the spread of illnesses, and promotes overall well-being.

2. Enhanced Productivity: A clutter-free and organized workspace fosters productivity among employees. Studies have shown that workers are more focused and efficient in clean environments, leading to better performance and higher morale.

3. Professional Image: A clean and well-maintained commercial space reflects positively on the business’s reputation. It conveys professionalism, attention to detail, and a commitment to quality, which can attract customers and instill confidence in stakeholders.

4. Longevity of Assets: Regular cleaning helps preserve the longevity of furniture, fixtures, and equipment. By removing dirt, dust, and grime, commercial cleaning services prevent premature wear and tear, ultimately saving businesses money on repairs and replacements.

The Power of Power Washing: Power washing, also known as pressure washing, is a highly effective method for deep cleaning exterior surfaces. Visit here: [**dumpster pad cleaning Hagerstown MD**](https://hagerstownpowerwashing.com/)

· Exterior Maintenance: Over time, exterior surfaces accumulate dirt, algae, and pollutants, detracting from the building’s appearance. Power washing can rejuvenate these surfaces, restoring their original luster and curb appeal.

· Preventative Maintenance: Regular power washing can prevent the buildup of contaminants that can lead to structural damage. By removing debris and organic growth, such as mold and mildew, power washing helps prolong the life of exterior surfaces and prevents costly repairs.

· Health and Safety Compliance: Cleanliness extends beyond indoor spaces; it’s also essential for the exterior of commercial properties. Power washing ensures compliance with health and safety regulations by eliminating hazards such as slippery surfaces and mold growth.

· Enhanced Property Value: A well-maintained exterior enhances the overall value of a commercial property. Whether it’s attracting potential tenants or impressing clients, a clean and inviting exterior can positively impact property value and investment returns.

The Role of Commercial Cleaning Services: Commercial cleaning services encompass a wide range of tasks designed to maintain cleanliness and hygiene in commercial spaces. These services are tailored to the specific needs of each client and often include:

· Routine Cleaning: Daily or periodic cleaning of floors, surfaces, restrooms, and common areas to ensure a tidy and sanitized environment.

· Janitorial Services: On-site janitorial staff responsible for trash removal, restocking supplies, and general maintenance tasks to keep the premises clean and orderly.

· Green Cleaning: Eco-friendly cleaning practices using non-toxic products and sustainable techniques to minimize environmental impact and promote a healthier indoor environment.

Conclusion: Power washing and commercial cleaning play integral roles in maintaining the cleanliness, safety, and appeal of commercial properties. From enhancing curb appeal and protecting exterior surfaces to fostering a healthy and productive indoor environment, these services offer numerous benefits for businesses of all sizes. By investing in professional cleaning services, businesses can create a positive impression, safeguard their assets, and create a conducive environment for success.

I went to see a dermatologist and my pcp and ran an entire panel to make sure everything was in check and nothing came abnormal out. I had been reading about Vitamin A toxicity and thought this might be causing the issue.
I take cod liver oil daily which has vitamin A and adding topical Vitamin A maybe was too much. I abandoned the new routine. The round bald spot got smaller and smaller, but I still have a little spot that has not grown back.

**Let’s Find Out The Transformative Power of Key Components of Awaken XT!**

The incredible effects of Awaken XT completely depend upon its components. Here are some active ingredients that you can get in this formula:

**Chaga Mushroom**

It is also known as Inonotus obliquus which has been utilized for centuries especially in traditional medicine, particularly in some parts of Asia and Siberia. This is a remarkable fungus enriched with bioactive compounds like antioxidants and polysaccharides that provide a wide range of potential health advantages.

Its main ability is to support the liver as well as the detoxification process of the organ. By improving liver function, this component helps in eliminating and breaking down toxins and allows the liver to function perfectly.

Such restoration of liver health may lead to boosted digestion and well-being. Additionally, it is also a potent immune system enhancer that includes beta-glucans and it may regulate the entire immune response. By improving immunity, Chaga contributes to the natural defense mechanisms of your body against harmful substances and toxins.

**Amla Extract**

“Indian gooseberry” is another name of the product and it is enriched with vitamin C and antioxidants. These incredible properties make it such a valuable addition among the population. Because of antioxidants, this ingredient protects against oxidative stress and damage caused by toxins.

In addition, vitamin C included in the ingredient can improve the immune system, and boost the body’s defense workings against toxins and infections.

**Chlorella Powder**

It is a kind of freshwater algae that comes with detoxifying properties. In addition, this green superfood is enriched in chlorophyll which not only provides its vibrant shade but also serves as a powerful detoxifying agent.

Generally, chlorella plays an important role in kidney health and supports the kidneys in filtering waste supplements from the bloodstream. By encouraging the efficient functioning of kidneys, this component helps to ensure that toxins are eliminated from the body instead of accumulating.

**Turmeric**

With its active and amazing compound curcumin, turmeric is renowned for its anti-inflammatory properties. Generally, inflammation is a common consequence of toxin exposure and chronic inflammation may lead to several health issues.

By decreasing inflammation, turmeric assists in mitigating the harmful effects of toxins on the organs and systems of the body. Also, it contributes to overall health by encouraging a balanced inflammatory response.

**Burdock Powder**

It is also called Arctium lappa which is a root vegetable and it has been utilized in traditional medicine for its potential detoxification properties. It is enriched with antioxidants that help to deal with oxidative stress and decrease the burden on the liver.

This also includes dietary fiber that may help in the discarding of waste and toxins from the entire body. Along with supporting natural detoxification procedures of the body, this ingredient contributes to entire well-being.

20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bq6uc1,Help! Green/blue algae explosion! Anyone have suggestions?,"So my fish bred and I don’t know if they created more waste or what but this algae started. I cleaned the tank regularly and put in the algae fix and the quick start, but it just kept coming back.

I do regular water changes, removing half the water or more, still didn’t fix it.

So I did a full reset. Emptied the tank, cleaned it, scrubbed the faux wood decorations, wiped the plants, completely replaced the substrate (it was sand, I replaced with pebbles).

Still the algae persists. It killed my baby fish. I don’t know what else to do so I’m hoping the Reddit gods can save me and my fish.",28 Mar 2024 17:11:05
21,https://i.redd.it/lh0vzdm0n4rc1.png,I'm on earliest stages of building my world. And I need several thoughts,"Hi there! You may think that this is an image of ancient eldritch horror but, actually, it is a map. Well, a sketch of a map of my fantasy world (part of it). But if your eyes start bleeding after you see this image - I think it's a compliment for me! Ok. So, white is ground, black is water. For context - this sketch was prepared for Wonderdraft, so this is a reason for such an interesting choice of color.

Oh, and I should say that I already made a post with this map more than a year ago, but I was lazy enough all that time to make nothing with it. Plus my doubts. Plus overthinking. Plus bad ideas that I couldn't reject for quite  a long time.. Though, I decided to return to that project and make something already.

Well, the main reason why I’m making this post is because I want to know if my ideas are interesting enough for people. And I have some ideas that I think are questionable.  I need someone's clear sight. So, all this long text is quite a boring bunch of facts about Akuma - my fantasy world. First of all - Akuma means ""evil spirit"" or ""devil"" in japanese. I suggest, this is the perfect name for this planet.

This planet is the third moon of a brown dwarf, and I can call it ""moon"" because the brown dwarf itself orbits a red dwarf star making this star system binary. There are three planets between red dwarf (RD) and brown dwarf (BD). RD is slightly heavier than half of the sun. BD has a mass of 54 Jupiters. All three planets between them are lighter than Earth. 

BD has six moons (or planets if you want). 5 of them are lighter than Earth, third is Akuma and 6 is, interestingly - a gas giant with moon. I made a model of this system in Universe Sandbox so it seems quite realistic despite being quite unlikely.

Well, I don't know of any real star system similar to it - no brown dwarf was found in such a strange configuration with a red dwarf. But I make it with purpose (!!!). Like, I want my fantasy world to be ""dark and spooky"" but I want it to be scientifically possible and still good enough for highly developed forms of life. Though most of its people evolved here good enough to live with all its ""spookiness'' without any problem. (Dark lighting from the planet's stars isn't the biggest problem). Forgot to say that Akuma has a mass of 77% of Earth.

So Akuma's environment is affected by both RD and BD. Needless to say that Akuma is tidally locked. And I work with half of the planet that can't see BD. So people here don't even know that they live on ""moon-like object"". Akuma's orbital period is 26 hours. The orbital period of BD around RD is 217 earthly days. 

While modeling in Universe Sandbox I make sure that Akuma's temperature is good enough for life, though in this model BD had an orbital period of 183 days. Well, it's slightly more than half of our year so I thought it was kinda boring. So I assumed that the effects of BD can expand the habitable zone for Akuma so I make BD's orbital period longer - 217 days. So Akuma's year is still lesser than Venus' year but its day is two hours longer than ours. 201 local days.

RD makes the sky on this planet reddish. And people here can see the brightest stars even during daytime. Scientists say that stars here might appear blue, but, well, if you were born in a red dwarf system and all your ancestors too, I suppose you wouldn't be able to see blue, green, and purple, and maybe all colors that are higher on the spectrum than orange and, maybe, yellow. You won't even know what it is.. It definitely creates some problems for my future writing…

Because of the red light, plants on Akuma are red or black. Plants' color depends on the environment and height, so some plants here are really brighty red and some are blacker than my soul. Like, plants in the mountains are red, because they need more protection from sunlight while plants in the lowest part of forest are quite black because for them catching sunlight is definitely uneasy. Well, I assume, there are no other specific effects of RD on the Akuma surface.

The impact of BD is interesting too. Every fucking day Akuma fluctuates. Because of BD's gravitation. You know, planets' orbits are not exactly round, so they have some part where they are closer to their parent object and part where it's farther. So to be short: every 26 hours of Akuma's day/night cycle (its orbital period) gravitation of BD stretches and squeezes it. Well, there is quite a big chance that in reality such a planet becomes hellish as Venus or Io...  

So BD's gravitation creates a lot of inner heat under Akuma's crust and this makes it warmer but consequence of it is quite wild tectonic activity. Volcanoes everywhere!!! And volcanic winters... sometimes. Earthquakes here and there... Such kind of stuff. Well, if you wondering why shape of continents on my map is such... strange, it is because of fucking BD's gravitation that plays with Akuma as dog with a ball. Plus I assume that gravitation of the nearest to Akuma planets have its effects too. And that creates unpredictable tides. Well...

Besides, BD has an electromagnetic field (EMF), and, considering the mass of BD I suggest that it's massive and powerful as fuck. Akuma is big enough to have its own EMF, and I suggest that interaction of two EMFs creates interesting effects. I just hope that they are not deadly for the planet's life and most importantly - intelligent life.

Well. BDs EMF protects Akuma from dangerous cosmic stuff and first of all - RD's solar storms. And aurora borealis everywhere!!! Sick waves of light across the skies almost everyday! I don't know if there can be some pattern of aurora's appearance so I just assume it's an unpredictable phenomenon. I think it's possible to see other similar phenomena here. I mean, phenomena with electromagnetic and/or electric nature. Ball lightning for example, sprites and so on. And that stuff is really frequent here. 

Because of the powerful presence of EMF it's quite hard to establish a high technological civilization on Akuma. Well, tbh it's impossible. Electromagnetic storms and stuff. It could look pretty in the skies but, you know, EMF kills all electronics here. I have plot trope with aliens that come to this planet long time ago and got fucked up by it. 

I suppose that local plant and animal life found some ways to use EMF for themselves. Like, for example, predators that can find prey by electric signals, or plants or mushrooms that use electromagnetic induction for its benefit.

Oh. I need to say that because of BD's EMF Akuma's polar regions are terrible for living. U know - it's like life in Chornobyl zone but worse. Polar regions are much more affected by EMF than others, so not many things can live here.

I suppose that the temperature of BD has some effect on Akuma too but, considering the nature of those objects and its evolution, I suggest, it's not so big. But, who knows? It's still quite a big relatively warm object, not an actual star though, but, well, it makes Akuma warmer than it could be.

And I have more!

Another distinctive feature of Akuma are its mushrooms. Giant mushrooms, actually. Well, I just slightly OBSESSED(!!!) with mushrooms so Akuma has different forms and types of them. 

I suppose I can justify its size by the environmental conditions of Akuma. You know, all those volcanoes release a lot of carbon material. CO2 at least. Mushrooms store it in their mycelium. Plus, well, maybe some of them have symbiotic relationships with some bacteria/cyanobacteria and/or lichen. And maybe volcanic emissions can be used by mushrooms quite well as ""food"". 

Mushrooms here create quite a wide and deep web of mycelium. I mean, this network may be stretching under the entire surface of the planet. This network is one of the main reasons why life is possible here despite all those shit as fucking volcanos with toxic gases and high as fuck greenhouse effect. I need to say that even in the earliest stages of worldbuilding when I didn't really know what kind of world I was trying to create, I had this idea of some ""World Tree"", though, ""dark"" variant of it. So this mycelium network is Akuma's ""World Tree"", Yggdrasil-like entity, though it is mushroom and it's mostly horizontal, plus kinda growing down - to the depths.

And now I go to the most problematic element of this world - this element is the main reason for my doubts and unproductive overthinking. Climate system of Akuma.

You know, our climate depends mostly on Earth's axis, so seasons exist because the axis is changing its incline through the year. Because of the short orbital period and strong gravitation of BD, the axial tilt of Akuma is 0. Maybe I should change the axial tilt of BD so it can change the orbital incline of all its satellites? Well, no. The orbital period of BD is shorter than Earth's, and its orbit is round almost perfectly because of it. I mean - seasonal changes on Akuma could still be quite unrecognizable even if BD has a bigger axial tilt. Plus - the big axial tilt of BD and its ""moons"" makes the whole system really unstable so everything just flies in different directions after several dozen years. 

Did I say I made modeling in Universe Sandbox?

So, our more ""traditional"" climate system doesn't work here on Akuma. I mean, in normal realistic conditions Akuma's climate is quite unchangeable, without seasons. Well, sometimes volcanic winter/s happens. Though it's unpredictable. And it's sooo boring!!! Fucking eternal summer!!! But I, seemingly, found a way!

Let's go back to the mushrooms! And to the volcanos! So, as it was said before, gravitation of BD makes Akuma fluctuate as accordion (?), because its orbit isn't perfectly round. That's create a lot of inner heat and more tectonic activity, volcanos and stuff. In turn that creates a greenhouse effect and fills the planet's atmosphere with a lot of CO2, methane and different toxic shit. 

And here mushrooms come into play! I mean - those fucking giant network of mycelium under Akuma's surface and ""normal"" mushrooms too absorb those gases, well, by using symbiotic organisms (bacteria, algae or lichen) or maybe by direct interaction of mycelium with plant roots... I don't know exactly how... 

This mycelium network protects the planet's lifeforms from dangerous greenhouse effect, stabilizes temperature and humidity and, possibly, recycles toxic elements of volcanic activity into something useful. And, moreover, mushroom-mycelium network creates seasonal changes. Somehow. And for some reason. 

I mean, this network has lifecycles that make its absorption (?) capacity sometimes worse and sometimes better so there is part of a year when greenhouse effect affects planet more and other part when it's not so bad. Well, mycelium lifecycles creates seasonal changes on Akuma. But I suppose this change is still not as drastic as Earth's so it looks like tropical seasons with small transition periods in-between. Ok. 

I hope all those bullshit is understandable enough. Akuma's climate system isn't simple. This is actually the main reason why I still can't make another step in my worldbuilding process. I need someone who can say something about it.

So, what do we have here? Planet in the strange star system, with reddish sky and red and black plants, with giant mushrooms all over the place. Volcanoes and different electromagnetic stuff happen here. And volcanic winters... Not the best place to live. If you think that this planet looks like Hell - you are right! It definitely is!

Well. That's not all. It is a fantasy setting and what a fantasy without magic? Yeap, there is magic here. Considering all BD's effects I suppose that local magic exists because of it. So here on Akuma a lot of anomalous places can be found. You know, all of this stuff with tectonic faults, ley lines, mysterious zones... So, polar regions are big fucking territories FULL of anomalies! 

All gods, spirits, demons and even souls could be considered as sentient anomalies. Well, I'm still thinking about magical stuff. I have an idea of ""Dreamlands"" or ""Dream realm"", and, well, it mostly exists in dreams (or mind) of... giant mycelium web! But almost nobody knows it. I'm not sure that fungi need sleep though... So a lot of magic is connected with sleep and dreams. But mostly with different electromagnetic shit. 

I can’t say much about Akuma’s magic system just because I still haven't come up with something interesting. 

I don't think it's time to speak about local races, history and cultures, because, again, I still have doubts about the most fundamental elements of this world. This is the reason why I made this post. Doubts. Overthinking. Inability to make any progress…

I hope that’s all is understandable enough. I have worked with this world since 2019 and most of the time was wasted on research and modeling. This was interesting work though, but it’s time to do something more and start write a fucking story! Well, firstly I need to build the world's history, cultures, and create interesting characters… Sometimes it’s all become quite frustrating. So. What do you think?",28 Mar 2024 15:31:40

 Water intrusion can happen due to various reasons, such as improper installation, insufficient maintenance, defective materials, cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof. Water can penetrate through these openings and reach the underlying layers of the roof, such as the insulation, the decking, and the framing.  

 

##### THIS CAN CAUSE MANY PROBLEMS, SUCH AS:

* **Reduced Energy Efficiency:** Water can lower the thermal resistance of the insulation, making the building lose heat in the winter and gain heat in the summer. This can increase the energy consumption and the utility bills of the building.
* **Damaged Equipment & Inventory:** Water can harm the equipment and the inventory stored in the building, such as electronics, machinery, furniture, and products. This can result in losses, repairs, or replacements, which can affect the productivity and profitability of the business.
* **Health & Safety Hazards:** Water can create a favorable environment for mold, mildew, bacteria, and fungi to grow and spread in the building. These can cause allergic reactions, respiratory infections, and other health issues for the occupants. Water can also weaken the structural integrity of the roof, making it prone to collapse or failure, which can endanger the lives and the property of the occupants.

&#x200B;

**BENEFITS OF WATERPROOFING IN COMMERCIAL ROOFING**

Commercial roofing needs to be waterproofed. Waterproofing is the process of applying a protective layer or coating on the roof that can prevent water from entering the roof and reaching the underlying layers. 

##### WATERPROOFING YOUR COMMERCIAL ROOF CAN PROVIDE MANY ADVANTAGES, SUCH AS:

1. Extending the lifespan of your roof by preventing deterioration and decay caused by water exposure.
2. Reducing the risk of leaks and moisture intrusion that can damage the interior of your building and its contents, as well as create safety and health issues for the occupants.
3. Enhancing the energy efficiency of your building by reducing heat loss and gain through the roof, lowering your cooling and heating costs.
4. Improving the aesthetic appeal of your building by preventing stains, discoloration, and algae growth on your roof surface.
5. Increasing the value of your property by maintaining its structural integrity and appearance.

&#x200B;

**LOW SLOPE ROOFING SYSTEM**

Commercial roofing needs to be waterproofed. Waterproofing is the process of applying a protective layer or coating on the roof that can prevent water from entering the roof and reaching the underlying layers. 

**SOME OF THE BEST OPTIONS FOR LOW-SLOPE ROOFING SYSTEMS ARE:**

 

**TPO (THERMOPLASTIC POLYOLEFIN)**

26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1bkmg30/quality_of_life_roleplay_suggestions/,Quality of Life / Roleplay suggestions!,"As I have started playing the game again after a hiatus, I noted some things that I think should be changed in the game and would like those willing to read a wall of text to give me their thoughts on some I propose:

1. Piracy - I'm under the impression that most people here would agree that piracy in its current state is annoying to deal with. Even with starbases equipped with weaponry (which reduce piracy along a certain distance) and mercantile traditions maxed, at higher trade values you are expected to dedicate a fleet of small ships to patrol important routes. I personally think that an empire government policy that taxes your alloy production by a small % when enabled  (Or energy if megacorp to represent private police) would be a better solution. Trade heavy empires would always have it on, while an empire that needs as many alloys as possible (war), or doesn't have much trade to begin with would not dedicate resources to it. This would buff gestalts slightly and  make trade empires less annoying to play in my opinion.
2. Planet Preferences / Segregation - I think you should be allowed to restrict certain species on certain planets (at least if you have resettlement allowed as your government policy, or are xenophobic). It's annoying to have pops move to a world they aren't suited or specialized for. For example, I was playing a wide empire with synthetic robots unlocked, and had the idea of settling robots on them. I would later find biological population on these tomb worlds, but plently of robot pops on ecumenopoli / ring worlds / gaia worlds. I would have to manually resettle them to other worlds instead. It also allows for roleplay purposes (Ie, multiple sectors with different species, representing autonomous regions. As an aside, it would be neat if that was actually a feature with different effects).
3. Influence to unsettle a planet recently conquered should be removed or reduced - Conquest in this game is enjoyable enough, but dealing with the AI's planets is the worst part of it. This would be made slightly less painful if it didn't cost 200 influence to unsettle a garbage planet the AI has on a completely unbuilt world. I think for a short time period (1 - 5 years after conquest), the influence cost should be lower, as its purpose is to prevent population growth via settling and unsettling, but this isn't a problem with conquest.
4. Multiple blocker technologies should be reduced - There are many blockers in the game, most of which need a unique (!!) technology to deal with. I think that these techs should be merged into one or just rolled into terrestrial sculpting (as it's bizarre to think that an empire could terraform entire planets before dealing with large glaciers, or toxic algae). This is even more relevant now with the recent technology nerfs, and the only use I have personally had with them is to reroll techs late game.
5. Colossus Shadow - This is not my original idea but I saw someone else suggest this. It would be neat if having a colossus over a planet severely increases emigration attractiveness, and decrease stability, happiness, governing ethics attraction, and possibly even have the planet surrender given the right circumstances (as it is even more pressing than orbital bombardment). This would give the colossus a more versatile use and be fun for roleplay.
6. Displacement Purge Opinion Malus - While I do use this purge option quite a bit, I've found it a bit funny that other empires throw a fit if you do any other type of genocide, but are perfectly fine (even the fanatic xenophiles) with you expelling presumably billions of individuals from their native region. I think there should be an opinion malus with caveats - maybe xenophobic empires don't care, or organics don't care about gestalt pops, or perhaps the opinion malus should just be far less severe than the other types of genocide. I would like to remind you that forced expulsion is considered a form of genocide by the UN, as far as I know.

&#x200B;

I think these are all reasonable and would improve the game, but again I'd love to hear the community's thoughts. I appreciate you if you read all of it.",21 Mar 2024 20:39:11

This is week 3 for me and I'm getting nervous.
I have an 8.75 gallon tank with a nerite and mystery snail (who are doing well). I have an organic plant mix covered by gravel, driftwood, rocks, cholla, and quite a few plants (red roots, water wisteria, anubias nana, anubias, dwarf baby tears, dwarf grass, java moss, vine moss, and one other whose name I cannot remember but they are very, very small so they barely matter. I have the aqueon shrimp filter (which I'm changing out to a sponge tomorrow as I think my red roots hate my current filter). I have the clip on plant light from aqueon as well.

I have done water tests frequently.. only last week did I test any ammonia and now all of my levels are 0 with a 7.6ph. I also did a 20% water change 2 days ago.

 Pretty much, my plants seem like they are on their way to dying. My floaters are melting, my anubias and wisteria are browning... I just don't want all of my $$ to go down the drain here nor have my snails in a toxic environment.

However, concerns persist regarding their efficacy in combating high levels of toxic pollutants, especially in industries like textiles notorious for their chemical-intensive processes.

To address these challenges, let's delve into five potent biological solutions tailored for mitigating extremely toxic pollutants in industrial wastewater:

1️⃣ **Bioremediation Techniques:** Harnessing nature's microorganisms, bioremediation employs bacteria, fungi, or algae to break down toxic compounds into harmless substances. Its adaptability allows for targeted treatment, aligning with eco-friendly principles.

2️⃣ **Constructed Wetlands:** Engineered wetland systems leverage natural processes to remove contaminants, utilizing microbial activity and plant uptake. Carefully curated ecosystems within these wetlands enhance water quality efficiently.

3️⃣ **Phytoremediation:** This method utilizes plants to absorb and detoxify pollutants from wastewater. Specially selected plant species with high tolerance to toxic substances play a pivotal role in this sustainable remediation process.

4️⃣ **Bioaugmentation:** By introducing specialized microorganisms into the treatment system, bioaugmentation enhances the breakdown of toxic compounds. These added reinforcements contribute to a more efficient and targeted pollutant removal process.

5️⃣ **Monitoring and Adaptive Management:** Continuous monitoring is essential in addressing high toxicity challenges. Implementing adaptive management allows for real-time adjustments based on data, ensuring treatment processes remain optimised and sustainable in the long term.

By embracing these powerful biological solutions and adopting proactive monitoring practices, industries can effectively combat the harmful effects of toxic pollutants in wastewater, paving the way for a cleaner and more sustainable future.",19 Mar 2024 02:24:23

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical\_uses\_of\_silver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_uses_of_silver)

> Silver and most silver compounds have an [oligodynamic effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligodynamic_effect) and are toxic for bacteria, algae, and fungi [*in vitro*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_vitro).  

Being ""born with a silver spoon in your mouth"" was such a good thing because the silver in the spoon could cut down on a little bit of illness in infancy, is my understanding of the phrase.

There's a ton of silverplate stuff out there on the secondhand market these days. It's not valuable the way solid silver stuff is. I got a smooth silver plated tray for like $8 secondhand. Smooth means that it's easy to keep clean (the ornate ones are beautiful, of course, but debris could get wedged in the designs so it's not appropriate for this application imo.)

It's a nice size, so I've been using it to stage my tox treatments. I set all the materials on top and it looks really funny: this vintage silver tray and all these needles lined up, plus gloves and alcohol in a mister bottle. I spray everything down with rubbing alcohol in a mister, use gloves and wipe them down with alcohol, and wipe my face with alcohol, as well, but I figure that having one more layer of protection is a nice idea. Those articles I read about some medspa being shut down for horrific infections scare me. I do as much as I can to keep a clean working space.

I'm not using the silver tray as a substitute for keeping a clean room. In fact, I cleaned the whole room right before I did my latest treatment. (The cat was in there jumping on surfaces before; you can't be too careful when preventing contamination from animals imo.)

Still, I think maybe this is a good idea that others might benefit from? I frequently see pieces of silver plate for sale secondhand at prices lower than a fast food order for one. It has antibacterial properties, is portable, and easy to clean. A lot of other posters here express worry about cleanliness and infection. Maybe this could be one additional layer of protection?",18 Mar 2024 14:45:11
34,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/1bhk97d/how_to_demolish_floridas_aquatic_ecosystems_in_3/,How to demolish Florida’s aquatic ecosystems in 3 simple steps.,"1: Spray chemicals in Lake O that kill aquatic plants, claiming it only affects the invasive plant species, but kills all forms of vegetation. Leading to a surge of algae and zero plants to filter the water, so it becomes an acidic and toxic mess. Leading to fish kills and unsafe, uninhabitable water.

2: Build man made lakes to filter water, using the same plants you killed in the first place, but at a smaller scale that doesn’t reverse the damage already caused. 

3: Release all of your Lake O toxic water into the ocean, turning it green, and like we see all over the place, kill endangered sawfish, mass fish kills, and the same headline every year “residents concerned over Lake O water releases”. 
It’s a money wheel. Pay people to spray (2.5 million), buy land and hire people to build ponds to hold filter (Hydrilla and other plants), put 2 million TAXPAYER dollars (REAL!) into researching why the fish are dying. 

People fail to see the problem at the source they wait to long until it is effecting their precious ocean. If they stop spraying the Lake, let vegetation grow, let it naturally filter the Lake, no more problems. Hydrilla is, in my experience, the #1 aquatic filter you can have, utilize it, it’s almost to late.
The problem is not sugar cane burning, not boaters complaining about vegetation getting in their prop, it is solely the spraying of Lake O.

Alternative forms like mechanical harvesting are a drastically better way to deal with weeds, instead of killing the plants they can be dried and turned into compost, feed, something that is productive.

I couldn't help but anxiously tap my claws together as I stared at the screen before me. Over the course of the last twenty days, Deklin had assembled a communication array as it was detailed in the data drive the humans had passed along. It was in the far edge of our territory, angled to reach one of their distant relays on the other side of the hostile stretch of space between us. It's trajectory avoided areas we knew the Arxur were residing in, but the design relied mostly on minimal bandwidth to minimize the chances of it being picked up anyway.

Speech to text was the smallest data packets we could send, and it also made it possible for us to communicate, since the friendly humans didn't have translator technology built yet. We passed along the proper data so they could decipher our scripts, and within the day the prime minister was having uncomfortable but otherwise productive conversations with them. Why our translators were already familiar with their language was a question that had been bothering me, and after doing some digging Laripo had found out exactly why that was the case.

The humans were not a new species, after all. They were a violent species, once compared to the Arxur. And somehow none of what we read or passed on to the representatives matched our treatment when we stumbled onto their doorstep asking for help. The most perplexing thing that we found was at some point the Federation thought the humans blew themselves up. There was some ancient news headlines that had noted rising tensions between world powers at the time, so I could imagine that the extermination fleet that was being assembled took a deep breath and sighed when they recorded several nuclear detonations. It seemed like Earth had reached the conclusion of its conflict, like its very own articles had been predicting.

I was glad whoever was in charge of those sensors never did a follow up.

As it stood, somehow the Combine had convinced Deklin to go through with an exchange that I never could have predicted. He had set up a data drop containing defensive platform technology, detailed historical records of the war, the plights the Cradle, Leirn, and Fahl, and maps of the known galaxy. There was likely a lot more information in the data drop that I was not aware of, but it wasn't my business to know what was in the data drop. Whatever it contained had been vetted and approved by Viggo and Glycid, the Yotul and Harchen representatives, respectively.

Their presence in the room wasn't what was filling me with the intrusive thought to run away.

What had me on edge was Deklin wanted them to come pick it up.

In the last week, the prime minister had found a decently sized docking station meant for off planet storage and distribution. Where he got it from, I had no idea. He'd also sat it at the edge of our territory, where it would be safe to excise if we were invaded in an act of betrayal. It was out of sight and out of mind for the entire Union, but if a firefight broke out it would be dealt with quickly.

Alas, it was not likely to come to that or none of the other representatives would be here. Casting a brief glance at Deklin, I wasn't certain if he would be here either, or if he'd daringly face the risk anyways head on.

The prime minister was hesitant to give them warp drives or anything they could use to mass produce FTL technology so soon in our talks, but he'd been talked into lending some older Gojid freighters. My team had piloted three of the average sized ships back across hostile territory for them, and we'd returned in a small cruiser we had strapped down in one of the ships. Not empty handed, thankfully.

The Combine had insisted that it would be best that they traverse the dangerous territory so none of our people would be at risk. They were banking heavily on the Arxur being gentle to them if they were caught, since they were fellow predators. I doubted it would matter what they were if the Arxur saw a Gojid ship in their territory, but there was some honor in taking the risk off of our shoulders and making it so Deklin didn't have to risk any more lives than necessary.

The truth was, this was how we would know if they were trustworthy enough to work with. They didn't have time to rip the warp drive out of any of those ships and put them back in before the first drop, and we'd lent them out in the first place with a firm request to not tamper with anything. If all three ships returned, then we would know that they were good with their word.

I wasn't certain if I should pray that this went well. I wasn't certain if I *could* pray for the humans. It was strange. Looking at Deklin again, I couldn't even begin to understand how he looked so reserved and not even slightly conflicted. What kind of punishment would the Great Protector have for us for doing this? Would she approve? Was a friendly predator even such a thing that could be accepted by her? We were doing this for the greater good of the herd, she had to understand that much.

There were whispers that she was growing ill. The priests didn't want to talk about it, but the lands were starting to weaken. Pests were growing more and more abundant, and there was uncertainty if scorching the lands to remove the greatest concentrations of them only made her worse. It hurt every time it happened, and her tears could only do so much to wash away the scars. Many pointed to the build up of algae blooms and contaminated reservoirs as proof that there was sickness in her tears and that we were hurting her, but nobody knew what to do.

It was a tragedy, and worse yet the practice failed consistently. It was only a short term solution, and it would ruin the land for the growing season while the surviving pests would just migrate to the next field, then the next. Their numbers would replenish, and then another burn would need to happen. The vermin were the worst offenders, and there was harsh disagreements on whether or not using poison would solve the problem or hurt the Protector even more. The idea ended up being scrapped, and Exterminators had to take on additional responsibilities culling the swarms with traps and dedicated teams. It didn't feel like they were making a difference at all, and only in the past few decades did a more sinister threat arise that forced us down the trail we walked currently.

Aided by migrating vermin, a fungus infection had rapidly spread across the globe and directly impacted major staple grains. Originally held at bay with sprays and treatments, a formidable group of the diseases surpassed the treatments and was spread by commerce and spores that clung to the fur and carapace of the vermin that migrated to fresher farms. It bloomed everywhere, and even made it to two other colony planets before we caught on and frantically locked down shipping before it could spread. Regulations were strengthened with an iron grasp, but at that point it was too late.

Attempts to find a stronger treatment for the blight didn't bare fruit until crop yields had diminished by a third, and the people were scared and desperate by then. The treatments worked on only a few strains of the fungus, which brought us back from collapse but didn't solve our crisis. The unaffected strains were still a threat, and many small farms could only stop the disease from spreading by burning their yields to protect the plots that were still uncontaminated. Countless greenhouses that had better protection still were not safe from vermin bringing things in, and a few had to be torched and rebuilt when fumigations failed to keep the fungus from taking root.

Subsidized hydroponics farms were the most secure agriculture assets we had, and were what got us through the worst of the blight. The Fissians had weaseled their way into contracts with them and were frequently playing on our strife to sell us parts and equipment for them, and under the extreme pressure from the famine the Gojid union had slowly been caving and sourcing equipment from the commercial titan.

That pressure got worse when news broke that somehow, several farms were compromised and their harvests ruined. Their prices rose to offer consultation and resources for additional sites, but they were hefty and we still had options.

We were lucky that our blight couldn't affect alien crops, but once more the cost to import was egregious. We were not the only people with famine. Fahl had locust swarms so thick that farming outdoors wasn't possible anymore, and the insects on their planet were highly toxic things that could kill you in moments, if you accidentally ingested contaminated food. Their insecticides only worked for a few years at a time, forcing their exterminators to spend weeks at a time culling the swarms themselves.

Gilead had claimed to have heard whispers that there was legislation being quietly considered to use warheads to cleanse entire swaths of heavily infested land in an attempt to flatten the curve of their exponential growth. Everything living was being eaten, and the sands were getting worse as the environment was steadily picked clean of everything that could keep their soil stable.

There were other planets struggling with similar plights. Yields crippled by diseases, resilient insects, prey overtaking the lands. There were plenty of planets that were still healthy and offering aid, but fear was abundant. Nobody wanted their planet to be next to be struck down by disaster, and that affected how tightly some species would hold onto their resources, just in case. Nobody wanted to end up like the Paltans, after all.

There were some species that all but vanished as time went on. If it wasn't for the Letians showing up at the Galactic Assembly each year, I wouldn't even know that they existed. They were heavy isolationists, and were of no help to anyone. The Leshee were similar, but unlike the Letians people wanted to bother them for resources. When a small coalition of representatives tried to force the Leshee representative to cave to their requests a few years back, the amphibian had icily warned them that they were more than capable of pushing back armed invaders, Arxur or otherwise.

I don't think anyone even knew if those two were doing okay or not. They didn't reach out to anyone as far as I was aware, and nobody wanted to reach out to them either.

I felt something on my foot and looked down, suddenly aware that Gilead limped up beside me and had loosely draped her tail across it to get my attention. I didn't know her before our fated trip, but I'd grown to consider her a friend in that short time. I was glad to see she was looking far healthier, and no longer had that medical band on her arm. It was just a normal wrapping now, lightly tied over scales that visibly shined better and better with each day.

""Are you okay?"" She quietly chirped.

""I am. I don't know how this is going to go, or if the Great Protector is going to punish us for trying this or forsake us if it succeeds."" I whispered, anxiously tapping at the console. ""It's insane, but this could change everything if it goes right. That's worth the risk.""

Gilead touched my side in understanding, but I ignored it. She didn't seem to comprehend the fact that is was predators that saved her life. I had a feeling that she didn't believe us; I couldn't fault her for that. Predators were the source of so much pain in the galaxy, and she'd been unconscious during our stay while we were questioned and taken care of. By all accounts she should never have woke up again. None of us should be standing here.

I rested my claws on the console, forcing them to be still.

And yet, we were. How did the Protector do that? Did she see how these humans composed themselves and bent over backward to try and make us feel more at ease? Deception would have ended when we went before the Combine's council, so they had been genuine. Did she see their honesty? Where they anything she had seen before, where a predator could be honest and caring?

The representatives were talking in hushed whispers with Prime Minister Deklin. Laripo was off on her own, intently watching the large monitor over my head that displayed the wide, barren floor of the storage room. At the far end was the one docking port that we didn't disable. We could have had all three ships board at once, but the image of being mobbed was one nobody could comfortably ignore. One at a time was the best option for both parties.

Dr. Kramer was here, but he was even more withdrawn than Laripo. He wanted nothing to do with this, but he couldn't stand letting everyone else be here without him. He had the worst experience with the humans, and refused to talk about whatever happened while that human cub had paraded him around. He looked outright miserable and sick, and it didn't slip past me that he was standing closest to a trash bin for a reason. I'd hide there too, if I was that small.

Glycid's scales were changing colors frequently, shifting through a mirage of distressed signals. ""Do we know how fast their industry is? What if they took the warp drives out of those ships and put them in their warships? They could cripple the Union with one heavy blow!""

Deklin didn't look humored. Neither did Viggo, who was the most reserved out of all of us. ""Three ships wouldn't be able do that.""

""Even your primitive constructs can destroy an Arxur ship, and we're all here without any defenses!"" The harchen's quip made me wince, and Laripo's ears dropped slightly. The yotul representative was much less forgiving, however, and hostility edged into his voice.

""*They* don't know that it's *us* on this station. Attacking this place would not guarantee any strategic victory, and lead to the destruction of the only technology they have to reach us.""

""But what if they took this time to figure out how the ftl drives work? They could be sending over an entire armada, and hit your people where they least expect it!""

Deklin put a paw over his snout in a rare show of irritation.

""Federation factories might be able to churn out several ftl drives a week, but the Combine neither has the infrastructure for that nor the refined resources on standby. They have three ships that can cross the distance, and even if they strapped their best weapons to them they wouldn't pose a threat beyond here. I implore that you take some time to think before you make claims like that, and especially if you think insulting your peers will get you any favors.""

Glycid's scales discolored in frustration and embarrassment, and Viggo subtly flicked an ear Deklin's way in appreciation. Everyone had the right be be anxious, but turning on each other with petty insults wasn't the time.

The yotul representative tapped his foot on the floor, getting their attention before he spoke. ""Now, before Glycid's *rational* outburst got away from himself, I wanted to discuss distribution of whatever's brought here today."" He started, still sounding reserved and collected despite the jab at the harchen representative.

""Given the strict oversight the Nevok and Fissans have on Leirn, I don't have a way to smuggle any assets to my people without being noticed. At least not yet. With that in mind, my people are fairing better than the both of yours. I'm going to lend my portion of the exchange to Fahl, as they need it the most.""

Glycid looked taken back, wide eyed at the offer. His gaze fell to the floor after a moment, and he spoke softly: ""Thank you.""

Deklin offered Viggo a respectful ear flick, before clearing his throat. ""I made a request for some refined minerals as well. If they can pass the purity tests, they can be used for medication. We won't need to bother the Zurulians, or have to be forced to deal with the Fissans for a few weeks.""

""How much did you ask for?"" Viggo inquired, giving the prime minister a strange look. Deklin remained impassive, but after a moment he sighed.

""Probably more than I should have."" He admitted. ""But if the Combine can supply it, it'll give us some information on their industrial status. We could open up trade, in the future.""

I looked down at the console, noting the time. I started tapping my claws again as I looked up at the monitor. There would be three blips soon. Three ships arriving at the edge of our territory when the humans would arrive.

And then, there they were.",17 Mar 2024 06:19:47

Vitamin D3 is the more natural form because it's the form made by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight. It is found in small amounts in some foods, but the vitamin D3 used in supplements mostly comes from lanolin (a fatty substance sourced from sheep's wool).

Vitamin D2 is sourced from plants, such as mushrooms. Although it is vegan, vitamin D2 isn't as effectively absorbed or used by the body as the D3 form.

But vegans don't have to settle for the less potent D2 form because there is also plant-sourced vitamin D3.

Vegan vitamin D3 is derived from lichen (an organic substance formed by algae and fungi).

Three of the best vegan vitamin D (D3) supplement brands are [Sports Research](https://www.breezybrain.com/get/vitamin-d-sports-research), [MRM Nutrition](https://www.breezybrain.com/get/vitamin-d-mrm-nutrition), and [Country Life](https://www.breezybrain.com/get/vitamin-d-country-life).

**Continued From Part 6**

Donner ducked out of the tent before Drelloc could ask him what he had meant and quickly made his way to the far side of the boulder they had used for that night’s shelter.  After a second to empty his bladder against a convenient scrub brush, Donner made his way over to the small handful of stones he had used to anchor the tarp down against the everpresent wind of Minasdee.

Untying them only took seconds as he had not used tight knots.  It hadn’t been that big of a concern to him that they stay secure for a long time.  They had only needed to last over the single night after all.  He kicked the stones back into the shadow of the rock as each was liberated from their coils.  Soon he was done and heading back towards the camp after having tossed the small topes back over the top of the toppled monolith.

He watched the alien from the corner of his vision as he worked on a quick and hearty breakfast of rehydrated MREs.  Drelloc was still struggling a bit with the ropes, but she had folded the tarp much quicker and neater than he could have managed.  Those incredibly dexterous hands of hers made short work of it and not for the first time he found himself wondering what it would be like to have two extra arms.  Hell why stop there, the vinarfel had ten arms, and fifty-some-odd legs as well to boot.

He chuckled at the thought.  What a terrible monstrosity he would be if he had anywhere near that many.  He checked the temperature of the water for the second packet and then finished up, pouring the scalding water into the small pouch and sealing it off with a vigorous shake.  The electric heater was coming incredibly handy, he was once more grateful that she had managed to get the survival duffel before the Valor had exploded.  He was not sure why Lady Luck had led him down this particular path, but he was in a way grateful for the experience.

As soon as he thought it he cursed himself though.  He had lost all his squadmates to this ranxshit mission, and the only people that he had to blame was the woman struggling with the last of the ropes in front of him.  But as he watched her he found he could not remain mad.

From what she had alluded to, this entire escort mission was not her idea and that made it a bit easier to forgive her for the disaster it had become.  All in all he found himself torn between his newfound feelings for her and his guilt for being the only survivor of the terrible calamity that had decimated his fellow soldiers.

He picked up the two packets after he finished clearing away the rest of the kitchen supplies before walking over and handing her one, they would need to get moving soon if they wanted to avoid the hottest part of the day later.  They finished their meal in contented silence, only the sound of their vigorous chewing punctuating the steady breeze that whipped through their camp.

Donner stood and looked around before reaching out for Drelloc’s trash.  She looked at him curiously till she understood and he packed it up in a side pocket of the duffel.  The world was suffering enough from the war without their litter cluttering things up on top of it.

“I feel much better than I did yesterday morning.”  She said, causing him to turn his head to look at her curiously.  “I am still very sore, and in many places I didn’t even know I could get sore.  But I don't feel so.. untuned?  Is that the right way to say it?”  She seemed at a loss for words.

Donner hefted the duffel and his rifle before answering.  He let out a heavy sigh as the weight settled firmly upon his shoulders.  “Well I suppose if you are anything like me, you are building new muscles.  This usually takes a while to really start having an effect, but you should notice some pretty immediate results when doing any kind of prolonged strenuous activity.”  He watched as she made a gesture he was unfamiliar with.  He supposed from the context that it could have meant anything from disbelief to puzzlement.  But it flashed by before he had the chance to ask properly.  He just suited himself by nodding at her.

He shifted and then glanced out into the near distance.  He checked his wrist worn assistant and then nodded in the direction they needed to tread.  “We need to make another five kilometers before midday.  If we keep focused I think we should be able to make it with little issue.”

Drelloc hopped from foot to foot as she responded sullenly, “And here I was hoping that we would need to swim today.”

He understood her sullen attitude, but he also knew that dwelling on the negative would drain both of their morale.  He needed to make sure he kept her focused on their goals, not just the next step in their admittedly half-assed plan.

He started to walk, pausing for only a moment to let her catch up to him.  Once more he was struck by her strange and frankly rather alien gait.  The way all four legs seemed to move independently of each other and yet she remained both sure footed and steady.  He glanced away before the slightly confusing display made him lose his own footing.

He swallowed a swig of water from his waterpack, the water was still a little cool from last night’s chill air and the cool liquid helped to ease the soreness in his throat.  He had expected their ordeal last night to bring them closer, but if anything she was feeling a little more aloof than the night before.  An undeniable tension had arisen between them, it had started the day before but had increased threefold overnight.

Donner glanced towards the alien woman again, trying to be as casual as possible.  One of her many eyes seemed to be fixed on him, the bright red eye flicking away as he saw it.  Had he just imagined it?  He was driving himself crazy thinking about it.

Surely she must feel something for him, she had acted in a manner that suggested it.  But then again she hadn't said anything concrete, and neither had he.  Maybe she was simply waiting for him to make the first move.  Was her species more or less assertive as females, he just didn’t know.

He almost fell flat on his face as his preoccupied mind missed an ancient dried root on the ground.  As his foot hit it he yelled out and stumbled forwards, he managed to catch himself on a nearby boulder.

Drelloc rushed to his side and reached out but stopped before touching him, her arms pulling back as he stood up wincing.  “Are you alright, Donner!  I.. good.”  She cut herself off.

He rubbed his shoulder painfully, at least one muscle in it had been wrenched painfully as he had stopped his fall.  He nodded to Drelloc, “Yes, thank you.  We need to be careful up ahead, let's take a short break.”

She nodded silently and scuttled a half a meter away before settling down to the rapidly heating earth.  She rubbed her arms and seemed content to simply observe her surroundings.  Donner gave a small sigh, here it was again.  That strange tension, almost as if a frozen cord was wrapped around them.  They couldn't get too close together, neither could they move far apart without being pulled together again.

It was near maddening so he did the only thing he could think of.  He pulled out the small piece of wood again and started to whittle at it carefully.  He had always gone back to his age old hobby when his nerves started to betray him, the slow methodical maneuvers of the blade as it coaxed the form hidden amongst the grain served to calm his mind like nothing else.  He supposed it had something to do with past trauma and suppressed childhood memories.  Or so the shrinks said.

He heard a scuffling noise but didn't look up from his work, choosing rather to remain fully absorbed in the process.  His deft strokes carved out several deep channels in the rectangular blank and then linked the channels together in several key places.  The form he sought beginning to take shape.

Before he did any more work on it he closed his knife with a snap causing Drelloc, who had in the intervening time scooted much closer, to jump to a standing position with a small yelp of surprise.

He pocketed the small piece of wood and rubbed his hands together.  He gave her a look and then spoke, “Alright, good enough.  Okay, the plan is to cut through the leftmost side of the beachhead zone.  It's a dangerous area so you need to keep your wits about you.”

Before he could say more she rattled off, “Diamonomolecular razor wire, duracrete pitfalls, unexploded munitions, biological contaminants, toxic mires, artillery craters filled with razor sharp shrapnel, mine fields, underground tunnels and the still burning wrecks of downed assault dropships.. to name a few.”  She smiled, her eyes crinkling in that manner he was beginning to recognise.

He nodded.  “Yeah, stuff like that.  How did you..”

Drelloc looked at him and waved a few arms in that same old way.  “I may not be a field agent, but data collection and battlefield intelligence is my specialty.  And I have quite a bit of accumulated data on no man's land.”

Donner nodded.  “Okay.  Good.  Well, stick close then.  You can read all you want about punji-pits and shell craters, but it won't give you the hands-on experience you need to avoid them properly.  He smiled slightly as she nodded with her hands, her eyes maintaining that sheer focus that he sometimes found alluring and other times so unsettling.

Turning back towards the land in front of them he could just make out the first few dark wisps of smoke on the horizon.  A bad sign that they were headed in the right direction.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Drelloc was fuming inside.  What was she doing, why couldn't she just tell the man what she felt?

But what did she feel?  She didn't even know what to tell herself, much less the focus of her fascination.  She knew that what she was feeling was some form of physical and emotional attraction, he made her feel safe.  Safe in a way that she had never felt before.  He had also helped her to finally come to terms with her other selves and reached balance in life that she had been lacking for as long as she could remember.

For that alone the man deserved her gratitude, and a medal.  But for saving her life multiple times on top of that.. She shook an arm that he couldn't see. The need to express herself was powerful enough that she couldn't fully contain it.

She had also not failed to notice that he had been eating all of the rations she had expressed her dislike of.  They had stopped for lunch and she had once more been given a chicken dish, this one had been called spicy chicken alfredo with brawklun.  She had quite enjoyed it, especially the strange reddish chunks of vegetable.

When she looked back over at the human he was once more carving that small piece of wood.  She didn't fully understand its purpose, she had gathered that it was a form of catharsis for him, but as to its deeper meaning she was as of yet unenlightened.  He had mentioned something about his father making carvings for his siblings as a child, but she didn't quite understand the appeal.

Maybe it wasn't about logic she realised.  Maybe it was simply a means of pushing the world away for a few precious minutes.  She herself liked to read as a manner of destressing from the world.  Great works by famous writers such as Ineen Aldrop and Jaclin Forrester came to mind.

Drelloc stepped over another large rock and observed her surroundings.  She felt one of her eyes focus on Donner and did her best to draw it away, but part of her just kept on moving it back towards him.  She brushed herself off with two arms as she tried to regain a little of her internal composure.  She needed to pay attention to their surroundings as he had warned, they were coming up on dangerous territory.

Indeed the curls of drifting smoke drew nearer with every step and she was beginning to detect something foul upon the wind.  Donner had given her a level four multispecies respirator almost half an hour ago, the contraption strapping over her mouth and helping to filter the air.  Her gills were still exposed on the underside of her head, but she did her best to keep them closed.  Both as protection from the growing heat of the day as well as to protect them from potential irritants.

Minasdee didn't rain much, the entire world being covered in arid scrubland and low grasslands near the poles.  As such the toxins of war were never washed away, instead they simply got concentrated by the heat and wind till there were places on the planet as dangerous as any radiological disaster site.

She knew that Donner was keeping an eye out for such pitfalls.  She watched as the human swept around in front of them with a small multitector tool, likely looking out for just such kinds of hotspots and poor air pockets.  The last thing they needed was to stumble into some noxious cloud of synthetic plastic degrading bacteria or something similarly nasty.

Biological weapons without limited lifespans or kill switches were prohibited for use in conflict by both sides as per the codes of war.  But this war had seen the rules stretched to the breaking point on both sides.  She herself had been disgusted to learn of the events that had happened in the Karax system.  Union sources vehemently denied involvement in the tragedy that had seen the destruction of an entire world without a trace.  But the Rebels had evidence to strongly suggest that they had nothing to do with it.

She only knew that the Union Science Division was running top secret experiments out of there, but that was the extent of her knowledge.  For all she knew the Union had been responsible for the deaths of those millions.  And if that were true then part of her would not even have been surprised.

She grimaced, her mouth twitching under the respirator she wore.  Those at the top would do anything to maintain their status.  She had found evidence of other things, things she dared not even think of lest they detect her in a lie during one of the UIA’s monthly loyalty inspections.

She was about to ask for them to take a short breather when Donner stopped suddenly, she didn't quite get the memo and took another step before she was grabbed and halted by the man forcefully.

She gulped in indignation as he hauled her backwards another step.  “Hey, what's the big idea..”  He shushed her loudly and pointed ahead.

She looked and then froze.  The ground in front of them was glass smooth and perfectly uniform in color.  Out of the corner of her eye she had not even noticed the difference, but now that he had pointed it out it seemed startlingly out of place.

Donner leaned down and picked up a small stone from the ground.  He gave her a pointed look and then tossed it.  It sailed through the air before landing square in the muck with a loud ‘Ploop!’  before sinking completely out of sight, barely a blemish on the surface of the quagmire to even show that it had gone in.

Drelloc shuddered and stepped back a pace.  She hadn’t even seen the danger.  Once more she owed the tall human her life.  She gestured to the deadly morass before them, “we need to find another way around.  What about that?”  She gestured towards what looked to be a collapsed trenchworks nearby.  The wooden gangplanks that allowed for passage over the flooded mire were still in place.

Donner gave her a nod.  “Okay, but I am going first.  If anything happens to me I want you to trek south.  There should be another way around that will add a day or two to the journey.”  He paused and then unslung the duffel from his back.  “Here, take this Drelloc.  You need to make it back to base.”

She grabbed it with three arms and then slung it over her shoulders as Donner walked out onto the gangplank.  It seemed to wobble slightly but held firm as he stepped across the wide quagmire filled trench.  She slowly and gingerly followed suit, her body rebelling against her by trembling in mild fear.  The thought of that dark mass consuming her, of her mouth and eyes filling with cloying toxic mud, it shook her in a way that she was scarcely willing to admit to even herself.

She crossed the patch without incident and lept into Donner’s outstretched arm.  Her body pressing into his for a brief moment as he steadied her.  Was it simply her imagination or did he linger close to her for longer than was necessary.  Almost too quick to notice he stepped away.

“We need to move faster.  I don't want to be caught in this hellhole when night falls.  Sleeping in a mask is uncomfortable at the best of times, and these are far from ideal circumstances.”

She gestured in an understanding manner.  She couldn't exactly smell the area around her in the same manner that he could, but her receptors were picking up many decidedly unpleasant notes drifting through the fetid air of the debris riddled battlefield.  She followed him slowly, making sure to match his every step.  They would be through this nightmare soon enough, she screwed several eyes shut, for once not wanting to be able to observe the entirety of her surroundings.  Instead she decided to focus on Donner’s back, the man leading her inexorably through the choking bog.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The going was slow and tedious, Donner making sure to use the multitector and his assistant to their fullest effect.  Steering their path as far from the worst of the irradiated zones where the charred remains of armoured vehicles lay.  The ground was soft, clay and sand left over from the construction of the subterranean fortifications that had made up the first lines of defense.

He shook his head and tried to ignore the scaling sun that beat relentlessly upon his back.  He spared a glance at his companion, the razah’voolian woman teetering along behind him.  Her strange alien form no longer quite so unfamiliar in his mind, he couldn't help but give her a reassuring smile and was pleased to see the skin around her secondary eyes crease in return.  Her own version of the gesture.

He suppressed a cough and shook his head.  The damn gas mask was supposed to be fog-proof, but he found that the eye pieces kept misting with his labored breathing.  He swore quietly under his breath and then stopped dead, his body tensing.

Directly in front of them was a deep impact crater, the trench having smashed asunder by the impact of some manner of dropship.  What had gotten his attention however  were the multitude of screaming corpses that littered the ground around the site.  Their bodies were charred, rotting flesh sloughing from shattered bone in the algae filled slime at the bottom of the hole.

He felt his gorge rise and had to double over, he had seen death before.  Many times in fact, he was a soldier.  But to imagine the manner in which these doomed soul’s had died, screaming in agony as the burning fuel of their wrecked ship drowned them in toxic vapors.  He shuddered, his eyes screwing shut at the horror of it.

He felt a trio of arms on his back after a moment, not condescending or pushing.  But gentle, comforting.  He heard a soft whisper, Drelloc speaking in reverence at her witness of the sight.  “There is no compensation for their deaths.  But we can at least make sure they are avenged, when this war is over they will be buried with honor Donner.  It is the least they are owed for their sacrifice.”

He knew the words were meant to sooth him, but he felt a white hot anger in his heart as she spoke them.  He stood slowly, a fist raised hateful to the sky as he raged, “What’s the point of it all!  We die like znots in a box for the honor of gutless cowards and corrupt politicians!”  Once more he was comforted by a pair of arms on his shoulders.  He stifled a sob that tried to tear its way from his breast and looked down at one of her hands.

She seemed to hesitate and then released him.  “I understand Donner.  I truly do, but things won't change while the war yet rages.  We need to keep moving, as you said.  Please.”

Donner stood, his hands shaking and his vision a bit grey.  He took a deep shuddering breath, the rage simmering just under the surface.  He shouldn't be mad at her, she had nothing to do with the war and his own current sorry situation on a backwater planet with no backup.  No, he needed to direct his anger towards the real assholes in charge.

He nodded his head and turned to look at Drelloc.  She took an uncertain looking step back as he let out the breath he had been holding explosively and gestured towards the left.  “We can move around the.. wreckage.  We should be able to make better time once we reach the secondary lines, they were less damaged in this area if memory serves.”

He turned from her before she could speak and started to pick his way across the edge of the hole, skirting the crater so as to not have to cross back into the mud that lay to either side.  This took them deeper into the hostile territory of the wrecked defense line.

Donner scanned the ground with his eyes as his other senses remained on high alert.  He might not have the same constant all around peripheral vision that Drelloc had, but from what he had read as a younger man humans had exceptional binocular vision for an omnivorous species.  The yeown had better vision in the dark and the slaaveth could see further under the water, but these specialties were outmatched in broad daylight on land.

He saw something that made his heart freeze and threw out an arm in the universal motion for halt.  In front of them was a series of small impact craters, several of which had small fins protruding from them.  They were unexploded bomblets from some manner of cluster munitions, incredibly dangerous as they may still be live.

He gestured to them and commented, “Unexploded bombs ahead.  We need to find another way, it's far too dangerous to risk weaving through.  A single vibration may be all that they require to detonate.  He and Drelloc turned and made their way across a nearby spit of land that jutted out into the crater strewn no man’s land between trenchworks.

The going was slow, every step fraught with peril, every breath labored by the knowledge of the terrible danger that lay all around.  Donner could feel the stress as it tensed his muscles and froze the blood to ice in his veins.  He stumbled and nearly fell, catching himself against a metal spar that jutted from the dry, cracked mud.  Looking back towards what had caught his foot he swallowed heavily, jutting from the ground was the barely recognisable form of a heavy machine gun.  The boxy shape rusted and looking completely ruined.

He checked his surroundings and then noted that Drelloc was stumbling slightly as well, he leaned against the metal bar and motioned for her to halt.

He nodded and then rested his hands on his knees.  “Let’s take a second to breathe.”

She made a tired looking gesture, part affirmative and slightly worried.  The way her blood red eyes seemed to take in everything made him acutely aware of the awful situation they were immersed in.  He felt the urge to reach out to her, to steady and comfort her, but he stopped himself.  He was her guardian, her protector.  He couldn't be more than that, not without getting too closely involved emotionally.

He shut his eyes and tried to block out the moaning of the wind as it blew steadily over the area.  It reminded him of the sounds that the old factory near to his childhood home made, the groaning of large things rubbing together.  He smiled slightly, the memories of his childhood managing to bring  a small measure of comfort to his ailing soul.  After another few minutes he had them move out once more, he honestly felt a little bit better now and it manifested as a little extra pep in his step.  His stride was a bit more assured, though he still kept vigilant of their surroundings.

He slowed as they neared another smouldering wreck, the burnt out hull of an armoured vehicle causing his multitector to spike.  The rapid clicking screeching danger signals at him as a gust of wind blew some of the thin white smoke their way.  Even months later the tank was still hot, likely due to some manner of low level fission reactions taking place in its ruptured promethium powercells.

He nodded to Drelloc and they made their way around the hulk.  Its thick metal plates twisted by the impact of something that had nearly turned it inside out.  Likely some manner of very large orbital or long range bombardment judging by the vitrified looking soil that spread from under its twisted form.

“This way, quickly.  That thing is pretty hot still.”  He gestured to Drelloc who followed along behind him, her pace definitely a little slower than it had been earlier.  She was getting tired, he needed to find a safe place to rest more substantially.

He looked around but saw nothing but more destitute cratered landscape, overflowing with pitfalls and discarded detritus of battle.  More than a few rotten bodies littered the space as well, neither side willing to brave the toxic swamps to bury their disgraced dead.

He kept moving along the side of this new embankment, trying to find a place where they could at least pause to hunker down without seemingly absorbing pollutants or stray radiation.  He scrambled up a crater in the earthen wall while motioning for Drelloc to stay put.

Donner reached the top without incident and ducked under a stray loop of razorwire to get his bearings again.  He noted with relief that they were nearly through.  The Beachhead was wide, extending for dozens of kilometers both to the north and south, but it was not terribly deep.  They had nearly pushed through, only a few hundred more meters of twisted and collapsed earthworks and they would be free of its ilk.  And good thing too, it was starting to get late in the day, the oppressive sun was dipping towards the horizon like some great glowing eye and he could feel the heat slowly leaching out of the planet’s atmosphere.  The lack of greenhouse gasses and cloud cover making the planet radiate off most of the day’s heat relatively fast.

Donner looked around quickly, trying to assess the best route to safety.  It looked like they could keep moving along the embankment for another few meters and then push through a breach close to the wreckage of another dropship.  From there it was a relatively straight shot to safety.

He scrambled down the wall and looked at her, “We are close.  Another few hundred meters Drelloc.  You can do this.”

She made an unknowable gesture and seemed to slump slightly.  Donner twitched, wanting to comfort her but not knowing how.  After a moment of indecision he decided to risk it and reached out, placing a firm hand on one of her shoulders.

Drelloc looked up at his touch, her smaller secondary eyes widening slightly, the crinkling of the skin around them forming a strange expression he couldn't decipher.  She made another gesture with two of her arms while a third reached up to cover his hand with one of her own.  Her skin was warm, the surface of it much softer than it looked given the grey wrinkled texture of it.  They stood like that for another moment, Donner feeling as though something unspoken had just passed between them.  An understanding of sorts.

He nodded and turned, not wanting her to see the rising color in his cheeks as they burned slightly.  She had given him that look again, the one she had given him the night before.  When she had brushed his hair.  He cleared his throat, he was a man.  He wasn’t about to admit to himself that just her touch had made his knees grow weak and his heart race like they never had before.

Donner picked up the pace slightly, not in anger, but in desperation.  He needed to get her out of here and to safety, the thought of anything happening to her.  It didn't bear thinking about.

They moved quickly over the embankment and down the other side, Donner making sure to scan the area for any threats or danger.  It wouldn't have been the first old battlefield he had been forced to scramble through, though this one was by far one of the most dangerous he had yet to encounter.  The pitfalls, the mud traps and toxic fumes all combined to make the whole place a definite deathtrap for the unwary.  Luckily the planet of Minasdee didn't seem to have much in the way of scavengers.

He perked up, he could see the end ahead, not more than seventy meters away there was a gap in the rusting razor wire and cratered trenches that led to firmer ground.  He glanced at Drelloc, the razah’vool woman was flagging.  Her strength all but spent but he saw her eyes smile as he looked at her.

“Are we.. nearly there?”  She panted through her respirator, the slightly muffled sound of her voice still making him smile.

He turned to look forwards again and skirted what looked like a ruptured powercell on the dry ground.  “Yes, not much longer.  We are going to rest just at the top of that hill, you see it ahead?”  He made a wide gesture forwards.

Drelloc started to speak, but her voice was cut off by a subtle noise followed by a sharp inhale from her.  He froze as the distinct sound rattled through the still air.

Click!

‘No, nonono..’  He thought silently as he slowly turned around.  His fears were realised as he looked back and saw her standing perfectly still, all four arms up and on her head in some gesture of terror or despair.  For under one of her suited feet was a buried and dirt covered disk.  The shape of the land mine was just barely apparent through the growing dusk.

Donner doubled over as if he had been punched in the gut, the feeling of horror that permeated his middle nearly crippling in its intensity.

He felt a single tear tear its way from the corner of his eye as Drelloc spoke, her wavering voice full of fatigue and fear.  “Donner, what do I do?”

53,https://v.redd.it/5zymyz4pxemc1,Advice for betta fish tank 🔥,"I love Bettas. My family has had them my whole life. Now, I’m at university, busy with the stresses of adult life, and (a little lonely) living in an apartment on my own. So, I got myself a crown tail a bit ago (about a year). 

My family were always good fish owners, so I know the basics (5+ gal, though my childhood fish always seemed happier in 3-5 gallons than anything above that, despite what I’ve read. Heater, filter, pellets and blood worm treats, and some hidey live plants) but not much more than that. Like I said, they were great no doubt, but probably not excellent. My current goal is to be an excellent fish mom. I love my little guy. 

He has a 5 gallon tank, a filter, a heater, 2 snails, a few anubis plants, and java ferns. In addition to this, he has a betta log, a small amount of red root floaters, and a pothos plant. I hadn’t read much about pothos for bettas, other than that they weren’t toxic, and so I added a few I had been propagating, more for decoration than anything. Come to find out, he LOVES his pothos. I think that’s what made me want to really improve everything even more for him. He loves swimming through the roots. It’s so fun to watch, and I swear he gets the zoomies before or after he eats, and will swim through all the windy roots super fast before he goes back to the surface to eat more. In terms of substrate, he just has some black gravel rock, nothing crazy. 

Ok, so now, here are my suggestion requests (though any and all suggestions would be appreciated): 

1) I hate the rock substrate. It is difficult to clean, it gets dirty after a while with whatever small amounts of food aren’t eaten in time before they float to the bottom, probably with fish poop too, and I feel like it’s not super conducive to plant growth, specifically for my Anubis (although my Java fern is FLOURISHING to say the least) But, I don’t know what else to use. I would love to plant grass for him, but I don’t know what to use or how to start. Where do I get the grass? Is it even called grass?  Are there different kinds? Do I use seeds? What substrate do I plant it in? Or would I need multiple layers of substrates? How would I clean it? Would I even need to clean it? Can I have aquarium grass in only a 5gallon tank? It’s something I’ve only really seen in large extravagant tanks. 
2) If I was able to successfully get some grass going, I would really like some tiny shrimp too (if possible in a 5 gallon tank, which I’m also uncertain of). A while ago, I got 2 ghost shrimp to take care of any algae, in favor of snails (which I have since swapped to). I think they were eaten (which I felt horrible about). So, ANY suggestions in this department would be appreciated as well. Also, if I was to get shrimp, where would I get them from? The only pet store near me is petsmart, which doesn’t have a huge variety.
3) I know little to nothing about the PH/chemical process going on in the water. I am an english/history/math girl, not much of a science girl, to put it lightly. I’ve tried reading forums on it, and just have a hard time understanding. My ph is good, sitting around 7 when I check, but past that I just have no idea what I should be doing or how to do it. I know enough about chemistry that I know there are probably various things happening in the tank that could chemically imbalance it. I get concerned about dead plant matter, or his poop, or if the snails poop? And things like that, because I don’t pay much attention to the actual water past a 25% water change once a month. Is that even enough? All I use when doing this is a water conditioner, letting it sit for a while before I put him back in. Any advice or explanation here would be greatly appreciated. 

Overall, I hope I do a pretty good job as is. I would like to get more into it though, and I think heavily planted bright tanks are beautiful and functional for the bettas quality of life, and I’d be lying if I said I didn’t want to spoil mine a bit. Anything would be appreciated! I’ve included a video of my betta that shows him, and a bit of his tank as well (partially because I’m proud, but partially so there can be a visual to connect to.) 
Thanks to anyone who has taken the time to read this and has any advice for me!!

I was in the most delicate situation of my career, between two invaders from others world, two invaders who had already won before we even knew what the empire they served truly was. For the good of my kind, I needed to find out fast.

The people of the United Republics had made their choice, and I would respect it, but they were only a fraction of all Varuls. If the need were to arrise, I could rally other countries to my cause. This ""interplanetary"" empire was strong, but we were the defenders, and technology could only do so much. Varuls were precise with their swords and deadly with their spears, and our boats were made from the strongest wood of the deepest forests. No fancy tricks the invaders had up their sleeve could defeat that.

My mind was racing about an escape plan. If I leaved the city this evening, I could reach Ferruma in little more than a week. My voice would be listened there, if I then sent a messenger...

"" Well high consul, you're suddenly very silent. You didn't even touch your plate !""

It was the ambassador who spoke, and it brought me back to reality. The banquet. I needed to use this occasion to gather information before I left. I was also wary this ""human"" was finding my behavior suspicious. I drank a bit of kalia, a traditional alcoholic drink, before asking my question :

"" Earlier, you said that your empire was different from the ones built by Varuls. Why call it that way, then ?""

It was the Archemin sitting next to me who answered.

"" Well, as I said, it a long story. Let's just say than the word ""empire"" is a remnant from a time where it was similar to what you call an empire.

- And how long ago was actually this time, count ? You say it's a long story, but it's gonna be a long feast. I would like to know what exactly we joined.""

The ambassador intervened again :

"" Why not tell him, Count ? They'll find out eventually, and besides, it's to late for them to back out now. The deal was done and we have the power to enforce it.

- You are without a doubt the worst diplomat I have ever met, and if you were not somehow also the best, I would have fired you years ago. Fine , he said, turning to me. We'll tell you everything.

Three centuries ago, the Archemin had an empire like the ones you mean. Worse, even. The noble families of Archemins were slaughtering each other for the throne, for power, for money, for land, while other species were reduced to slaves for our fields, mines and factories.""

So they used factories, like those madvaruls from Weast were building ? Interesting. That could be an advantage for us, as the quality of goods produced by our people would probably be unrivaled in the empire.

""But things changed when we found them.""

He was pointing at the ambassador.

"" We discovered the humans during a period of stability, when the throne was firmly held by House Alleon. They were one of, if not the, most advanced civilization we had discovered so far. They were on the verge of starting their own interplanetary expansion, yet we still conquered them in a couple of months. At this point, we had a method to enslave species that had not failed once. Show up, attack by surprise, bring in settlers to become the ruling class of the newly conquered world, use extreme brutality to crush any opposition. We had to break their will, destroy their culture, erase their civilization as fast a we could. Usually, it took a few years to be accepted as rulers, and even in those years, unrest was minimal. After all,  most species we enslaved by their own rulers before, so it didn't change much for them, and the medical and technological advances we provided helped to ease the pain. Besides, it's not like they had the weapons to fight us even if they wanted.

Humans were different, however. They had a lot more to lose and a lot less to gain from becoming our slaves, and if you add in their actually decent weapons, it was a recipe for brutal guerilla warfare. The humans resisted us in every possible way, hiding books and other cultural artifacts from our destruction for exemple. It did not help that their storage technology at the time allowed them to store a library's worth of knowledge in their pocket, and replicate it in a few minutes.""

I did my best to contain my surprise. It seemed I had underestimated the invader's technology.

"" They used this to keep teaching their traditions to their children, but also their science, and that was the real danger. Our science was what gave us the advantage on the other races, much more than our physical strength. With their science, humans could build bombs, firearms, repurpose stolen spacecrafts, synthesize a large array of poison, even genetically improve diseases. It was far from ours, but enough to cause trouble.

- And cause trouble we did, laughed the ambassador. Sabotages were so frequent that factories spent more time being rebuilt than working, and the productivity of mines was so low that the director of the Earth coal mining consortium couldn't heat up his own office with the production. Terran diseases were adapting suspiciously quickly to our beloved overlord's cash crops, and the only profitable Archemin ventures were the drug cartels that traded human produced drugs for weapons and tech.

- And that's only material damage. The cost in lives was even more terrifying. As soon as the humans discovered a new substance toxic for us but not for them, you could be sure to find it in your food the next day. If you survived the bombs in the place you slept at, you would still need to escape improvised snipers for the entire day, if you were lucky enough to not have to face an all out attack.

- And that was on Earth, were no man would be insane enough to use nuclear bombs ! But any other planet where you tried to use human laborers would surely get some free fireworks !

- Ah, yes,  timing was against us about that. See, the humans were at the height of the ""second cold war"" when we arrived, and their nuclear arsenal had grew to a total of around 200 000 warheads.

- Forgive my ignorance, but what is a ""nuclear bomb"" ?

- Well, said the ambassador, a small one could raze this city, while a big one could burn down a country and make it uninhabitable for a generation. I dont know the technical details however. Unfortunately, the Archemin were smart enough to only use us in a small, barely colonized region of space around Earth, so their Homeworld escaped from getting glassed""

I was getting less optimistic about our chance to beat the empire now.

"" But, what about the repression ? Didn't it dissuade them to do that ?

- Thing were getting so bad that repression couldn't even be applied properly anymore, said the count, while eating an algae-fruit. A public execution ? Humans weren't the ones that ended up shot down that day. A prison ? That's what demolition explosives are for ! In fact, we even tried to just use the barren continent at the south of Earth as a prison, because surely *that* was inescapable, right ? The governor of the Sun sector was not amused when we discovered the biggest clandestine spaceport in recorded history there three month later.

-Thankfully, his disappointment was short, as the life expectancy of that job was around six days at that time.

- Anyway, after nearly ten years of this bloody conflict, the emperor decreed it had to stop. Sure, the costs of the operation was barely making a dent in the imperial coffers and most soldiers sent to earth were death row prisoners anyway, but trouble was brewing, and he believed that he would soon need everything he had. This hemorrhage of ressources had to stop, and if violence didn't work, then he would use a truly unprecedented method...""

56,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/1b0wnpo/breaking_down_monster_descriptions_the_aboleth/,Breaking Down Monster Descriptions: The Aboleth,"Well hello there, describers of worlds! Its ya boy back at it again, as I attempt to break down how to describe all the DND 5e monsters in alphabetical order. For the third addition we’re looking at the ABOLETH.

# Official Canon Monster Description/Lore

Aboleth, as of 5e, are ancient, nightmare water beasties, arguably the first apex creatures to ever exist. They ruled the world at the dawn of time, enslaving all creatures around them until the gods came and sent them scurrying into the darkened corners of the world. Aboleth all have perfect ancestral memories, so they remember their fall from grace with perfect clarity and harbor massive resentment about it, constantly working patiently behind the scenes to bring the world back under their domain once more.

Physically, the aboleth actually has a pretty solid description going for it which is nice for us. 20ft long, 6500lbs on average (with ancient aboleth maybe hitting up to 40ft in length) and resembling a nightmarish eel fish. Past editions had the aboleth looking a lot more fish like, leaning into the ostracoderm (armored jawless fish from the paleozoic era) look and had three oblong eyes all stacked atop one another. 5e goes a lot more eldritch squid monster in its direction, multiple tentacles all branching from the back of the torso equivalent (called the trunk if we use squid anatomy), a lamprey style circle mouth with horrible rows of sharp looking teeth and a long tail with fin like membranes and three eyes stacked on top of each other. Easy peasy.

# When is your party going to encounter an Aboleth?

Since aboleth are the classic “lurker in the deep” type of creature it tracks that they would only be encountered in, you guessed it, THE DEEPS. This can mean deep ocean, deep in some massive lake or lurking somewhere in a murky body of water deep in the underdark, its all up to you! Personally,  I'm of the opinion that PCs shouldn’t encounter an aboleth without first encountering a series of odd environments, strange circumstances and excessive amounts of slime, but hey once that checklist has been gone through and the mood has been set? Then baby, its aboleth time.

&#x200B;

# What things would PCs notice BEFORE actually seeing the Aboleth?

Listen, I love setting a good scene and I love to foreshadow. I feel like that stuff really makes or breaks any sort of monster encounter, but that feels especially important for a potential BBEG aboleth style monster. So lets talk about some of the descriptive signals that would suggest an aboleth is up to shenanigans in the area.

**First and foremost, slimy surroundings.**The monster manual states that anywhere within 1 mile of an aboleth lair is slimy and wet. So, if we have an aboleth in control of a seaside town or fishing village then it makes sense the ocean be downright narsty. Any and all beaches should be choked with algae, mildew and mysterious slime and any cliff faces should be nearly insurmountable due to all the wonderful aboleth gunk.

*The ocean here has a sickly black, greenish hue to it and you can see massive clumps of algae form a slimy layer just below the surface.*

*The rock face of the seaside cliffs are immediately treacherous, coated thoroughly in a slippery layer of brown and black algae collecting in slimy clumps that resemble wet hair pulled from a drain.*

*The wood of the seaside docks are caked in filth, a thick layer of muddy slime covers the rotting boards making a slip and fall into the dark algae choked water seem likely…*

**Second! Gross Water**The water itself around an aboleth is described as supernaturally fouled and toxic to drink. For inspiration I spent some time looking into aquatic dead zones. Aquatic dead zones are areas in bodies of water that have such a low oxygen levels that most living creatures cannot survive while a small few proliferate to an alarming degree. What if the aboleth, by sheer proximity changed the chemistry of the water? Perhaps aboleth slime infuses the water over the course of months, making it harder for oxygen to penetrate through? This would lead to a huge die off of aquatic life, as both flora and fauna struggle to get the oxygen they need to exist. Many creatures and plants die, polluting the water with their rotting bodies and fueling massive algae blooms, creating exactly the sort of slimy, foul water that the Monster Manuel describe as the terrain of an aboleth.

*A cloying smell comes from the water, so strong to be an almost physical experience. It smells like rotting fish and stagnant mud.*

*You splash into the filthy lake and feel the water cover you like a viscous coat. The visibility here is severely limited, every step along the bottom causes a puff of muck to cloud the water. Through sparse clearings in the murk you see rotting remains of aquatic creatures slowly being taken over by algae and slime.*

**Third! Odd NPC behavior**

A location under the influence of an aboleth means a portion of the populace is enslaved by the aboleth. Since there is no upper limit on the amount of slaves the aboleth can actually make, its up to you to decide what percentage of the population is aboleth controlled. No doubt in early stages of occupation,the primary goal of the aboleth thralls would be to recruit and transport new folks to the aboleth for enslaving. Sounds like the perfect set up for a cult! A strange underground group of worshipers who meet in the dead of night to manipulate or kidnap, taking victims down dark, disgusting tunnels, dragging them away to get slime slaved by the aboleth itself? Hell yeah.

Its worth noting that the aboleth thralls are still largely in control of themselves, making their own decisions and maintaining their own personalities (sort of). Enslaved by an aboleth means that a) the aboleth can talk to you at any point from any distance and b) you are charmed by the aboleth which means you can’t go about harming it AND it has advantage to socially interact with you. This implies that the aboleth enslavement works in a subtle insidious way rather than simply mind breaking the target. Instead the aboleth will worm its way into your mind, offering you all you desire if you follow it, promising that if you do just one more task you’ll be free, convincing you that everything you are doing is the right call, and no doubt once you commit some atrocities, gaslighting you into thinking you are in too far now to ever back out.

Obviously having an inhuman creature with a superiority complex, gaslighting you from inside your own brain probably isn’t the greatest for mental health. So I’d expect anyone with a bad case of aboleth on the brain to be behaving erratically.Yet people are unique so a spectrum of individual response to the aboleth enslavement would make sense. Power hungry individuals and those with naturally lower empathy might throw themselves into the aboleth worship full force, reveling in their dark deeds and naturally moving up the ranks of the aboleth’s favorites. These would be the cult leaders, seemingly calm and in control, but catch them unaware and you’ll see them whispering frantically to themselves as if speaking to something that isn’t there.An individual on the opposite end of the spectrum would be plagued by constant doubt and exhibit self soothing behaviors, anything from twitches, tics and fidgets, to more self destructive behaviors like drinking obsessively or not sleeping.

*As you peek through the keyhole you watch the proud, arrogant councilman undergo a shocking transformation. Bent over nearly double in a strange sort of bow, she whispers to nothing that you can see. “My lord please, I only need a little more time. Soon, I swear! Yes my lord, as you say.”*

*The halfling twitches as you talk to him, his hands playing with a piece of string with a frantic manner. “I didn’t kill her, I swear I didn’t.” he mutters. As you watch he wraps the string around his finger so tightly the tip of it goes white as the circulation is cut off. He doesn’t seem to notice.*

# Main Features of the Monster

For humanoid monsters, the natural instinct is to look at the face. Since humans are wired for body language and a lot of important information is expressed via microexpressions and the like, we are hardwired to first pay attention to the face. What happens when you have a creature that is of such an alien shape that this goes out the window? I’d suggest you’d notice size first, then movement (in this case tentacles and tail) then mouth and lastly eyes. Of course all of this depends on the context in which you encounter the aboleth, so you should absolutely mix it up as you see fit!

&#x200B;

# Size, Body shape and Movement

First off, I love starting with SIZE. The average aboleth is 20ft long  which easily makes it 3-4 times bigger than your average adventurer. Describing a looming behemoth is always a fun way to ratchet up the tension.

While early additions of the aboleth had an almost triangle fish shape to them, the 5e design has a much sleeker, longer, almost eel like design to them. 5e aboleths are elongated and much more streamline, clearly designed for quick movements and sudden starts and stops. The aboleth will move through the water with ease by using its finned tail, lashing it back and forth (side to side) to propel it forward while using the tentacles to steer. In tight spaces, the tentacles would also help it to maneuver by pushing off available surfaces. On land however, the tentacles become the primary means of locomotion as the aboleth is limited to dragging its form along the ground.

*You catch a flash of movement out of the corner of your eye, something massive, eel like and sleek leaves a trail of slime behind it as a long finned tail propels it through the water.*

*An enormous elongated creature heaves itself up out of the algae slick hole amidst the chanting cultists, its form impacting onto dry land with a resounding boom you feel in your feet.*

# Tentacles

Next up, tentacles! If we’re going off of the 5e artwork, then an aboleth looks to have four tentacles, each roughly the same length, unlike squid or octopi no suction pads are to be seen. Since the aboleth lacks a grapple or restraining feature built into its tentacle attacks, it seems safe to say that the tentacles of an aboleth are more for locomotion, propelling it through the water or dragging it about on land rather than for grappling or restraining. Each one is one is thick and round, much more like a limb than the tentacles of an octopus or squid.

*The creature pushes off the rock face with four thick tentacle like limbs, the force of it cracking the dying coral and the rock underneath.*

*Two thick tentacles, each nearly two feet thick lash from the monsters side, dragging its leviathan form like a fish out of water from the pool, ever closer to the waiting cultists, a trail of slime in its wake.*

# Tail

The aboleth’s tail is much longer than its tentacles and would extend behind it, beyond the tentacles while it swims. Based on the orientation of the fins, the aboleth would move by lashing its tail side to side to propel itself forward. The tail almost seems to be another tentacle that over time evolved for swimming, so unlike a lot of fish tails it would retain its more tentacle nature, moving more like an eel or lamprey rather than a fish. About three quarters of the way down the tail we see a dorsal spike with a small fin, primarily used for balance, while the tail fin almost seems to resemble something more akin to a bats wing, thin skin stretched between spikes of the tail, rather than a traditional fish tail.

*The longest tentacle in the dead center of the creatures mass seems more akin to a tail, much thicker than the rest, it ends in series of spikes with a thin translucent skin stretched between them, similar to the wing of a bat.*

*Deep in the water of the pit, you catch sight of a lashing tail that whips back and forth slowly, keeping the creature balanced on the edge of the land and water, as the cultists walk their sacrifice closer.*

# Eyes

Aboleth traditionally have three eyes stacked vertically one on top of the other along the brow of the creature’s head. Most predators have forward oriented eyes because it provides better depth perception which is better for hunting and grabbing things. The fact that aboleth eyes are stacked on top of each other vertically rather than two eyes in a horizontal line would mean the aboleth would have a relatively narrow field of vision, but the addition of the third eye positioned towards the top of the head mean the aboleth is able to see above themselves with perfect clarity. This would imply an evolutionary lineage as bottom dwelling creatures that hunted creatures located above themselves. I’d suggest then that in a fight this would mean an aboleth prefers to be lower than its foes in the water, reaching up with its tentacles to smack em around.Another weird thing to consider is that fish don’t usually blink. Its more or less unnecessary since the constantly flowing water around them keep the eyes wet and free of debris. But aboleth are technically amphibious and if you’re going on land you’re going to need to keep your eyeballs wet. Mudskippers unlike the vast majority of fish blink (since they climb about outside the water), same with frogs and salamanders. It would make sense then that aboleth too would blink. Frogs in particular utilize something that I think makes the most sense for aboleth, a semi translucent eyelid called a nictitating membrane. This eyelid would serve to keep the aboleth’s eyes moist when on land and can even be closed while swimming to avoid all that nasty murk and sludge from drifting into the aboleth’s eye while swimming. All this is to say, hey maybe you can describe a creepy blinking to your players…

*Three dark eyes bulge out of the creatures face. Not vertically, but horizontally stacked, the eyes bisect the monsters face, each of them dark voids that shift slightly to take you in*

*As you gaze down into the depths at this behemoth eel creature, you watch as one eye, placed nearly on the top of the creatures head, stares directly back at you.The cultists shove the weeping woman to her knees in front of the beached aboleth. Its three dark eyes all turn to gaze down at her. The creature blinks as it takes her in, translucent lids swiping sideways across its eyes, leaving a wet sheen of slime across its pupils.*

&#x200B;

# Mouth

Aboleth design has clearly taken inspiration from the lamprey and nowhere is that more apparent than with its weird, toothy, circle mouth, but the lamprey use their weird mouth to latch onto bigger creatures and suck out the juices, a method of feeding that seems unlikely for the aboleth.

An aboleth is big enough that it makes the most sense for it to simply swallow prey whole, a theory that is further backed up by the fact that the aboleth lacks a bite attack, implying little jaw strength, if it even has the ability to munch down with that weird circle mouth at all. Instead, it makes sense for the aboleth to swallow its prey as whole as possible, while its toothy lined maw and gullet serve, rather than tearing or grinding, to dig into its prey and stop it from simply swimming out as the aboleth tries to choke it down.

Past aboleth lore mentions that they are also filter feeders, which doesn’t make a ton of sense with how toothy looking our 5e aboleth is. But hey, why not a bit of both?Baleen whales filter feed by using a structure that looks like a thousands of hairs, all made of keratin. What if an aboleth had something similar between its spiky teeth to filter anything tasty down its throat. Of course, why not flavor it by saying aboleth baleen is in fact extra sharp and serves to shred larger prey as it passes down the aboleth gullet. Pretty neat.The aboleth is big enough to swim about with its mouth open most of the time, filtering algae, microorganisms, small fish and such directly into its gullet and then pumping the excess water out the gills on the side of its head, sort of whale shark style. If the aboleth doesn’t have a slave legion bringing it sacrifices then I'd assume this would primarily be how it gets its sustenance. However as soon as a collection of thralls enter the mix, since the aboleth gains the memories and knowledge of anything that it eats, it makes sense that the aboleth would reserve its big meals for something that not only assuages its physical hunger, but its hunger for knowledge as well…

*This creature’s circular maw is filled with pointed, yellowed teeth that seem to layer its esophagus far past the length you can see down its throat.*

*As you narrowly escape being swallowed whole you catch a glimpse of layers of sharp serrated teeth, separated by strange bonelike structures layered with needle like protrusions. This creature seems to have some sort of baleen, albeit one that looks like it would shred flesh if touched.*

# Slime

Alright good news, I’ve thought way more about aboleth slime than anyone every should and I’m here to tell you all about it. Even more good news is there are plenty of slimy creatures in the ocean we can look at when we think about aboleth slime. In fact, slime is a pretty common adaptation used for a whole variety of things, though perhaps we should be calling it what it actually is… mucus. Way grosser sounding somehow.

Anywho, plenty of animals coat themselves in mucus for protection, clownfish, moray eels, pacific hagfish for example. Particularly this is seen in sea creatures who don’t have scales, which means the aboleth is perfectly suited to this group.

I think its fair to assume that at least some of the aboleth’s solid armor class is due to the protective layer of mucus coating it. This is both super gross and super exciting because as a DM it means that every time my PCs try and hit an aboleth I get to describe how their weapons sink into this viscous mucus and fail to penetrate its flesh. Hooray! Fun fact, the pacific hagfish has been known to produce enough mucus under duress to choke sharks, take that wildshaped druid!

The thick slimy layer would also be what protects the aboleth when it is out of the water, retaining the moisture it needs to avoid shriveling up into a crusty little tyrant wannabe.

The other fascinating strategy that ocean creatures use their slime for is the capture and consumption of microorganisms. Vampire squid literally wave around lil mucus fishing rods and then reel em in and and eat it slime and all.  Now, we already know that aboleth partly exist as filter feeders so this strategy would also absolutely be available to them. Want to thoroughly gross out your players and really hammer home how alien your aboleth is? Maybe every now and again it moves its tentacle arm into its horrifying circle mouth and scrapes off some of the slime and gunk for a little snack! Yuck.

And of course, maybe the most important thing that the aboleth's slime does? Infects creatures that come into contact with it and makes it so they can only breath water...

*A thick layer of mucus coats the tentacle that lashes out at you, leaving a trail of slime behind in the water.*

*A massive tendril wraps, surprisingly gently around the cutlist’s sacrifice and you watch as she is coated in the same viscous slime that covers the creature. Her struggles change to gasps, her hands flying to her throat as she seems unable to breath. You watch, horrified as the aboleth releases her and cultists rush forward, grabbing her and throwing her into one of the pools. You watch as she finally manages to take a breath into her lungs below the surface of the water…*

*The aboleth swings a tendril through the blood that clouds the water around your wound. You watch in horror as it brings the tentacle tip back to its mouth and scrapes off a layer of slime, coated with your blood, against its teeth. That same incomprehensibly deep voice booms in your mind. “****Delicious. I look forward to filling my maw with your entrails****”*

&#x200B;

# Making an Interesting Aboleth

Now unless your campaign is pretty buckwild, or set in earlier editions where there were entire cities of aboleth, its unlikely your party is going to encounter more than one of these, two at absolute maximum. That means we don’t necessarily have to give the aboleth as many variable attributes since its unlikely your PCs will have to tell two apart. That being said, there are certainly directions you could go with this such as…

**More tentacles!** More tentacles means more thangs for swanging at your angry PCs. If you want to tweak the aboleth a smidge, you could give the tentacles suction cups similar to squid or octopi and sneak a little grapple into the statblock. Don’t forget! Squid suction cups have teeth on em, so don’t forget about that slashing/piercing damage!

**More eyes**! Hey why not get rid of some of those obvious blindspots. The aboleth already has three eyes, why not more? I’ve seen some sweet art where the aboleth has tons of eyes all tucked into the nooks and folds of its face. Cool as heck.

**Injuries!** Maybe your aboleth has got some battle scars duuuude. Missing a tentacle tip, having a scarred over eye or seeing a massive indent of shark teeth along the aboleth’s side all have super interesting story telling potential!

&#x200B;

Well hey, thats all I have for you! If you’ve read this far then that's crazy and I appreciate you! Have you got any cool aboleth ideas? What crazy ways have you described them to your players? I'd love to hear them!Hope you have a great week and I wish you luck at all your tables!",26 Feb 2024 18:38:44

SS: This Article is clearly linked to the collapse of civilization, as it is an ecosystem, that clearly is in a state of collapse, as more and more occurrence will cascade into its oblivion. Last year, the Lake was covered in toxic algae blooms, which now have disappeared under the surface. First consequences might no be seen, in this loss of flies.

In the past few years, birds migrating to the the lough over winter, reduced from 100.000 down to about 21.000 birds. The eel fishing season reduced from 5 months down to about 2-3 weeks.

Residents are trying to get the ownership of said Lough Neagh, to trying to protect it, as the government isn't doing enough.

**‘Like the flip of a switch, it’s gone’: has the ecosystem of the UK’s largest lake collapsed?**

*Lough Neagh’s flies were seen as a nuisance. Now their sudden disappearance is a startling omen for a lake that supplies 40% of Northern Ireland’s water*

Declan Coney, a former eel fisher, knew there was something wrong when the famed swarms of Lough Neagh flies failed to materialise. In past years, they would appear around the Northern Irish lake in thick plumes and “wisps” – sometimes prompting mistaken alarm of a fire incident, Lough Shore residents say.

Clothes left out on a washing line “would be covered in them”, Coney says. So would any windshield on a vehicle travelling around the lough’s 90-mile shoreline. Conservationists marvelled at their courtship dances, hovering above treetops.

Last spring the flies never arrived. “This is the first year ever that, if you walked up to the Cross of Ardboe or the area around there, you’d find there’s no flies,” Coney says.

The flies were long considered a nuisance. Now, however, alarm is growing. “People have really been scared,” he says, by the rate of accelerated change to the lough’s ecology that their absence signals. “It’s just happened. Like the flip of a switch, it’s gone.”

“Lough Neagh fly” can refer to various non-biting midges, but these crucial insects support fish and wildfowl that are endemic to the lough system, as well as frogs and predatory insects. The loss of these keystone species, alongside sharp reductions of others, the spread of invasive species like zebra mussels, and a long-term deterioration in water quality, indicates deep trouble across the lough’s entire ecology. It also raises the prospect that this shallow body of water and its surrounding wetlands may have shifted beyond a state of decline into cascading ecosystem collapse.

Lough Neagh – the largest freshwater lake in the UK – supplies more than 40% of Northern Ireland’s drinking water, and hosts the largest wild eel fishery in Europe. It is considered a cultural and archaeological “jewel” that reaches “way back” into the very beginning of shared memory on the island.

Last summer, a vast “bloom” of blue-green algae – a thick, photosynthesising blanket that deprives the lake of oxygen, choking aquatic life – brought the lough’s accelerating biodiversity crisis into sharp focus. It prompted considerable public outcry and is expected to return in “more severe” form this coming summer.

The toxic algal growth – described by local people as appearing like something otherworldly due to its brilliant green or blue appearance – has since disappeared from the surface of the lough, but remains visibly suspended just underneath.

The problems have been exacerbated by the paralysis of Northern Ireland’s power-sharing institutions, which have been dormant for 40% of the period since they were formed by the Good Friday agreement, including almost all of the past two years. Members of the devolved assembly only began debating the management of the lough last week. As the politicians gathered, new reports emerged of a thick, pale scum appearing on the lough’s waterways.

From the mouth of the River Blackwater, Ciarán Breen rows out on to Lough Neagh. Breen has spent about three decades working on this body of water. His vessel is a cot, a small wooden boat he helped to build by the shores of Maghery, a village near Portadown on the lough’s southern end.

Breen pauses to take stock of the losses he has witnessed since he began work here as a wildlife ranger in 1986.

“In the winter, we did an annual wildfowl count – a colleague and I did this particular section,” he says, gesturing towards an area of several square kilometres between Coney Island and Kells Point.

“We got about 50,000-60,000 diving ducks. So many that people – our bosses, I mean – came out of Belfast to take a look for themselves, since they didn’t believe us at first.”

These fleets of pochard, scaup and goldeneye made Lough Neagh an internationally significant site for overwintering birds in the 1980s. In the years since, their numbers have plummeted. A 2013 study found that the number of these winter migratory birds at the lough had dropped nearly 80% in a decade – from 100,000 to fewer than 21,000.

“We’re looking out there – at the same spot – now,” Breen says. “There’s a wee flock of coot and no ducks. None. So there’s been a catastrophic collapse in duck numbers from when I started.”

Overwintering whooper swans from Iceland used to arrive as December approached. “For many years, they would herald the winter coming in,” says Tom McElhone, who lives near a disused freshwater laboratory at Traád Point on the lough’s north-western shore – its last major research facility, which closed in the early 2000s.

“I remember lying in bed and hearing these swans calling out to each other, up and down the lough, having this magnificent conversation at all hours of the night. That’s all gone.”

Even when they move away from it, Lough Neagh courses through the veins of those like Coney, raised on its south-western shores, who have worked the water or resided within one of its many tight-knit local communities.

The 53-year-old believes, however, that many of the social ties and customs that helped fuse together these shoreline villages, parishes and townlands have unravelled during his lifetime, mirroring a progressive decline of the lough’s central fishing industry.

As the number of boats fishing the waters has dwindled – from more than 200 in the 1980s to a few dozen today – so too, he says, have the summer fairs and “lough shore tug of wars”, the ad-hoc music sessions, hyperlocal vernacular – even residents’ familiarity with the water body itself.

“The local knowledge is not there any more,” he says. “And that sense of togetherness along the lough shore is just gone.”

Along the walls of the Toome Canal, at the north-western tip of Lough Neagh, chalk-like bright blue residue from the algal blooms was visible for weeks after the thick sludge of surface algae had disappeared from sight. Warning signs have remained in place at sites such as Ballyronan throughout the Christmas holidays and into early 2024.

The algal growths have robbed people not only of this year’s summer craic – families around the lough, say – but also of something calming, restorative, even “healing”.

And they have also prompted a belated “awakening” to the lough’s plight, in the words of the lough shore resident and former MP for Mid-Ulster, Bernadette McAliskey (nee Devlin).

She and other veteran civil rights leaders – who took up the cause of the area’s disfranchised fishers in the 1960s – have been speaking up for the lough once again.

Addressing a rain-drenched demonstration by the same canal in late November, just a stone’s throw from the eel fishery’s headquarters, McAliskey cited talks to bring the lough into a community co-operative trust nearly a decade ago. It was one of a number of lost opportunities for public ownership over the past 50 years.

“Our evidence was [that] people look after what belongs to them,” she said.

Ownership of Lough Neagh has a long and contentious history. The aristocratic Shaftesbury family has claimed the lough’s bed, banks and soil since the 19th century, having been given the asset by the Chichester family, whose territorial claim dates back to the Plantation of Ulster in the early 1600s.

The lough’s fishing communities were once bound together by a history of struggle in defending public rights to fish the lough that, in the words of House of Lords judges at a key 1911 appeal case, had been exercised “from time immemorial”. But now, Coney says, many have become despondent due to mismanagement of the water body, and a “lack of industry support” or apparent outside interest.

Those who fish for the increasingly emaciated, scattered eels only managed three weeks last season, which would usually run from May to late October.

The lough’s ecological and economic decline is now playing out amid fragmented management structures, and a lack of key scientific data – ecological “baselines”.

Local communities fear that the lough may be sold on to a new private owner – a prospect the 12th Earl of Shaftesbury has not ruled out publicly. Among many, there is a profound lack of trust or confidence in management and governing bodies.

“The priority has to be sustaining the life of the lough,” McAliskey told the Toome rally. “Because if we sustain the life of Lough Neagh together, Lough Neagh will sustain the rest of us. So long as we work in harmony with her, there is a living [here] for everybody.

“This whole lough could be an income generator that keeps all of our young people from emigrating to the cities and emigrating out of the country. We could have a really good life around this lough, while supporting the rest of the ecology.”

But Breen, who has also worked in government, is less optimistic.

“They’re hoping this will blow over, now the algae’s disappeared from sight”, he says of decision-makers and government, “and that it’ll be back to business as usual.”",19 Feb 2024 10:04:47

Starch-based feedstocks encompass grains like corn and wheat and tubers such as (sweet) potatoes and cassava. These feedstocks are rich in intricate chains of sugar molecules, making them readily convertible into fermentable sugars. These sugars can then undergo conversion into ethanol or drop-in fuels. Also, the fibrous components of these plants, such as wheat straw or corn stover, hold the potential for transformation into advanced Biofuel Industry, as seen in the case of cellulosic ethanol production.

## Biofuel Industry are a never-ending, environmentally friendly fuel derived from Biomass.

Biofuels are viewed as clean and among the most readily accessible fuels globally. They are sourced from biomass like wood and straw, achieved through the direct burning of dry matter, transforming into gaseous or liquid fuel. Other origins encompass organic materials such as sludge, sewage, and vegetable oils, which can be transformed into biofuels through a wet process like digestion and fermentation.

## Types of Biofuel Industry

Biofuels are widely accessible across the globe and typically include the following fuel types:

* Biodiesel
* Bioethanol
* Bioethanol

Among these, bioethanol and biodiesel stand out as the most prevailing types of biofuels currently used, representing the first generation of biofuel technology.

### Generations and Promising Sources Of Biofuel Production from Plant Resources

The generation of biofuel from botanical resources involves using materials like timber, straw and household refuse to generate heat and power. Also, biofuels can be derived from animal fats, botanical byproducts, and various organic waste materials from living organisms.

### This progression is categorised into three distinct types:

* First-generation: Biofuels primarily originate from consumable sources like sugar, [**starch**](https://bluecraftagro.com/product/food-grade-starch/), and other food crops cultivated on arable land.
* Second generation: Biofuels are produced using non-edible plant substances, including dry plant matter, woody biomass, [**agricultural**](https://bluecraftagro.com/)  remains and detritus.
* Third generation: Biofuels predominantly stem from algae and microorganisms, known for their high yield potential.

Also, the jatropha, belonging to the spurge family and containing a genus of flowering plants, is a notable [**biofuel industry**](https://bluecraftagro.com/product-category/oil-gas/)  across various global regions.

### The Biofuel Production Process

**Phase 1:**

Carefully selected plant crops are allowed to bask openly under the sun’s warmth.

**Phase 2:**

Subsequently, these cultivated crops undergo thorough refining procedures within factory settings to yield various food products.

**Phase 3:**

Following the creation of [**food products**](https://bluecraftagro.com/blog/exploring-the-role-of-starches-in-the-food-industry/), these crops are again subjected to refinement geared towards biofuel production.

**Phase 4:**

Upon the successful generation of biofuels, they are meticulously gathered into storage tanks and readied for subsequent processes.

#### The biomass or raw materials used for crafting biofuels include:

* Grain starch for bioethanol production: Comprising crops such as[ **corn and wheat.**](https://bluecraftagro.com/)
* Sugar crops for bioethanol production: Including sugarcane and sugar beets.
* Oilseed crops for biodiesel production: Encompassing soybeans, rapeseeds, palm oil, cooking oil, and various tropical oilseeds.

#### Also, cellulosic biomass serves as a crucial resource for bioethanol production and includes:

* Residues from forests.
* Municipal solid waste.
* Managed biomass, which incorporates trees and grass.
* Crop remnants include corn stover, wheat straw, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse.

#### Advantages of Biofuel

* Promotes public health by reducing toxic emissions.
* Contributes to a cleaner environment.
* Eliminates hazardous gases like Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Sulphur Oxide (SO) emissions.
* Reduces the risk of cancer and respiratory issues in humans due to non-toxic emissions.
* Mitigates the threat of global warming, making it eco-friendly.

#### Disadvantages of Biofuel

* Disruption of natural life cycles.
* High labour costs and significant storage space requirements.
* Increased water consumption, particularly in arid regions.
* Elevated demand for agricultural land when cultivating biomass for biofuel production.

##### The Rationale for Biofuel Adoption

Biofuels present various advantages and drawbacks concerning their impact on environmental, economic, and social sustainability. Globally, the foremost biofuel drivers revolve around reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, bolstering energy security by decreasing crude oil imports and fostering rural development. These same advantages align with the findings of the Niti Aayog report, encompassing enhanced energy security through potential crude oil import reductions, increased engagement of local entrepreneurs and sugarcane farmers in the energy sector and reduced vehicular emissions. While the advantages for farmers are unmistakable, as any surge in demand for crops, not limited to biofuel crops, benefits them, the energy and environmental gains are nuanced and heavily contingent on specific contexts.

##### Net Energy Balance

The overall energy ratio (OER), which signifies the ratio of energy delivered by a fuel (be it petroleum or biofuel) to the total energy inputs required for its production, exhibits its highest value for gasoline and its lowest for cellulosic ethanol. However, using renewable energy sources to produce biofuels results in a lower fossil energy ratio (FER), representing the ratio of liquid energy output to fossil energy input. Gasoline maintains an FER equivalent to its OER at approximately 0.8, while Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol boasts an FER of about 10. The notably high FER for sugarcane-based ethanol can be attributed to the substantial contribution of energy from sugarcane fibre in its production process. Although specific FER estimates for Indian ethanol are unavailable, they are likely to be lower than those for Brazilian ethanol, as the latter is consistently rated as the most energy-efficient biofuel in numerous studies.",12 Feb 2024 07:03:04
66,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpeculativeEvolution/comments/1aor825/a_terrestrial_wetland_equivalent_to_coral_reefs/,A terrestrial (wetland) equivalent to coral reefs,"Coral reefs are incredibly beautiful and diverse environments, but they're limited to marine environments due to the biology and limitations of the corals themselves.

Corals feed on zooplankton that is abundant in their circulating waters, but circulating air is comparatively poor in floating organisms. Any hard corals would also run into the issue of acquiring enough minerals to build their skeleton. Along with that, there's also the issue of reproduction, with corals relying on water currents to reproduce, which prevents them from moving upstream and into terrestrial areas. This all makes it very unlikely for any corals to evolve to live on the land, but other groups could create similar habitats, with one such group being fungi.

Swamps and other wetlands have lots of dead organic matter to decompose, but their soils and waters are too oxygen-poor for fungi to break it down. This could be solved if fungi were to evolve to be colonial and create large spires like [prototaxites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototaxites). These towers could function as respiratory organs, pulling in oxygen-rich air from above the water and bringing it down to the rest of the fungus. These towers could also assist in reproduction by allowing for easier spore dispersal.

Some of these fungi could become symbiotic with various algae or other plants to provide additional energy and oxygen while the plants receive abundant nutrients. These fungal towers and their various symbiotes could produce a wide array of pigments, either to show their toxicity in the case of the fungi or to perform photosynthesis in the case of the algae.

This would produce a dynamic ecosystem similar to coral reefs that could thrive in wetland environments, making these already diverse areas even richer in biodiversity and life.

If these toxins were to be carried into cloud formations and subsequently deposited in an area with caribou through precipitation, it could potentially affect their neurological systems. However, the feasibility of this scenario occurring in the Arctic, and specifically through clouds, is highly speculative and unprecedented in scientific literature.

> Volcanic Gases: Volcanic eruptions can release a variety of gases, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S), into the atmosphere. These gases can travel long distances and, under specific atmospheric conditions, could potentially be associated with cloud formations. High concentrations of these gases can have toxic effects on wildlife, including disorientation or panic. However, the presence and effect of such gases in the Arctic region, transported by clouds, would be a rare event.

> Anthropogenic Chemicals: Industrial pollutants and chemicals can travel long distances in the atmosphere. Certain chemicals, if present in high concentrations, could potentially cause disorientation or neurological effects in wildlife. This would require a significant and concentrated release of chemicals that somehow become encapsulated within cloud formations and then precipitated out, which is a highly speculative scenario.

> Mycotoxins from Fungi: Certain types of fungi produce mycotoxins that can be harmful to animals and humans. In theory, spores from these fungi could become airborne and, under the right conditions, could be involved in cloud formation or precipitation, leading to exposure in wildlife. This scenario, however, is highly speculative and there's no direct evidence to suggest it occurs in nature in the manner described.

> Natural Gas Emissions: Methane and other natural gases can seep from the ground in areas rich in organic deposits or where there is geothermal activity. If such gases were somehow to become concentrated in cloud formations and affect animal behavior, it would represent a novel and undocumented phenomenon.

> It's crucial to emphasize that these scenarios are speculative and not based on documented scientific phenomena. The direct link between specific substances in clouds causing hallucinations or panic in caribou herds would require a novel mechanism of environmental interaction that has yet to be observed or studied in detail. Realistically, environmental stressors that lead to panic or unusual behavior in wildlife are often more terrestrial or direct in nature, such as predation pressure, human activity, or direct exposure to toxins in their environment.

I find both toxic algal blooms and mycotoxins from fungi particularly fascinating here, as Clark was specifically researching cyanobacteria and Alternaria (black mold).

Asking a followup: ""Could the absence of sunlight contribute to any of these factors?""

> Changes in Microbial Activity: The absence of sunlight can alter the temperature and moisture conditions in the environment, which can affect microbial and fungal activity. In theory, increased fungal activity could lead to higher concentrations of spores or mycotoxins in the environment. While this could affect animal health if ingested or inhaled directly, the connection to cloud-borne substances is speculative.

The timing of the black water appearing in the Villages is the same as the last sunset, is the same as the caribou herd freakout, is the same as Clark's seizure, etc. They all have the absence of light in common.

In another post I shared a research paper studying the impact of blue light and its absence on black mold. Blue light increases mycotoxin production by 2-3x, and it's absence causes spore proliferation.

Abnormal amounts of blue-green light also turns cyanobacteria... orange. In the opening credits, twice we see a setup of blue-green lights surrounding one orange rod. What were they doing there?",08 Feb 2024 15:00:09

77,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaticSnails/comments/1akhf7n/mystery_snails_neurotoxins_tiger_barbs_seeking/,"Mystery Snails, Neurotoxins, Tiger Barbs- seeking clarification","SO- Our tank has a bit of black algae that I'm keeping more or less under control with some thorough scrubbing and scraping during water changes. But, to help me out and to perhaps even nix it completely (lol, I know, let me dream) I am looking into mystery snails as an add-on to my clean up crew. Previously I had brought on board a SAE but he didn't end up lasting long- my suspicion is he got too stressed by his tankmates. We then brought in a nerite (onion snail variety), and the barbs straight-up stressed it to death in 2 days.

The tank is the 45-ish gallon bowfront that Fluval makes (actual volume something like 46.7 gallons?), with a Fluval 406 for a filter. Lots of java ferns, some anubias, some hygrophila that refuses to stay in my substrate so I just let it float, and a whole schwack of hornwort. Livestock are a Bristlenose Pleco, a pair of Otos (hoping to get them some friends soon), 8 zebra danios and 13 Glo Tiger Barbs. We don't have a huge amount of hardscape hidey-holes, but we've got two caves plus a big cavernish centerpiece and all the roots you could ask for plus some wood for the BN to rasp at.

The question is- I keep seeing mixed things on the supposed toxicity of Mystery Snails. I hadn't come across any mention of it in my initial poking around, and it was only at my LFS that a staffer mentioned they don't carry them anymore because of some neurotoxin that's in them and their eggs. My plan had been to get one and if it happened to be female to then break up the egg sacs as a bit of a live food treat for the danios and tigers. Another LFS I went to had never heard of anything like this, and now that I'm looking for info on it online I keep getting the range between ""hell, you can eat 'em"" to ""wear gloves when taking the egg sacs out"". Our tiger barbs are a pretty rowdy shoal, apparently, so the likelihood they would give a mystery snail a few test nips while everyone's figuring each other out is pretty high, and they're not especially clever so I imagine the occasional nip may always be in the cards. Would I be endangering the barbs with a mystery snail in the tank? Conversely, can mystery snails handle the occasional abuse like that or should I look for something else that has a taste for black algae? It's a short list!

Any help or guidance anybody has would be greatly appreciated!",06 Feb 2024 13:57:09

88,https://www.reddit.com/r/BugBane/comments/19e7v3v/effective_natural_fire_ant_control_methods_a/,Effective Natural Fire Ant Control Methods: A Chemical-Free Approach,"Fire ants are notorious for their painful stings and the rapid spread of their colonies. While chemical treatments are common, they can be harmful to the environment and other beneficial insects. Fortunately, there are natural, effective ways to control fire ants without resorting to harsh chemicals. In this article, we'll explore several methods of natural fire ant control, providing a safer alternative for both your family and the ecosystem.

1. Boiling Water: One of the simplest and most immediate methods to deal with a fire ant mound is pouring boiling water over it. This method can eliminate a significant portion of the ants, including the queen if the water reaches her. However, it may require multiple applications and can affect surrounding plant life.
2. Diatomaceous Earth (DE): Diatomaceous earth is a natural, powdery substance made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of algae. When sprinkled around ant mounds, DE works by absorbing the oils in the exoskeletons of ants, causing them to dehydrate and die. It's a non-toxic option and is safe for use around pets and children.
3. Biological Control: Introducing natural predators of fire ants can be an effective long-term solution. For example, phorid flies are known to parasitize fire ants. Releasing these flies in areas heavily infested with fire ants can help keep their population in check. This method works best as part of an integrated pest management strategy.
4. Baiting with Boric Acid: Boric acid, a naturally occurring mineral, can be used as a bait for fire ants. Mix a small amount with a sweet substance like sugar to attract ants. The ants carry the bait back to the colony, eventually killing the queen and other ants. This method is slower but effective for long-term control.
5. Essential Oils: Certain essential oils, such as peppermint, citrus, and tea tree oil, have shown effectiveness in repelling fire ants. These can be diluted with water and sprayed directly onto ant mounds or around areas where you want to deter ants. It's a natural and pleasant-smelling option, though reapplication is necessary for continued effectiveness.

Conclusion: Natural methods of fire ant control are not only environmentally friendly but also safer for humans and pets. While these methods may require more patience and persistence than chemical treatments, they offer a sustainable solution to fire ant infestations. For more detailed information and additional natural fire ant control strategies, visit BugBane's comprehensive guide at [BugBane](https://bugbane.com.au/fire-ants-control-without-chemicals/).

Remember, it's essential to understand the specific needs and challenges of your environment when dealing with fire ants. Natural control methods can be highly effective when used correctly and consistently.",23 Jan 2024 22:48:51
89,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaticSnails/comments/19cktbd/list_of_things_aquatic_snails_love_to_eat_and/,List of things aquatic snails love to eat (and things they shouldnt),"It's a common question on here: what should I feed my snails? It's a very good question and the answer is extremely varied. Thankfully for the most common aquatic snail species (mystery/apple, ramshorn, pond/bladder, rabbit), they share a general list of foods they can and cannot eat! Feel free to add ideas, give your own experiences, corrections, etc etc. 

Staples/can be fed regularly: zucchini, broccoli, green beans, dandelion greens, arugula, dark leafy greens, kelp/sea weed, spirulina, clover,  black soldier fly larvae, dried shrimp/krill, bloodworms, tubifex worms,  decaying leaves and plant matter (almond leaves/catappa leaves are a common choice), high quality foods formulated specifically for aquatic invertebrates and bottom feeders! Over time, you will  be able to faciliate a well rounded, healthy aquatic enviorment able to host a natural balance of biofilm and algae that will also naturally feed your snails, and this will be a staple for them too. 

Nice additions but dont go overboard: pretty much any fruit or sweet veggie: carrots, apples, berries, butternut squash, sweet potato, as well as greens high in oxalates: kale, spinach. They also like things like sweet pepper, brussel sprouts, ripe plantain, parsnip, and mushrooms. Algae wafers! Shrimp sticks! 

Just as a treat/not too often: bananas, cucumbers (this is the definition of a treat, its almost nutritionally void), melon (same deal), , peas, and really sweet fruits like grapes, mango, peaches, apricot, berries, etc etc. Occasional additions of crush egg shell is very much appreciated on top of their regular calcium supplements. Shrimp 'snowflake' food, a common treat for shrimp, snails can enjoy it too in moderation. 

Big no nos: celery, chard, chicory, chives, endive, garlic, onion,  iceberg lettuce, avocado, citrus, cornmeal (sometimes used as filler in certain cheap pet foods), rhubarb, pineapple, leeks, starchy varieties of potato, mint, parsley..anything salty or processed, of course. Fish flakes or foods intended for anything but aquatic invertebrates. While it's (usually) fine for them to scavenge this, they cannot survive on just what the fish miss, and the fish food often lacks all the nutrients a snail needs anyhow. 

Other general points:

-Avoid feeding your tank any fish food that uses copper proteinate/copper ammino acid chelate, a common preservative in pet foods that can be toxic to snails. Also avoid feeding your tank foods where the 'fish meal' is one of the first ingredients, it indicates low quality ingredients.

-Good calcium supplements: unflavored cuttlebone, unflavored tums, crush eggshell, shells, sand dollars, crush oyster shell, crushed coral

-food such as fibrous veggies can be lightly blanched (placed in boiling water for a few moments then directly into ice water) to soften it for them. 

-snails can get addicted to eating things like cucumbers and bananas (yeah you read that right), so feed in moderation.

Real Benefits?,"Can’t seem to figure out which foods will keep you full for long hours? Struggling to find supplements or drinks that are healthy for the gut and overall mood? These are critical thoughts, seeing how the gut influences mood, brain health, and around-the-clock wellness. Our team of researchers has been continually looking for simple, effective ways to ease digestion, support gut health, and help individuals feel full after eating healthily. While doing so, we discovered a unique product beyond the aforementioned. Let’s get right to it. Here’s everything there is to know about Green Glucose.

## What is Green Glucose?

[Green Glucose is a powdered nutritional supplement](https://reviewermart.com/2024/01/19/green-glucose-reviews-2024-read-ingredients-warnings-price/) that, as the name implies, is intended to balance blood sugar levels. This formula consists of various ingredients in plants, adaptogenic herbs, vitamins, and minerals to eliminate cravings and improve satiety. As the creators underlined, these nutrient-dense sources might boost energy levels, aid digestion, and promote a healthy anti-inflammatory response.

Aside from the aforementioned, Green Glucose addresses other factors that cause blood sugar fluctuations, such as stress-induced overeating and poor gut health. The ingredients must be examined in greater depth to better understand what Green Glucose can accomplish for blood sugar levels.

## What are the main ingredients in Green Glucose?

The driving forces behind Green Glucose include:

## Spirulina

Spirulina \[[1](https://www.verywellhealth.com/spirulina-89079)\] is an alga in the Arthrospira genus. It’s high in fat-soluble vitamins, fatty acids, beta-carotene, and minerals, all contributing to its therapeutic properties. These include antioxidant action, blood pressure, and cholesterol regulation, and eased metabolic syndrome symptoms (one being blood sugar fluctuations). It is important to note that spirulina is unlikely to reverse serious damages caused by uncontrolled blood sugar, but it may lower blood sugar levels.

One probable explanation is that it contains fiber, which is known to increase satiety while also encouraging good gut health. It’s also worth mentioning that fiber and carbohydrates are absorbed differently. In the former situation, it passes directly through the digestive system, making it highly unlikely to elevate blood sugar levels. Most studies included a dose between 0.8 and 8g daily to positively affect fasting blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. Does this mean that the results are long-term? More research is needed on this front.

## Barley

Barley is a type of cereal grain. According to research on the influence of barley on health, individuals who consume it have a 17% lower risk of death from causes, including cancer and diabetes, than those whose diets contain fewer sources of whole grains. Barley might lower blood sugar and insulin levels, and its rich source of beta-glucan is said to slow the absorption of sugar (by binding to the digestive tract). Another probable explanation for these benefits is that it has a low glycemic index (GI). GI, as defined in one source, measures how quickly a food raises your blood sugar. Its fiber content also suggests healthy digestion and satiety.

## Wheatgrass

Wheatgrass (or Triticum aestivum plant is a superfood high in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals. As a result, it may aid digestion, boost immunity, and increase energy levels. In terms of digestion, wheat grass might assist the body in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients. Additionally, its cleansing properties may alleviate gas, bloating, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).

This nutrient-dense ingredient could potentially [aid in weight loss by](https://reviewermart.com/2024/01/19/green-glucose-reviews-2024-read-ingredients-warnings-price/) quickly increasing satiety and keeping people fuller for longer. The latter also reduces the desire for foods heavy in sugar or fat. Finally, several chemicals in wheatgrass have been shown to imitate the effects of insulin and lower the glycemic index of foods.

## Alfalfa

Alfalfa, or Medicago sativa, is a plant commonly used for livestock feed. Its exceptional vitamin, mineral, and protein content has recently been investigated for human consumption. One study found that alfalfa might lower total and LDL cholesterols and triglyceride levels while increasing good cholesterol levels. These outcomes are due to the herb’s high saponin content. Finally, alfalfa has been traditionally used as an anti-diabetic agent, promoting cardiometabolic health by lowering blood fat and blood sugar levels.

## Broccoli & Collard Greens

Broccoli is a cruciferous vegetable belonging to the cabbage family. In terms of health benefits, broccoli has been proven to reduce colon inflammation, lower the incidence of colon cancer, and possibly enhance gut health by protecting the gut lining from developing holes (i.e., leaky gut). Furthermore, it is high in fiber, which [could aid digestion](https://reviewermart.com/2024/01/19/green-glucose-reviews-2024-read-ingredients-warnings-price/). Most of all, the availability of sulforaphane has been linked to lowered blood sugar levels. As for collard greens, they are also cruciferous vegetables with high fiber and sulforaphane content.

## Spinach

Spinach is a type of leafy green vegetable belonging to the Amaranth family. It is high in minerals and antioxidants, which promote a healthy immune system and prevent the detrimental effects of inflammation on the body. Furthermore, the insoluble fiber content contributes bulk to stool as food passes through digestion, reducing constipation. However, spinach and similar foods have high vitamin K levels and may interfere with blood-thinning medications.

## Medicinal Mushrooms

The last ingredients are medicinal adaptogenic mushrooms: Cordyceps, Reishi, Turkey Tail, King Trumpet, Shiitake, and Lion’s Mane. Cordyceps is a type of fungus considered a staple in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Precisely, it has the potential to increase exercise performance and immune function, reduce inflammation, improve heart health, and lower blood sugar levels (in people with type 2 diabetes).

Unfortunately, the evidence on blood sugar is pretty weak, as most research has been conducted on animals, or the results are mixed. From what’s available in the scientific community, cordyceps might work by decreasing insulin resistance and protecting insulin-producing beta cells, but more studies are still needed to confirm this. The next fungus to have qualified is reishi.

Reishi mushrooms, commonly known as Ganoderma lucidum, are a fungus that grows in hot and humid locations in Asia. It is trusted to boost the immune system, exert anti-cancer properties, decrease fatigue and depression symptoms, and improve markers of heart health and blood sugar. Although these findings are attractive, studies on reishi’s potency are either outdated or lack substance. In this case, individuals will have to decide whether to focus primarily on science or traditional medicine.

Following suit, we have turkey tail, a medicinal mushroom that also happens to be rich in antioxidants. Scientifically known as Trametes versicolor, studies on turkey tail have concluded that it might strengthen the immune system, balance gut bacteria and possibly treat certain cancers. As for its impact on blood sugar, this ingredient might lower pre- and post-workout levels. Moreover, results derived from animal subjects have reported improved insulin resistance, but it is unclear whether humans can achieve similar results.

King trumpet, scientifically known as pleurotus eryngii, is a mushroom filled with many vitamins, dietary fibers, and amino acids and low in calories. Ingesting this mushroom variety is poised to improve gut health, boost immune function, lower cholesterol levels, reduce toxicity, and manage symptoms associated with diabetes. With respect to blood sugar levels, king trumpet’s beta-glucan levels are believed to improve insulin resistance, which, as noted earlier, lowers blood sugar.

Shiitake mushrooms are commonly found in many supplements due to their low-carb and low-sugar nature. In fact, it is a low glycemic index food and possesses diabetes-fighting properties. Studies conducted on animals with type 2 diabetes show that polysaccharides may reduce blood sugar levels, improve insulin resistance, and lower pancreatic tissue damage. Additionally, its abundance of polysaccharides might further stabilize blood sugar levels.

Lion’s mane mushroom, scientifically known as Yamabushitake, is commonly used for its culinary and medicinal properties. They are said to contain bioactive substances attributed to improved brain, heart, and gut health. The studies conducted on animals show that lion’s mane might significantly reduce blood sugar levels in normal and diabetic mice with low dosages. Since these studies are conducted on mice, it is hard to say whether humans will receive the same benefits.

95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChillingApp/comments/19937g8/a_modest_proposal_for_madame_and_her_shotgun/,A Modest Proposal for Madame and her Shotgun," I hate how the sky glows orange at night. A myriad of electric beams erupt from every house and building, blurring out the stars with its toxic plume of light. Of course, it wasn’t always that way. I remember showers of shooting stars that would leave glowing trails in the inky blackness for a fleeting moment. And on moonless nights, my brothers and I would exclaim how we couldn’t see our own hands in front of our faces. 

Now, I must seek out the dark within the drains and tunnels below. 

I lay down and stretch my matchstick legs within the cool annals of my favorite culvert, listening to the burbling and gurgling of the river below. The air is humid and stagnant. There’s no wind to carry away the stench of rotting algae and dead fish, but I don’t mind the smell so much. I use my sharpest fingernail to pry the flesh from between a carp’s ribs. The fish is enough to dampen my hunger pangs, but it doesn’t squelch them, entirely. I’m simply biding my time until the hour is late enough to safely travel above ground—to the cemetery, over the hill. 

The fish bones are discarded in a pile, as I reach for my leather purse of coins. Most of the coins were paid to me during my life as a tradesman, copper *liards,* and *deniers*. I turn out the purse into my hand; some of the coins miss my palm and fall onto the concrete floor with a *plink*\-clang. I relish in the cold weight of each coin on my palm and run my fingers over its bumpy lettering before it’s counted and dropped back into the purse.

A few days prior, I felt a sequence of vibrations run through the eastern sewer drain that indicated an excavation at the nearby cemetery. The vibrations worked like a dinner bell and whipped my hunger into a frenzy. I waited day and night for any indication of an incoming burial, and my answer came early this morning in the form of a black, glossy rock at the head of a small plot. The face of the square plaque bore the name *Chance Fournier,* with an etching of a smiling baby boy. My heart leaped in my chest and I slapped my thigh in excitement.

You see, I like children the best. 

Eating little ones doesn’t come with the set of difficulties that come with eating adults: there aren’t as many muscles, or these days especially, slabs of fat to eat around. I can get more edible meat from a small child than an entire adult male—with a fraction of the effort! 

For the rest of the morning, I stayed crouched in the sewer drain on the opposite side of the street from the cemetery. The cemetery itself sits atop a grassy hill and is surrounded on all sides by a squat green fence—presumably to keep out the ruffians who run the streets day and night. The grass is often too long this time of year. To add to its aura of dereliction, several monuments lie crumbling, their marble fragments littering the ground beneath them. Pity. 

I was impatient for the funeral procession to arrive and pulled myself up to the iron grate periodically to spy on the scene. A smile cracked open half my face when I saw the hearse and its entourage pull in from the street. Slowly, all the mourners began pouring out of their vehicles and I realized I had seen this large *métis* family before. Their noxious mix of perfumes hit me across the street and I held my nose as I watched two men and a woman assist the ancient matriarch out of the car. The younger woman pulled out a purple-colored walking chair and positioned it in front of her elder to grab onto. It wasn’t until I finally noticed the jeweled turban wrapped around her shrunken little head that I remembered who she was. I inhaled sharply at the recollection, and my elongated fingers were gripping the iron bars so tightly that I accidentally popped the grate right off its cradle.

It’s been nearly twenty years since Madame and I went toe-to-toe over one of her grandsons. The woman has now endured the deaths of her husband (too stringy), a niece (drugs, the body was inedible. Consuming formaldehyde is bad enough.), several cousins (all old), a grandson, and judging by the smell of it, now her great-grandson. The weight of tragedy has pulled her down into a frail prune of a woman, who was trudging behind her family members with the aid of that metal contraption. 

When I last saw her, I had just snaked my way through the cemetery to her teenage grandson’s burial site. It must’ve been just before the witching hour, and a crescent moon hung in the sky like an antique fingernail clipping. Crickets chirped all around us, as I sat there wondering why the hell an old woman would be sitting in the graveyard at night, accompanied only by a burning, white candle. Her presence made me nervous, but she looked sound asleep sitting in her plastic chair and cocooned in blankets. I noticed a purple metallic cane propped up on her side. If I woke her, I could run away before she realized what I was.

So, I jumped into the plot and began pulling off the cement lid of the burial vault. I made it to the casket nestled inside when *Paf*! I felt a sharp cuff to the back of my head. I snapped around and saw Madame standing over me, arm and cane poised to strike again. Her expression was stern, a face held in place by a spider’s web of wrinkles. She wore a perfume that smelled something like dead lilies and talc, forcing a shudder through my body now it was hitting me in full force. Since it was too late to not be seen, I decided to try and scare her away. I flashed my double rows of pointed teeth and pretended to lunge for her when she thwacked me over the head again. 

Unharmed but terribly annoyed, I reached to snatch the cane from her when, out from the pile of blankets, tumbled a small, wire-haired terrier. It locked eyes with me and immediately began shrieking, foamy spittle flying from its gleaming fangs. My chest tightened and I found myself creeping backward. Any dog bite has the potential to wreak havoc on my delicate biology. The pocket-sized beast sensed my aversion and it closed the distance between us in two lunges. 

I forgot myself altogether and ran into the fence that surrounds the cemetery, propelling myself over it before falling several feet down into the road below. 

I will never forgive this indignity. 

The glaring summer sun had finally tucked itself beyond the horizon. The city noise calms to a hush, allowing the nocturnal insects to communicate with each other. I search for debris caked in between my toes that comes off with a good scratch, and I realize I’m stalling. Surely the woman is too ancient to be out at night by herself—she was already elderly before! 

A frog croaks below, giving me a start. I pop out of the culvert to flail an arm in its direction and vow to devour him, later. The sudden movement reawakens the gnawing hunger. I wrap my arms around my stomach and the decision is made.

My culvert connects to the main sewer, in addition to several clay drain tiles. This network of pipes allows me to travel anywhere in the city. The cement feels cool on my hands and feet as I glide up the main line, and water from a recent rain trickles in between my fingers and toes. Soon enough, I arrive at the sewer drain, outside of the cemetery. I compact my form to squeeze out the metal grate and crawl out onto the street. I hit on a few smells, the strongest coming from a dead raccoon in the middle of the street. Its greyish-purple intestines are smashed all around its stiffened corpse like a petti skirt. I can ignore it today. 

The boy’s flower wreath is still standing alongside its gravesite—it’s a lovely memorial with white and blue flowers, displaying a silk banner that reads “Forever our Baby.” My eyes drift to either side of the grave and on the left-hand side, I scry the outline of Madame. As soon as I notice her, I catch the ick of her perfume over the roadkill beyond the cemetery gate. 

“Yeah, I see yo’ slimy bitch ass!”

She yells her language at me and I can guess at is meaning. She means to threaten me. I search her all over for any sign of a dog but find none. What I do see, however, is a type of rifle clutched to her bosom. 

How silly.

Madame racks a round of ammunition and I decide to take shelter behind a tall headstone so I may come up with a better plan. 

Cheek pressed to the lichen-encrusted marble, I lay there wishing I were able to explain to her how the circle of life works. Her grandson isn’t in that dead body—he’s just on the other side of the veil, waiting for her to sing him another song and to cuddle her withered breast. I’ve seen these entities before, even though I cannot be among them. Besides, Mother Earth and her creatures don’t need the preservation chemicals or the encasements. These bodies must be allowed to decay. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes—

*“PAN!”* 

Madame fires a shot that a hear ricochet off the memorial behind which I’m taking refuge. A fresh surge of hunger erupts in my belly and I throw my hands up in a plea to no one. I cannot go another day subsisting on the mushy carp flesh. A clump of ebony hair falls before my eyes; I absent-mindedly loop it around my finger until it forms a nice curl. I doubt any bullets could *kill* me, but I don’t want to take the chance of bleeding out. Black sludge pumps through my veins in memory of what I once was—alive and happy. My hunger renders everything a blur and I make the resolution that either she goes or I go.

I shift to bring my feet closer to me when they graze a large stone. I snatch it up and see it’s the crown piece to a broken monument. I abandon my romantic thoughts and hurl the ornate carving at Madame’s head. It goes wide. (I lament it’s been a lifetime since the neighborhood kids played baseball at the local park.) She fiddles with her gun and I see she’s loading a yellow cylinder into it. Sitting directly behind her, I spot an enormous obelisk with a bad lean. A new plan is hatched in my atrophied mind. I take the opportunity for Madame’s delay and make a dash for the caretaker’s shed. 

From one of my previous rendezvous, I remember the caretaker always having pine wood blocks on hand inside the garage. Its interior is musty from disuse. A vagabond sleeps in the corner. I move quietly as to not wake him until I catch the familiar whiff of whisky. He won’t be causing any more trouble tonight. My fingers clutch a workable block of oak as I search the cluttered shelves for my piéce de r**es**istance: a long, steel pry bar. I find it leaning in the far corner, hidden behind the ruins of a vintage lawn tractor. Tools in hand, I felt a wave of nostalgia for my employment. At least now I could come face to face with Madame in a good mood.

Back outside, the katydids had begun their rhythmic song up in the cypress trees, many of which were rotting from the inside out. I could also smell Madame and the sweat of anticipation mixed with her perfume. My white, luminescent skin puts me at a disadvantage, even in the weak moonlight, so I fell to all fours and crawled in a wide circle, destined for the leaning obelisk. I move as silently as I can while still keeping an eye on Madame. It occurs to me that her mobility is greatly limited, as she tries in vain to turn in her chair for a better vantage point. I slither in between headstones, footstones, and monuments until I arrive at the obelisk. I peek around the corner and she has not heard me. I make my hands like woodchuck paws and dig up the ground at the great stone’s base. When I’m satisfied, I place the block parallel to the base’s edge for leverage and stick the curved end of the pry bar underneath the stone. I pause briefly when I hear Madame mumble something to herself in a satisfactory tone as if she believes she’s scared me off. I peer over the smooth edge of the monument to gaze at Madame one last time. I make a silent promise not to eat her corpse. It would be the most respectable thing for me to do. I return to my work and lift the bottom of the obelisk with the bar. I give it a helping push with the palm of my hand. 

In Madame’s feeble state, she isn’t able to dodge the falling stone but certainly has enough time to know it’s coming. I hear the stone smash her open like a gourd. I amble over, stopping to consider the blood-splattered wheel of her walking chair. It’s still spinning from the impact but gradually slows. I loathe what I’ve done, but I’ve already suffered the consequences. 

I side-step down into the burial plot and marvel at its minuscule accouterments. They’ve even stamped an imprint of a lamb onto the casket liner. I glance behind me at Madame’s ruined body and gasp when the walker wheel begins to spin again. A cold, nocturnal breeze blows through.

# How War Affects the Black Sea and Marine Life

[The coast of the Black Sea. Photo by Serhii Sverdelov](https://preview.redd.it/t5qsl8acqhcc1.png?width=1333&format=png&auto=webp&s=f901461ca6e9152fafd9a3eaa69fd15e1b8740d9)

In 1996, the six coastal states of the Black Sea signed the Strategic Action Plan for the Environmental Protection and Rehabilitation of the Black Sea. This plan was necessitated by the alarming destruction of the Black Sea’s unique natural complexes due to human impact. Today, the urgency to preserve the Black Sea is greater than ever as it faces the repercussions of the Russian invasion. How is the war affecting the Black Sea, and what measures can be taken to mitigate the consequences for both nature and humanity?

Together with a marine biologist and a specialist from the climate department at NGO Ecoaction, Sofiia Sadohurska, we dive into details about the uniqueness of the Black Sea, why its biodiversity needs to be protected, and how the war affects its ecosystem. We will also discover if there is any hope for the sea’s restoration and how to overcome the consequences of war.

# The Black Sea before the war VS now

The Black Sea and its coastlines hold cherished memories for millions. For thousands of years, this region has been a nexus of trade routes between Europe and Asia, rendering it significant from both biological and geographical perspectives. It is a unique sea basin, characterised by distinct climatic conditions, natural factors, and a rich biodiversity.

The Black Sea is an extraordinary body of water, distinct from other seas and oceans. Geographically, it is a semi-enclosed sea, completely encircled by land, with limited connection to the World Ocean through a system of straits. It receives fresh water from multiple rivers, resulting in the Black Sea’s salinity being almost half that of ocean waters. Another unique feature of the Black Sea is its status as the world’s largest meromictic basin, meaning its upper water layer does not mix with the lower, oxygen-depleted layer rich in hydrogen sulphide, which accounts for over 80% of the sea’s total volume. Consequently, its rich biodiversity is confined to the oxygen-rich upper layer.

The current sea basin formed just 6–8 thousand years ago with the emergence of the Bosphorus strait, allowing the saline waters of the Mediterranean to mix with the existing freshwater basin. The Black Sea’s biodiversity comprises ancient species and those introduced from the Mediterranean. The combination of these exceptional conditions and the sea’s isolation have fostered a unique biodiversity, including endemic species found nowhere else in the world.

However, its semi-enclosed nature and the large volume of oxygen-depleted waters render the Black Sea particularly susceptible to human activity and climate change.

Despite challenges, since the 1990s, there has been hope for the revival of marine life in the Black Sea. Scientists have observed signs of ecosystem restoration in its northern part, particularly due to a reduction in biogenic substances flowing from rivers, which in turn has lessened the concentration of organic compounds in the Black Sea’s shelf area. However, the Russian invasion commenced in 2014 poses a significant threat to the Black Sea’s condition. The impact of Russian occupation and warfare is multifaceted and complex, disrupting not only regional security but also altering sea transportation routes and water management and hindering decades of scientific research by Ukrainian scientists. It has emerged as a new ecological challenge.

Military activities harm the nature reserve fund, leading to sea pollution from sunken equipment and damaged coastal infrastructure, and adversely affect the coastal ecosystems.

# Impact of the war on seas and coastal Areas

Since the Russian-Ukrainian war erupted in 2014, numerous protected areas have fallen under Russian occupation. Many suffer from inadequate protection and altered statuses, while others are directly impacted by the actions of the occupiers. A notable example is the militarisation of Crimea, including military exercises in or near protected zones. The Russians have conducted extensive military drills near Cape Chauda on the Kerch Peninsula, adversely affecting the steppe, coastal, and marine ecosystems of the Opuk Nature Reserve. In areas of intense militarisation and training, a significant amount of ammunition has been used, particularly at sea, causing harm to living organisms and contaminating soil, air, and water.

Protected areas have also suffered damage or destruction due to natural resource depletion and quarry construction. For instance, the Bakal Spit in northern Crimea, a regional landscape park, experienced illegal sand mining by the occupiers for various construction projects on the peninsula. Furthermore, large-scale infrastructure projects pose additional risks. The infamous Kerch Bridge, built in 2018, could have altered ecosystems and hydrogeological conditions in the Kerch Strait and the entire Azov Sea. The construction of this bridge virtually destroyed the natural habitats on Tuzla Island in the Kerch Strait and disrupted the migration routes of marine animals.

With the onset of the full-scale Russian war against Ukraine, the impact on the seas has intensified. Protected areas along the Black and Azov Seas are suffering from both occupation and hostilities. All of Ukraine’s marine nature reserves, along with seven coastal national nature parks and one biosphere reserve, are currently under occupation. These areas, encompassing a diverse range of habitats like seagrass meadows, underwater seaweed forests, dunes, and lagoons, were established to safeguard the unique marine and coastal ecosystems of the Black and Azov Seas.

Certain territories, like the Kinburn Spit or Dzharylhach Island in the Black Sea, face direct hostilities or have Russian troops present. The building of fortifications and trenches, along with the movement of military equipment and frequent explosions, are damaging vegetation and soil. Fires, ignited both by combat and other factors, add to the devastation. Occupation exacerbates the issue, with the occupiers mining lands and destroying firefighting equipment. The Kinburn Spit alone witnessed 131 fires in the first year of the full-scale invasion, marking 2022 as the year with the largest fires in recent decades. These fires devastated over 5,000 hectares, impacting steppe and coastal ecosystems and the nesting sites of around 100 bird species.

Satellite data reveals that the occupiers are constructing fortifications in the coastal zone of the Crimean Peninsula, encroaching upon areas that are part of Ukraine’s Emerald Network. This network encompasses territories and waters dedicated to preserving habitats rare in Europe. Beyond the Emerald Network, the Black Sea coastline also features other vital areas for the conservation of species and habitats that are rare in Ukraine and globally.

The catastrophe at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant on June 6, 2023, resulting from the Russian detonation of the dam, significantly impacted nature conservation efforts. The flooding affected several nature reserves, including the Lower Dnipro National Nature Park, established to protect the natural floodplain complexes of the Dnipro Delta. This event posed a serious threat to the survival of various species and ecosystems.

# How Russia pollutes Ukrainian marine environment

The destruction of the Kakhovka HPP resulted in the release of vast volumes of fresh water contaminated with fertilisers, fuel, lubricants, and sewage into the Black Sea. Following the hydroelectric power plant explosion, this polluted river water reached the Danube’s mouth, affecting over 7,300 km2 of the sea area. Scientists have noted a rapid decrease in water salinity in the Gulf of Odesa. In some coastal zones, exceedingly high nitrogen levels were recorded, indicative of sewage pollution. This significant drop in salinity has caused the demise of various marine life, including mussel colonies, fry, and fish eggs, potentially disrupting the entire coastal ecosystem. The influx of polluted fresh water has also triggered extensive algae blooms, further impacting the sea’s health.

Unfortunately, the environmental impact of the infrastructure facilities destruction in the war is not a singular occurrence. Numerous Russian attacks along the Black Sea coastline have led to the devastation of sewage treatment plants and port infrastructures, resulting in unchecked pollution entering the sea. The monitoring group CEOBS has documented several instances of such pollution in the Dnipro-Buh estuary near Mykolaiv. Russian attacks have targeted key industrial sites on the estuary’s left bank, including the Mykolaiv Alumina Plant, where storage tanks for fuel, caustic soda, and recyclable materials were damaged. Additionally, grain terminals and a sunflower oil terminal were hit, leading to significant pollution of the estuary waters and the surrounding marine environment.

Additional pollution in the sea comes from submerged military equipment, ships, and ammunition, releasing chemical compounds, rocket fuel residues, and heavy metals into the water. Sunken ships and aircraft are also significant sources of oil pollution. Due to the presence of Russian mines, scientists’ access to the Black Sea is restricted, but satellite imagery provides vital data on oil and other pollutants.

Scientists estimate that oil slicks have covered tens of thousands of square kilometres of Ukraine’s marine protected areas. This oil layer impedes oxygen penetration into the water, inflicting immense damage on marine life and often leading to mass fatalities. Oil and lubricants are particularly toxic to aquatic life, especially the tiny organisms in plankton and neuston (organisms living near the water’s surface). Oil residues can linger on the sea surface for extended periods, drifting with currents, washing ashore, or sinking to the seabed, posing long-term ecological challenges.

# The impact of war on marine animals in Ukraine

The Russian army extensively mined Ukraine’s waters and vast territories, which poses another long-term ecological challenge. Mines not only contaminate the environment with explosives and heavy metals but also threaten marine life through accidental detonation. Underwater explosions can lead to massive fish kills and inflict mine-blast injuries on aquatic creatures. These events also negatively impact cetaceans in the Black Sea, including three species: bottlenose dolphins, white-sided dolphins, and common foccids (porpoises). All are listed in The Red Data Book of Ukraine and require special protection, a need that has become even more critical during the war. Additionally, submarine use of sonars (hydroacoustic stations) presents an extra risk to these marine mammals. The sonar interferes with dolphins’ echolocation abilities, essential for their navigation and communication.

Since February 2022, scientists have observed widespread cetacean fatalities across the Black Sea. In the year since the full-scale war began, about 1,000 dolphins have been found dead, a figure that is two to three times higher than in previous years. The actual number of casualties could be even greater. Notably, there has also been a significant increase in dolphins washing ashore while still alive.

To ascertain the precise cause of each animal’s death, scientists need to conduct tests and autopsies. These examinations will clarify whether the deceased dolphins experienced acoustic trauma or if their deaths were combat-related. During these autopsies, tissue, and organ samples are collected for further analysis. Currently, specialist scientists are conducting this work in collaboration with law enforcement agencies, as the Ukrainian Prosecutor’s Office has initiated a criminal investigation into the mass cetacean deaths and crime of ecocide.

100,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c9hmfz,Lost almost all of my fish and I’m not sure why,"My population has been stable for more than 6 months, even before I cleared up the dead Cyanobacteria got the mopani wood and plants. 8 celestial pearl danios (referred to as cpd later), 3 panda cories (I know not enough but I stopped buying them a long time ago because new ones always die), and 2 nerite snails. The tank has been established for a year. I know it’s overstocked but I attend to it frequently. 

Here’s a timeline:

Monday: In the morning there was a power outage but I don’t know how long because I was at work. I heard about it through friends. My light timer was reset so the lights in it were off when I got home. I turned the lights on and the water was cloudy. The lights are off schedule and not on as much as usual over this week because I couldn’t figure out how to change the timer. Tested it, ammonia 0ppm, nitrite 0ppm, nitrate 0ppm, did a water change anyway because it was due. 

Tuesday: I only count 6 cpd. Test the water and ammonia is 0.25, changed water again. Can’t find bodies but I didn’t take out the wood. I should have I know. Ammonia after water change 0 ppm

Wednesday: tested ammonia at 0ppm

Thursday: Too busy to attend to it or look.

Friday: 2 more missing fish when I counted. I tested ammonia at 1.0 ppm. Took out the wood, hunted bodies, found a cpd stuck in a crack in the wood and assumed that was the problem. Never found one of the bodies. Ammonia 0ppm after change. 

Saturday: Lost another 2 cpd. Tested ammonia 0ppm, removed the bodies. 0ppm everything. Late night found a dead panda cory (it’s worth noting I’ve had these 3 for nearly a year). Tested all nitrogen products and the result is photo 2. 0ppm everything. Messed with the light timer for a while and finally set it correctly.

Sunday: Found cpd body. 

I went from 8 cpds and 3 panda corys to 1 cpd and 2 panda corys in a week. 

I don’t even know what went wrong and why they keep dying. The only difference is the lights not being on as much as usual.",21 Apr 2024 09:14:54

##Armenia and Azerbaijan reach a preliminary agreement to delimit parts of the Tavush border

[Joint statement here.](https://en.armradio.am/2024/04/19/armenia-azerbaijan-agree-that-the-process-of-delimitation-will-be-based-on-1991-alma-ata-declaration/)

The map published by the press indicates that Armenia and Azerbaijan have reached a preliminary agreement to delimit the border stretching between Baghanis and Voskepar and that Azerbaijani forces will not cross into the Armenian highway in this section. 

Going further south, between Voskepar and Kirants, this second most talked-about area will be excluded from this delimitation phase and the Armenian forces will maintain control over the hilly curvy road. This is the area where the Armenian road crosses the border multiple times. After PM Pashinyan's recent meeting with local residents, one resident claimed that Pashinyan told them that they are negotiating with Azerbaijan to keep Azeri forces behind the river, which is in line with the map presented today. 

Going further south, the Azeri village Kheyremlu will protrude and cover part of the Armenian road passing near the Armenian village of Kirants. During the recent meeting with residents, Pashinyan informed residents that building a bypass road won't be a problem here. 

Going further down, the border will be delimited near Berkaber. The Azeri village on the other side of the border has already been under Azeri control for decades. 

**REPORTER:** The AM-AZ border commissions have released a joint statement about a preliminary agreement. What can you tell us about this?

**GOVERNMENT:** The commissions reproduced on the map the borders that existed during the period of the Soviet Union in this section, and in the next step, these borders should be clarified and expressed on the ground as well, and this will be an unprecedented event. For the first time, there will be a demarcated state border between our countries, in the section of the four villages.

**REPORTER:** What year of maps is this process based on?

**GOVERNMENT:** The most recent topographical maps with a legal base of the USSR period. The important detail is that according to the statement issued by the border Commissions, the borders that existed at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union have a legal basis and are being restored. It is also important to record that the Commissions agreed that in the entire process of border delimitation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, they will rely on the 1991 Alma Ata Declaration. This principle should also be recorded in the Regulation of the border delimitation process, which will be agreed upon between the parties in the coming months and will undergo the necessary internal processes, including the approval process in the parliament.

**REPORTER:** The issue of enclaves/exclaves is also mentioned in the joint statement of the Border Delimitation Commissions, what does that mean?
 
**GOVERNMENT:** The Commissions agreed that after the approval of the Regulation, they will agree on the order of delimitation of the remaining sections of the Armenia-Azerbaijan state border, and in this context, they will also address the issue of enclaves/exclaves. Armenia cannot renounce this issue, because Artsvashen is a part of the sovereign territory of our country. We are going to de jure substantiate the existence of the Artsvashen exclave/enclave in the delimitation process, and the government of the Republic of Armenia has such substantiations, after which the actual delimitation process around Artsvashen will be carried out. What kind of political solution will be given to the issue after being recorded is a different question. In the delimitation process, the existence of the exclave/enclaves must first be substantiated de jure.

**REPORTER:** After the border delimitation, the armed forces will withdraw in the area of the four villages and give way to the border guard troops. When will this happen?

**GOVERNMENT:** It should happen soon, without artificial delays.

**REPORTER:** As a result of this process, will any village in Armenia be deprived of roads?

**GOVERNMENT:** No. In the section of Kirants village, a few hundred meters section of the road outline will be changed, which is not something difficult and will be implemented in a few months. But this is not the only road for Kirants. The Kirants-Acharkut-Ijevan road will be repaired, maybe rebuilt as well. Kirants also has an alternative road, and practically there are no major problems.

**REPORTER:** And Voskepar won’t have road problems?

**GOVERNMENT:** No. At this stage, areas that have the potential to cause such a problem are not being delimited.

**REPORTER:** As a result of this border delimitation process, Azerbaijan will come close to the villages of Kirants and Voskepar in a number of areas. How will the security of these villages be ensured?

**GOVERNMENT:** Azerbaijan is already very close to those villages and they are under direct fire. Yes, as a result of this process, the border guard service of Azerbaijan will get closer, but their villages and ours will be separated by a delimited state border. This is a key factor and let's not forget that the border protection will be carried out by the border guards of the Republic of Armenia. In addition, there are many details of providing security, which will also be discussed and detailed in the near future.

##prominent members of the ruling party respond to the border delimitation agreement 

The opposition's stance on Tavush delimitation has been clear: it's capitulation and treason. Ranking members of the ruling party responded to the new agreement: 

**MP KHANDANYAN:** The border commissions have agreed to rely on the 1991 Almaty Declaration, which is recorded as a fundamental principle of the demarcation process. It should continue to be the main political condition in the further process of state border delimitation.

**MP KONJOYAN:** This is the first time we're going to have a demarcated section of the AM-AZ border. The clear recording of the border will become a decisive and legitimate factor aimed at protecting the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Armenia.

**MP ALEXANYAN:** Having a delimited and demarcated state border with Azerbaijan based on the Alma Ata Declaration can become the basis of long-term peace and stability for the region, and Armenia will continue to steadily move in this direction. Expect the known forces to receive a metodichka [from Russia] to launch a new whining campaign. 

**MP GRIGORYAN:** Azerbaijan was previously refusing to accept the 1991 declaration as the basis for this process. They were also previously refusing to rely on the de jure situation at the time of the collapse of the USSR, in other words, the most recent de jure topographical maps of USSR.

**SARGSYAN:** (1) Problems are being resolved not by the use of force, but by negotiations, professional commissions, and demarcation. (2) It relies on the 1991 Almaty Declaration, which is supported by Armenia, the EU, and the US, and opposed by Azerbaijan and Russia.

##interview with Pashinyan's chief of staff about the border delimitation 

**REPORTER:** What does this agreement mean?

**HARUTYUNAN:** This is an outcome of very hard work. If we are able to implement the agreement, we will have an unprecedented situation in AM-AZ relations. It creates a civilized platform where specific documents and agreements can allow us to clarify and reaffirm the AM-AZ state border. Negotiations are always better than aggression. Since there was a tension created by the media around these 4 villages, we decided to make an offer and choose this path, and the parties agreed. We have long insisted that the delimitation must be based on de jure documents so you can use the same thing to demarcate the entire AM-AZ border from north to south with the same logic. The basis of our agreement are the latest legal topographic maps that hold de jure power, that were created by Soviet authorities with relevant power. We have worked very long to use Almaty as the basis. We raised this during various formats and meetings. I'm very happy that it is fixed as the main principle. 

**REPORTER:** What about enclaves/exclaves?

**HARUTYUNAN:** As we've said before, Artsvashen is legally part of Armenia. We have documents proving that. Armenian government acknowledges that the Constitution and law require us not to ignore any territory belonging to Armenia, so the exclave topic is on the table. Similarly, if Azerbaijan claims it has exclaves controlled by Armenia then they must prove it by presenting de jure documents. 

**REPORTER:** The armed forces will retreat to give way to border guards. When?

**HARUTYUNAN:** Within a reasonable timeframe after the commissions and departments reach an agreement. We will first discuss various security issues concerning neighboring areas.  

**REPORTER:** Will the Armenian villages lose roads? 

**HARUTYUNAN:** There is a small section in the Kirants direction, a few hundred meters, which has an easy terrain and our experts can resolve that issue within several months. Additionally, we will repair or rebuild the existing secondary road in that section - the Kirants-Acharkut-Ijevan.
 
**REPORTER:** Will there be a problem in Voskepar road?

**HARUTYUNAN:** No. All the concerns that the residents of Voskepar raised during the meeting with Pashinyan have been heard, and that road is not part of the delimitation process at this phase. 

**REPORTER:** How will you organize the protection of nearby villages if the border gets closer?

**HARUTYUNAN:** The line of contact is already very close to their homes. These villages have been in the line of fire. The conversion of the line of contact into a state border will make it safer. Because of modern technologies, living hundreds of kilometers away without a stable border is more dangerous than living near a stable border. This topic is often manipulated by those who oppose the delimitation process.  

**REPORTER:** What does Armenia gain from this process?

**HARUTYUNAN:** Armenia gains (1) a stable border, (2) confirmation of the Almaty Declaration as the main principle, (3) a civilized platform for discussing and reaffirming the borders, (4) the basis for using jure documents that will allow us to demarcate the AM-AZ border from top to bottom, (5) Armenia stands on its legitimate territory by returning the 2.5 villages to Azerbaijan. 

**REPORTER:** The Friday agreement says parties agree to later continue to demarcate the rest of the border. So is this the beginning of a lengthy process? 

**HARUTYUNAN:** This is going to be a long and complex process. Armenia is committed to the peace agenda.

##Armenia offered its services as a potential facilitator between Israel and Palestine 

FM Mirzoyan visited Saudi Arabia earlier this week. ArabNews outlet interviewed him. 

**ARAB NEWS:** Mirzoyan expressed his support for a two-state solution and ceasefire in Palestine. In December last year, Armenia joined Saudi Arabia and more than 150 other countries in the UN General Assembly in voting for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. If necessary, and if asked, Mirzoyan said Armenia would be ready to act as a potential facilitator between the two sides.

**MIRZOYAN:** Armenia has always supported the two-state solution, and Armenia is strongly against the violence and targeting civilian populations. Armenia had very recently been on the receiving end of such violence. So we are strongly against violence against civilian populations.

**ARAB NEWS:** Armenia’s commitment to helping war-affected civilian populations has gone beyond mere words and condemnation. Last month it sent 30 tonnes of food and medicine to displaced Palestinian civilians sheltering in Rafah. Armenia regretted seeing tens of thousands of innocent victims of the escalation of hostilities in Gaza, said Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan at a press briefing during a visit to Egypt to discuss aid deliveries. Armenia is embarking on diplomatic ties with several nations and multilateral bodies, including the EU, as it shifts away from its historically strongest ally, Russia.

**FM MIRZOYAN:** The people of Armenia have European aspirations and it is becoming more and more strong on the background of the frustration that Armenian people had in terms of Armenian-Russian relations, but not limited to that. Armenia is really deepening, significantly deepening, its relations with the US, with the EU. They are our main partners in our democratic reform agenda. Now they show a strong willingness to support Armenia, to strengthen Armenia’s economic resilience. We are starting with the EU a new path of close partnership and, so far, none can say for sure where this path will lead the two sides.

##we still consider Armenia as an ally: Kremlin 

**LAVROV:** We are still allies, and not just on paper, because there are still those in Armenia who understand the importance of Russia for the defense and economic development of Armenia, and this includes Pashinyan who recently gave a [speech at Parliament](https://youtu.be/fUNm5JqQwGM) and emphasized the importance of AM-RU relations. I hope he will soon meet Putin and hold an honest discussion.

##Kremlin confirms the recent ""leak"" by a ranking CSTO official: CSTO and Russia do not recognize Armenia's territories and therefore cannot protect it 

Armenia requested military-political assistance from CSTO and Russia after the Azerbaijani army encroached several kilometers into Armenian territories and stood near the outskirts of the town of Jermuk in 2022. They encroached far beyond the immediate line of contact, beyond the ""small hills and bushes"" that could be argued as ""disputed"" by some. 

Western states immediately recognized it as a clear violation of Armenia's territorial integrity and demanded the withdrawal of Azerbaijani forces. 

An anonymous ranking CSTO official recently made it clear that CSTO didn't help Armenia because Azerbaijan considers those territories disputed and as long as Armenia and Azerbaijan do not agree around their borders and resolve it themselves, the CSTO won't help Armenia. 

Russia's foreign minister Lavrov essentially repeated the CSTO official's statement on Friday: ""երբ ասում են, որ ՀԱՊԿ-ը չի կարողանում որոշել, թե որտեղ է գտնվում իր պատասխանատվության գոտին Հայաստանում, Հայաստանն ինքը դեռ չի որոշել:""

Մոսկվան պնդում է՝ Երևանը ինքը չի կարողանում որոշել ՀԱՊԿ պատասխանատվության գոտին ՀՀ տարածքում:

##... Pashinyan's chief of staff responds to FM Sergey Lavrov 

**ARAYIK HARUTYUNYAN:** That is illogical and we regret to hear this. Under that logic, if Japan attacks Russia in the area where they have not demarcated their borders, and the Japanese army reaches all the way to Vladivostok just as Azerbaijan did to Jermuk, and if Russia requests dear CSTO for help, should we tell Mr. Lavrov to go clarify his borders with Japan? It's regrettable that this unacceptable falsehood is used by official Russian figures. This is unacceptable for us. Some of our ""analysts"" began to repeat this falsehood; stop this anti-Armenian propaganda.

##Nagorno-Karabakh's pro-Russian parliamentary parties express concern about the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers 

**PARTIES:** The process of the withdrawal of the Russian peacekeeping troops from the territory of the occupied Artsakh Republic is very concerning for the 150,000 Artsakh citizens who were displaced from their homeland months ago under the real threat of genocide.  

For the legitimate authorities elected by the people of the Republic of Artsakh and factions of the parliament, the issue of dignified return has been and continues to be a priority, and the guarantee of our fundamental rights and security is of cornerstone importance.

The people of Artsakh became trapped by the provisions of the November 9 declaration and believed in the assurances of the Russian top leadership to ensure its security. We are forced to record with pain and regret that the fate of the people of Artsakh became a secondary issue for all the parties that signed the Nov. 9 agreement, due to which Artsakh was completely depopulated in September 2023. //

The parties want the Russian government to launch a dialogue with them ASAP to discuss the reasons for withdrawal.

Yerevan municipality dispatched inspectors to remove food sold illegally under open air [on the sidewalks](https://youtu.be/l2fl3gMnyGI) of central districts of Yerevan. The sidewalk sellers were informed earlier that it was necessary to move to a designated area. Not everyone was happy.

**SELLER:** Shame. I spit on the government's face. I have two sons protecting the border. I dare you to write me a citation. Try it if you're a man.

**REPORTER:** But we saw flies sitting all over the fish you're selling on the sidewalk.

**SELLER:** I'm a veteran. Shame on you. I spit on Nikol's face. Go fine actual criminals. Sasun Mikaelyan is my friend. Do you want me to call him?

**INSPECTOR:** Come on, father. Sasun Mikaelyan would tell you not to break the law. 

**SELLER:** Whaaaaaat? You better go after the talanchi instead.

**INSPECTOR (to reporters):** We patrol every day and urge them to stop but there are some who violate the law regularly. The people you saw today were warned 100-150 times and had their stuff confiscated 10-15 times already. You saw how they sold fish in the open air on a sidewalk under everyone's feet. Their excuse is that they have to do this to make a living, but we have offered them employment with high wages in the city departments; we are hiring. If they don't want to work for the city, they can sell their products in one of the 26 legal markets in the city. Why should they be more privileged than law-abiding sellers? We don't enjoy doing this forcefully but our warnings were ignored.

##for the first time in one billion years, two lifeforms were caught merging into one organism: scientists

This rare event occurred between a marine algae and a bacterium in a lab. For perspective, last time this happened, the Earth got plants.

Primary endosymbiosis happens when one microbial organism engulfs another. It then begins to use the swallowed organism as an internal organ. 

The host provides it with nutrients, energy, and protection. When the swallowed microorganism can no longer survive on its own, it becomes an organ for the host. 

This endosymbiosis has only happened three known times. All of these instances were a major breakthroughs for evolution.

##... the first event 

It was 2.2 billion years ago. A single-celled organism swallowed up a bacterium and eventually became the mitochondria. Its formation allowed for complex organisms to evolve. 

##... the second event 

About 1.6 billion years ago, more advanced cells absorbed cyanobacteria. One thing led to another, and it gained sunlight-harvesting abilities and led to the birth of plants.

##... the third event

With this latest endosymbiosis event, it’s possible that the algae is converting nitrogen from the atmosphere into ammonia that it can use for other cellular processes, and it needs the help of the bacterium.

103,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1c7zr3s/climate_change_isnt_actually_bad_or_good/,Climate change isn't actually bad (or good),"During the Late Devonian plants colonized the land and sequestered a ton of CO2, which meant extreme, fast cooling, and the extinction of 76% of species. Even earlier than that, the cyanobacteria potosynthesizing filled the atmosphere with oxygen which killed off most species. And I don't think anyone in their right mind is saying that plants and cyanobacteria are demonic species that hurt the planet and all the other human-hating bullshit we are fed today. I think climate change is a propaganda tool to virtue signal against people by the rich and to distract people from rising inequality. Christianity was also used by the rich to tell regular people they were ""sinners and evil and deserved punishment and were going to hell unless they did as they were told"". ""Climate change"" is just the new bullshit. We are just a massively succesful species, and historically that means climate change and mass extinction. Nothing inherently wrong with that.

  
EDIT: To everyone saying ""oh you are just selfish you think it's indifferent because it won't affect you"", you are completely misinterpreting my argument. The point was more along the lines of the fact that since climate change and its prevention has become one of the main political talking points, it displaces more important issues, namely inequality (which, as one commenter pointed out, underlies climate change). It also makes it easy for rich people to virtue signal and say ""oh no we are very good because we are now investing in this shiny bullshit to prevent climate change. Please nevermind the private jets or military operations or Mr Epstein's private island. The evil ones are those pesky Chinese burning coal.""

104,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c7nkfv,Update and more questions,"Hi everyone,
Two months ago I posted asking for help with Walter, my office's fish and I got some great suggestions and I followed them to a T. We had a successful fish-in cycle that lasted 6 weeks and it's now been 3 weeks of stable water parameters. Ammonia:0ppm, Nitrite: 0ppm and Nitrate: < 10ppm.
I want to slowly start introducing live plants to his tank and get rid of the fake ones, however. I have noticed a growth of dark green algae (which I think might be cyanobacteria). I read that it can be treated with Erythromycin. So I was wondering if it would be safe for me to treat the tank with API E.M. Erythromycin before I introduce any plants?

Other info: Walter seems to be doing better, co-workers tell me he gets excited about food again. However, he spends most of his time at the bottom of his tank, on top of the filter or hiding in a rock hide. I also feel like there hasn't been much improvement on his color and fins.",19 Apr 2024 00:02:09

After the water cleared, I added in my first real plants. 2 anubias nanas, and a patch of dwarf grass. (Then I impulse bought a piece of drift wood w/mystery moss and a moss ball w/Java fern)

After the tank cleared up (again) I put in some plant food and quick start to get things moving. After being stuck at 1ppm ammonia for a few days, I added more beneficial bacteria. Which may have also caused my cyanobacteria and algae bloom which I'm still currently handling :/ I put in my first dose of blue green algae surface stain remover (April 18) and I'm hoping what is said about it is true... What stinks is this outbreak is happening just as my dwarf grass began to grow rapidly (last pic shows start of grass growth).

108,https://i.redd.it/hbs8on4wwkuc1.jpeg,Has anyone visited Grand Prismatic Springs at Yellowstone? ,"Unlike the water at Cotorra Springs the water in these aquifers is hot enough to boil the meat off your bones, as a few visitors unfortunately find out from time to time, if they're not gored by bison first. These waters are heated by the potentially violent and devastatingly eruptive Yellowstone magma hotspot below, a region of the Earth's crust that is being melted by the underlying mantle.

Nevertheless rich ecosystems of microrganisms have evolved to live along the gradient of high temperatures within the geyser water and springs and are responsible for the deep zones of coloration. These thermophilic microbes, many of which are photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria and Archaea are also differentialy adapted to the pH gradients that are present. Essentially the coloration is due to pigments in the microbes that selectively absorb and/or reflect different wavelengths of light. This protects the cells from the intense sunlight. 

Finally because of Covid most people are familiar with the PCR test, which had already revolutionized biotechnology and medical research long before 2019. These microorganisms, however, revolutionized the PCR procedure. PCR imitates the copying of DNA that goes on when cells replicate and divide, but rather than using enzymes to pull apart the double stranded DNA, a PCR device uses heat to break hydrogen bonds and separate DNA strands, much like heat separates the molecules in a pan of water when you boil it. Unfortunately the heat also takes its toll on the enzymes used to copy DNA. It literally cooks them. Early on someone realized that they could  use the DNA copying enzymes purified from these microbes and it would mean not having to replenish by adding fresh enzyme after each hot cycle in the PCR program.

116,https://i.redd.it/4o0r7ui38xsc1.jpeg,Alternate History/Timeline; a Clockwise Spinning Earth,"Context;

This is the premise of an alternate history or evolution project, centering around the idea of a world where the Earth spins clockwise, or “backward”, something that is known as retrograde rotation, similar to Venus. This doesn’t focus on what caused this to happen, but it instead focuses on geographical changes related to climate and weather changes between the two timelines, some similar and some dramatically different to our timeline. How the plants and animals of this world would adapt to all the changes.

Me and Molotovsnowman have gone through yet more scrutiny with regards to our previous data, especially by using the videos from the 2018 study data to measure using better software such as paint.net and climate simulation software so that we can more accurately measure the climate of this world. If a more up to date and powerful study looks at this premise with higher resolution, this will likely become obsolete, as the squares the studies use are quite big and make averages.

Using this more precise measuring, we’ve modified some of the temperate and humidity values of certain places, particularly with regard to precipitation patterns and seasonal variations, showing exactly how these places vary between seasons. As a result this helps us come to think about what would be living in these places. In future we will do an updated biome map that covers exactly what kind of ecosystems would be prevalent on such a world.

Molotov did some dats analysison the rainfall pattern of this timeline, determining not only the overall rainfall of certain places, but also what times of the year in which they fall significantly in, as can be seen the rainfall gif near the end of the slideshow, showing areas of intense rainfall in each month of the year.

Before this is a graph showing some of the wettest places in this timeline. Some of these are very wet year round, such as Ascension Island and coastal southwest Africa as a whole, or the Indus Valley, now a subtropical rainforest akin to a wetter southern China. Others are more monsoonal with pronounced dry seasons, which as the dry forests of the former Sahel and Arabia, now akin to our India or Southeast Asia. The flora and fauna of these lands would undoubtedly be a mix of subsaharan, Indian and even European migrants.

Just because a place doesn’t register on the humidity gif doesn’t mean there is no rain in this seasons, it means that it is not a significant or ‘monsoonal’ quantity, with the picture before it showing places that received a lot of rain.

Hawaii is an interesting example; at first it appears only slightly warmer and wetter on average than in our timeline, but in practise, it has gone from a rare dry summer savannah variant (As in the Koppen-Geiger system) to a more typical dry winter variant (Aw), with resulting changes in flora happening as a result. 
Similarly, the Iberian peninsula maintains rainfall from the Mediterranean monsoon, while also getting an Atlantic rain during winter, keeping it notably more humid than in our timeline. However, the harsh winters of Europe (keep in mind the temperature gif is skewed somewhat by elevation averages) mean that continental climates are far more prevalent. Other changed islands are a much drier and somewhat cooler Madagascar, Taiwan and Mauritius, a far wetter Galapagos and Socotra, a wetter and monsoonal Cyprus, and a strangely oceanic Mediterranean Japan, including southern Sakhalin. Other tropical islands like Indonesia haven’t changed too much, a result of low latitude.

My own gif creation involves a demonstration of how temperatures have altered in their distribution in this timeline. As can be seen by my monthly averages graph, winter temperatures in Europe and British Columbia are much harsher than in our timeline, but the reverse is true for the eastern coasts of America and Asia. An interesting fluke is the Mediterranean Sea, which helps moderate the hardness of Europe and North Africa, allowing much of that region to have relatively mild winters. Similarly, surrounded by oceans, the now monsoonal Arabia doesn’t vary as much as our India in temperatures, with only some of the southern regions averaging above 27C and only for a short time, while even Syria, Cycilia and Kurdistan remain above 2C in January.

Western Europe is a far cry from ours, with parts of northern Britain remaining below 2C until June, while the Italian peninsula is mostly very seasonal, akin to our Korea or New England roughly. Eastern Europe is even colder and harsher, with all of Europe north of the Seine being taiga forest. Tundras stretch down into Norway, while temperate forests cling on in southern Europe and Crimea. The cool and dry Caucasus remains a steppe, as does a cooler Central Asia, akin to pre-Reversal Mongolia. 

Australia has certainly changed too; a cooler and much wetter west and warmer east is present; the desert is still present, but is now focussed in the east and has shrunk considerably to the benefit of the savannahs of the north and subtropical woodlands of the west. The continent now resembles how it did during the early Pliocene, and like it sees a resurgence in declining groups. This region would definitely be more capable of higher population in this timeline.

South America has dramatically changed in some places. The Amazon still exists, but is smaller and less dense than before, more like our Congo, while the savannahs have shifted northward. North Brazil is now dominated by the world’s largest desert, akin to the Outback, though the La Plata river offers a lifeline through this, ideal ground for urban societies to develop. The same is true for the Orinoco in Venezuela, now akin to our Indus. The western coast on the other hand is much wetter, the Galapagos and Atacama now being rainforest and coastal Peru’s deserts are now savannah. Valvidia is colder and drier, while Patagonia has become temperate forest. 

As before, the Sahara is mild and wet, but it wasn’t clear until now how mild it is, with even the Maghreb (part from the highlands) being around 7C or above in winter and only slightly above 22C in summer, and year round humidity making akin to the southeastern USA of our timeline. The drier Egypt region is nearer 14C in January, allowing easy plant growth if one is ok with the winter dry season. Further south, the former Sahel has mostly changed into an intensely monsoonal region, akin to India or Indochina but in an even larger scale, with lake Chad not being too dissimilar to our Thailand climatically. Only the western Sahel is relatively similar. A vast savannah larger than all those south of the Sahara combined exists in these regions, allowing easy flow of African animals northward and beyond. The Great Lakes region is slightly wetter than before, but the Horn is an outright rainforest, while the southeast and Madagascar are much drier and more hostile now. Rainforests stretch down the coast all the way down to Angola and even Namibia. The Congo has now supplanted the Amazon as the world’s largest rainforest, and deserves a new name to boot; the Azanian. This has now taken the savannah’s place as the main division between Africa. 

Don’t take these temperatures too perfectly, however, as they do seem to(based on the prograde simulations in the same study) to exaggerate the extreme summers of hot desert climates in a way not seen elsewhere in the study data, as well as possibly continentality. It underestimates winter temperatures in prograde British Columbia while overestimating those of northern Japan for example. This is why Molotov simulated only coastal Iberia to be temperate rather than continental. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of southern Europe is still fairly mild despite the vast changes. Also keep in mind these assume preindustrial co2 levels and climate, with this world on average being 1.24C cooler globally than ours currently is.

Some of the most extreme temperature swings are present in Central Asia, home to summers almost as harsh as in our timeline, but considerably stronger winters, akin to the Midwest, creating ideal environments for tornados. Even more extreme is Northern European Russia, with summers only being above 2C on average for a meagre 3-4 months of the year, followed by bitter winters, akin to our Yakutia. Even the Caucasus and Anatolia are cold and continental, with only coastal Anatolia being still warm and mild, allowing a pathway for fleeing European flora and fauna to migrate to the Middle East.

Meanwhile, the Asian far east has become much milder than before, at least in the north; not to the extent of our Europe but still a vast improvement. Southern Manchuria and North Korea reach or surpass 22C for 3 months (compared to 2 in otl) and all 12 months average above 2C (compared to 3 averaging below 0C in otl). This along with flat land and a decent Mediterranean rainfall pattern of sunny dry summers and mild rainy winters makes this good land for early civilisation to form, as is the Yellow River basin to the south. Manchuria both inner and outer quickly becomes more continental as you go further inland, just as with our timeline (something the squares of the study videos do tend to skew a bit), but even parts of outer Manchuria are now temperate, while the bits that are still continental are now relatively mild and easy to handle for creatures, similar to Eastern Europe. Deciduous woodlands now grow as far as and even beyond (at least near the coasts) the Stanavoys. Even Mongolia is relatively milder than our own; slightly wetter and with weaker winters than before, its mountains providing refuge from the blistering heat of the south. The Yellow Sea is like a much smaller Mediterranean here, and like it has a great desert to the south, though not nearly as big or harsh as our Sahara, harbouring a Sahelian Indochina to the south. Indonesia is relatively drier than before, especially Sumatra but remains very humid and forested despite minor changes. Japan’s islands are very oceanic, with only the southwest having hot summers, while all of the islands, including not only Hokkaido, but the Kurils and the southern half of Sakhalin having mild winters that allow easy plant and crop growth. Even southern kamchatka now has an oceanic climate, akin to British Columbia or Ireland. 

The Indian subcontinent apart from the aforementioned rainforests of the northwest, hasn’t changed too much at all in the north, but the south and Sri Lanka are substantially wetter as seen in the study data, now being one of the wettest places on earth, a large rainforest. In addition, sea nitration occurs on a level unheard of in our timeline here, leading to unprecedented Cyanobacteria blooms off the coast. 

The west coast of North America now has one of the world’s largest monsoons affecting it, though not quite as large and intense as the East Asian monsoon of our timeline. Only California still recieves decent rain during the winters now, a very stark contrast. Southern Cascadia, with a strong continental shift, resembles a milder Manchuria now, and Columbia is akin to the Russian far east, harsh and hostile to outsiders, though a warmer and milder Aleutians catches the brunt of the Mid-Pacific current, being relatively nice to dwell in. California and the southwest resemble an even more mountainous southern China in miniature form, and Baja takes Florida’s place. Animals of southern and western Mexico now roam around California without issues, as well as refugees from the desertified southeast. The Midwest and Great Lakes is a wild place of hot and dry summers and freezing winters, similar to our Central Asia, while the midatlantic and New England are Mediterranean. Even Nova Scotia and Newfoundland are now temperate, and coastal Labrador and the Hudson Bay coastline are little bit milder than in our timeline, the opposite of their west coast counterparts.

120,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ecosphere/comments/1bu3x2z/eternal_algae_ecosphere_elder/,eternal algae ecosphere (elder),"hello, some of you have already seen that I made a post about my oldest aquatic ecosphere, and in one of the photos, there is an ecosystem with yellowish water and a lot of soil, and that's what I'm going to talk about, in case you haven't seen the other one post I will put the link in the comments, ok :)

This pot was assembled on December 30, 2021 (2 years and 3 months), together with another pot (the smallest pot of the 3). When setting up, I added a lot of water and a leaf that was outside the lake where I got it, just to see what happened.

I can describe this ecosphere as: ""a pump of nutrients that are in constant recycling and with countless algae and other beings taking advantage of this high dose of nutrients to thrive. Worms and ostracoda come out of the soil/hiding places in warm periods and graze or eat any organic debris and algae that they find. Colonies and biofilms of bacteria inhabit the soil and the airy part of the ecosystem (?), caves that previously existed are buried by debris, with only 1 large cave in the back. plains and mesas are formed in the ecosystem, in addition to 2 distinct biomes above ground"".

Since its beginning, its water has always been cloudy, and all beings that were not copepods, worms, ostracods, died quickly. Due to the enormous amount of algae and nutrients, copepods/cyclopods and ostracods lived in peace and harmony for a long time. The water in these biospheres became clear twice, and on both occasions, it was possible to see the mountain that was forming in the front of the pot and the countless worms that inhabited that environment, along with the leaf. The atmosphere was dynamic and beautiful.....even a cold week.

In the same week that there was a kick-off for the great extinction in the ""peaceful pastures"" pot, the ""eternal algae ecosphere"" also went through the extinction process, only surprisingly, the ecosphere suffered practically no serious damage, like its companion , there was only the extinction of copepods and one species of ostracoda.

Currently, the pot is healthy and has a huge population of ostracoda and worms, which dig into the new soil that was created from the remains of the decomposition of organic matter, the leaf, was buried by the detritus and must now be completely decomposed. The ostracods swim and hit the algal mist that has created at the back of the pot, and the colonies of bacteria and algae that have formed beneath the soil are stable and have apparently created an ""ecosystem"", along with the biofilm. and the algae colony that is above the water level. In front of the pot, a large film of cyanobacteria is growing and creating a biome of its own.

This pot is the youngest of the ancients and is the most mysterious, a cool fact is that when I went to take the photos, I noticed that the water in the pot is clearer than in summer (here in Brazil it is autumn, we changed seasons recently) , then the pot may have clear water soon.

Black algae in pools is the species of algae that mainly develops in both indoor and outdoor swimming pools due to the appropriate temperature and humidity. ""Cyanobacteria,"" scientifically known, shows a dark black or blue-green rash on the surface of a pool, especially walls and crevices. Attaching deeply to the pool's surfaces, black algae can become a nuisance as they grow up towards the water. This condition explains their ability to live in chlorinated water and withstand brushing. It usually grows best in areas with poor circulation, low sunlight, and very low chlorine concentrations.

And I wanted to show you the history and what the ecosphere is like today. Just letting you know that the story will be about the things I remember, so we'll have some time holes, showing only the important things. Having made all that clear, let's move on to the story.

It was created on November 28, 2021, in a pot that wasn't airtight (hence the bunch of ribbons and little water), it's still a plant that I thought was aquatic. At the beginning (decantation and first months), it was on a sill in my window, receiving direct sunlight - only for a short time - then I noticed the larvae that lived there and even a flatworm (it died without leaving any descendants).

After decanting and staying on my balcony (where it is today) it contained A LOT of life, in a way that seemed to already have an ecosystem...... until that winter.....

In a cold week, somehow, all the filamentous algae died and this must have acidified the water (?) and killed a large part of the beings (from copepods to worms and some ostracoda and what was left of larvae), this devastated it to a point where a lump of dead algae that formed in the center did not decompose and remained in the jar for almost 1 YEAR. What was left was just mites and worms that died quickly. Today, a mat of cyanobacteria formed and some ostracoda eggs hatched, causing the species to thrive to this day.

Today, we have a stable ecosystem with euglenas (I forgot to mention them), a species of ostracoda (in Brazil - where I live - they are more resistant than copepods), a species of mite and 3 species of algae (which I identified). Besides a little orange ball that I don't know what it is.

Anyway, this is the ecosphere that I like to call ""peaceful pasture"", an ecosphere with a history that is far from calm and with some changes of destiny. It's a long post, but I wanted to share the story of this pot with someone and this subreddit is perfect. Anyway, thanks for reading and until next time, in the meantime, photos of the peaceful pasture :)

127,https://www.reddit.com/r/terraforming/comments/1brwxe5/creating_a_permanent_atmosphere_on_the_moon_from/,Creating a permanent atmosphere on the Moon from lunar industrialization,"I believe it is possible to terraform the Moon, or at least make the Moon far more habitable than it currently is.

One of the biggest problems with terraforming the Moon is that it does not have enough gravity to hold onto a breathable atmosphere for more than a few hundred years. However, some gases, such as xenon, are able to stay gravitationally bound to the moon. These gases could potentially last for millions of years, as the only force acting to remove them is solar wind.

Lighter gases are accelerated faster than heavier ones, and reach planetary escape velocities easier. This is why Earth doesn't have a hydrogen or helium atmosphere.

Molecules with higher molarity tend to move at lower speeds. Therefore, in the Moon's case, any gas with a molar mass greater than xenon will be gravitationally bound to the Moon. Luckily, there are hundreds of gases that are heavier than xenon, and can be mass-produced by manufacturing processes

The idea is once we colonize the moon and set up manufacturing hubs for mining helium-3 and taking advantage of making things in low-gravity, we emit tons of gaseous byproducts, mostly CO2 and methane, but also trace amounts of heavier molecules, which stay on the Moon and accumulate over time.

Then maybe after a few thousand years, the moon has enough heavy gases accumulated in it's atmosphere that the moon has a sky, liquid water can exist on the surface, and you can walk on the Moon without a spacesuit and just a hazmat suit.

There are several benefits to having an atmosphere on the moon, even if it is not breathable.

- Lunar dust loses it's static electricity

- Regolith can become clumpier and easier to use

- Protection from micrometeorites

- Protection from extreme day/night temperature changes

- Extra protection from cosmic radiation

- Moon bases won't explode if seriously ruptured

We could potentially even genetically engineer extremophilic cyanobacteria to metabolize the chemicals in the air and water to produce food or even small amounts of breathable air.",30 Mar 2024 20:24:45

130,https://i.redd.it/lh0vzdm0n4rc1.png,I'm on earliest stages of building my world. And I need several thoughts,"Hi there! You may think that this is an image of ancient eldritch horror but, actually, it is a map. Well, a sketch of a map of my fantasy world (part of it). But if your eyes start bleeding after you see this image - I think it's a compliment for me! Ok. So, white is ground, black is water. For context - this sketch was prepared for Wonderdraft, so this is a reason for such an interesting choice of color.

Oh, and I should say that I already made a post with this map more than a year ago, but I was lazy enough all that time to make nothing with it. Plus my doubts. Plus overthinking. Plus bad ideas that I couldn't reject for quite  a long time.. Though, I decided to return to that project and make something already.

Well, the main reason why I’m making this post is because I want to know if my ideas are interesting enough for people. And I have some ideas that I think are questionable.  I need someone's clear sight. So, all this long text is quite a boring bunch of facts about Akuma - my fantasy world. First of all - Akuma means ""evil spirit"" or ""devil"" in japanese. I suggest, this is the perfect name for this planet.

This planet is the third moon of a brown dwarf, and I can call it ""moon"" because the brown dwarf itself orbits a red dwarf star making this star system binary. There are three planets between red dwarf (RD) and brown dwarf (BD). RD is slightly heavier than half of the sun. BD has a mass of 54 Jupiters. All three planets between them are lighter than Earth. 

BD has six moons (or planets if you want). 5 of them are lighter than Earth, third is Akuma and 6 is, interestingly - a gas giant with moon. I made a model of this system in Universe Sandbox so it seems quite realistic despite being quite unlikely.

Well, I don't know of any real star system similar to it - no brown dwarf was found in such a strange configuration with a red dwarf. But I make it with purpose (!!!). Like, I want my fantasy world to be ""dark and spooky"" but I want it to be scientifically possible and still good enough for highly developed forms of life. Though most of its people evolved here good enough to live with all its ""spookiness'' without any problem. (Dark lighting from the planet's stars isn't the biggest problem). Forgot to say that Akuma has a mass of 77% of Earth.

So Akuma's environment is affected by both RD and BD. Needless to say that Akuma is tidally locked. And I work with half of the planet that can't see BD. So people here don't even know that they live on ""moon-like object"". Akuma's orbital period is 26 hours. The orbital period of BD around RD is 217 earthly days. 

While modeling in Universe Sandbox I make sure that Akuma's temperature is good enough for life, though in this model BD had an orbital period of 183 days. Well, it's slightly more than half of our year so I thought it was kinda boring. So I assumed that the effects of BD can expand the habitable zone for Akuma so I make BD's orbital period longer - 217 days. So Akuma's year is still lesser than Venus' year but its day is two hours longer than ours. 201 local days.

RD makes the sky on this planet reddish. And people here can see the brightest stars even during daytime. Scientists say that stars here might appear blue, but, well, if you were born in a red dwarf system and all your ancestors too, I suppose you wouldn't be able to see blue, green, and purple, and maybe all colors that are higher on the spectrum than orange and, maybe, yellow. You won't even know what it is.. It definitely creates some problems for my future writing…

Because of the red light, plants on Akuma are red or black. Plants' color depends on the environment and height, so some plants here are really brighty red and some are blacker than my soul. Like, plants in the mountains are red, because they need more protection from sunlight while plants in the lowest part of forest are quite black because for them catching sunlight is definitely uneasy. Well, I assume, there are no other specific effects of RD on the Akuma surface.

The impact of BD is interesting too. Every fucking day Akuma fluctuates. Because of BD's gravitation. You know, planets' orbits are not exactly round, so they have some part where they are closer to their parent object and part where it's farther. So to be short: every 26 hours of Akuma's day/night cycle (its orbital period) gravitation of BD stretches and squeezes it. Well, there is quite a big chance that in reality such a planet becomes hellish as Venus or Io...  

So BD's gravitation creates a lot of inner heat under Akuma's crust and this makes it warmer but consequence of it is quite wild tectonic activity. Volcanoes everywhere!!! And volcanic winters... sometimes. Earthquakes here and there... Such kind of stuff. Well, if you wondering why shape of continents on my map is such... strange, it is because of fucking BD's gravitation that plays with Akuma as dog with a ball. Plus I assume that gravitation of the nearest to Akuma planets have its effects too. And that creates unpredictable tides. Well...

Besides, BD has an electromagnetic field (EMF), and, considering the mass of BD I suggest that it's massive and powerful as fuck. Akuma is big enough to have its own EMF, and I suggest that interaction of two EMFs creates interesting effects. I just hope that they are not deadly for the planet's life and most importantly - intelligent life.

Well. BDs EMF protects Akuma from dangerous cosmic stuff and first of all - RD's solar storms. And aurora borealis everywhere!!! Sick waves of light across the skies almost everyday! I don't know if there can be some pattern of aurora's appearance so I just assume it's an unpredictable phenomenon. I think it's possible to see other similar phenomena here. I mean, phenomena with electromagnetic and/or electric nature. Ball lightning for example, sprites and so on. And that stuff is really frequent here. 

Because of the powerful presence of EMF it's quite hard to establish a high technological civilization on Akuma. Well, tbh it's impossible. Electromagnetic storms and stuff. It could look pretty in the skies but, you know, EMF kills all electronics here. I have plot trope with aliens that come to this planet long time ago and got fucked up by it. 

I suppose that local plant and animal life found some ways to use EMF for themselves. Like, for example, predators that can find prey by electric signals, or plants or mushrooms that use electromagnetic induction for its benefit.

Oh. I need to say that because of BD's EMF Akuma's polar regions are terrible for living. U know - it's like life in Chornobyl zone but worse. Polar regions are much more affected by EMF than others, so not many things can live here.

I suppose that the temperature of BD has some effect on Akuma too but, considering the nature of those objects and its evolution, I suggest, it's not so big. But, who knows? It's still quite a big relatively warm object, not an actual star though, but, well, it makes Akuma warmer than it could be.

And I have more!

Another distinctive feature of Akuma are its mushrooms. Giant mushrooms, actually. Well, I just slightly OBSESSED(!!!) with mushrooms so Akuma has different forms and types of them. 

I suppose I can justify its size by the environmental conditions of Akuma. You know, all those volcanoes release a lot of carbon material. CO2 at least. Mushrooms store it in their mycelium. Plus, well, maybe some of them have symbiotic relationships with some bacteria/cyanobacteria and/or lichen. And maybe volcanic emissions can be used by mushrooms quite well as ""food"". 

Mushrooms here create quite a wide and deep web of mycelium. I mean, this network may be stretching under the entire surface of the planet. This network is one of the main reasons why life is possible here despite all those shit as fucking volcanos with toxic gases and high as fuck greenhouse effect. I need to say that even in the earliest stages of worldbuilding when I didn't really know what kind of world I was trying to create, I had this idea of some ""World Tree"", though, ""dark"" variant of it. So this mycelium network is Akuma's ""World Tree"", Yggdrasil-like entity, though it is mushroom and it's mostly horizontal, plus kinda growing down - to the depths.

And now I go to the most problematic element of this world - this element is the main reason for my doubts and unproductive overthinking. Climate system of Akuma.

You know, our climate depends mostly on Earth's axis, so seasons exist because the axis is changing its incline through the year. Because of the short orbital period and strong gravitation of BD, the axial tilt of Akuma is 0. Maybe I should change the axial tilt of BD so it can change the orbital incline of all its satellites? Well, no. The orbital period of BD is shorter than Earth's, and its orbit is round almost perfectly because of it. I mean - seasonal changes on Akuma could still be quite unrecognizable even if BD has a bigger axial tilt. Plus - the big axial tilt of BD and its ""moons"" makes the whole system really unstable so everything just flies in different directions after several dozen years. 

Did I say I made modeling in Universe Sandbox?

So, our more ""traditional"" climate system doesn't work here on Akuma. I mean, in normal realistic conditions Akuma's climate is quite unchangeable, without seasons. Well, sometimes volcanic winter/s happens. Though it's unpredictable. And it's sooo boring!!! Fucking eternal summer!!! But I, seemingly, found a way!

Let's go back to the mushrooms! And to the volcanos! So, as it was said before, gravitation of BD makes Akuma fluctuate as accordion (?), because its orbit isn't perfectly round. That's create a lot of inner heat and more tectonic activity, volcanos and stuff. In turn that creates a greenhouse effect and fills the planet's atmosphere with a lot of CO2, methane and different toxic shit. 

And here mushrooms come into play! I mean - those fucking giant network of mycelium under Akuma's surface and ""normal"" mushrooms too absorb those gases, well, by using symbiotic organisms (bacteria, algae or lichen) or maybe by direct interaction of mycelium with plant roots... I don't know exactly how... 

This mycelium network protects the planet's lifeforms from dangerous greenhouse effect, stabilizes temperature and humidity and, possibly, recycles toxic elements of volcanic activity into something useful. And, moreover, mushroom-mycelium network creates seasonal changes. Somehow. And for some reason. 

I mean, this network has lifecycles that make its absorption (?) capacity sometimes worse and sometimes better so there is part of a year when greenhouse effect affects planet more and other part when it's not so bad. Well, mycelium lifecycles creates seasonal changes on Akuma. But I suppose this change is still not as drastic as Earth's so it looks like tropical seasons with small transition periods in-between. Ok. 

I hope all those bullshit is understandable enough. Akuma's climate system isn't simple. This is actually the main reason why I still can't make another step in my worldbuilding process. I need someone who can say something about it.

So, what do we have here? Planet in the strange star system, with reddish sky and red and black plants, with giant mushrooms all over the place. Volcanoes and different electromagnetic stuff happen here. And volcanic winters... Not the best place to live. If you think that this planet looks like Hell - you are right! It definitely is!

Well. That's not all. It is a fantasy setting and what a fantasy without magic? Yeap, there is magic here. Considering all BD's effects I suppose that local magic exists because of it. So here on Akuma a lot of anomalous places can be found. You know, all of this stuff with tectonic faults, ley lines, mysterious zones... So, polar regions are big fucking territories FULL of anomalies! 

All gods, spirits, demons and even souls could be considered as sentient anomalies. Well, I'm still thinking about magical stuff. I have an idea of ""Dreamlands"" or ""Dream realm"", and, well, it mostly exists in dreams (or mind) of... giant mycelium web! But almost nobody knows it. I'm not sure that fungi need sleep though... So a lot of magic is connected with sleep and dreams. But mostly with different electromagnetic shit. 

I can’t say much about Akuma’s magic system just because I still haven't come up with something interesting. 

I don't think it's time to speak about local races, history and cultures, because, again, I still have doubts about the most fundamental elements of this world. This is the reason why I made this post. Doubts. Overthinking. Inability to make any progress…

I hope that’s all is understandable enough. I have worked with this world since 2019 and most of the time was wasted on research and modeling. This was interesting work though, but it’s time to do something more and start write a fucking story! Well, firstly I need to build the world's history, cultures, and create interesting characters… Sometimes it’s all become quite frustrating. So. What do you think?",28 Mar 2024 15:31:40

I'm looking for some suggestions to verify my cyanobacteria cultures are not contaminated (I've recently lost their and I think it's being eaten!). Currently, I use a sample loop to streak on LB media and grow them in the dark. Unfortunately, I've seen very little consistency in the results from these plates. For example, on one day, the LB plate will grow lots of white colonies, then a sample taken from the same culture the following day does not grow any colonies.

Therefore, I'd like to find a different method to determine if there is any contamination. I have access to microscopes up to x1000 magnification, but it appears that I would need to stain the bacteria before I could view them. If I am also staining my cyanobacteria, would I be able to differentiate between the two? (My cyano are tubular and approximately 8um in length)

My goal is a de novo assembly of a \~6mb cyanobacteria genome that is known to have high structural variance and difficult-to-sequence regions, and it is also known to be a highly methylated genome. 

So far I've only managed to get an estimated 440mbs. I've found mixed information online regarding the depth and read lengths you want/need for accurate de novo assembly.

My PI wants at least a gigabase and has found that excluding <15kb reads gives an acceptable assembly for other bacterial genomes. I understand that more data will lead to a better assembly, and the plan is to get more data, but I am wondering what other researchers aim for.

I have access to a pretty powerful personal computer and I am interested in seeing what I can get from 440mbs of data, which should be roughly 70x depth. But does this sound like a fools errand? 

Also, I do have a partial assembly of the same organism/strain from a few months ago that used different chemistry/ adaptors. Could I consider this data in the alignment? I have heard that there may be issues because of different adaptors but I don't understand why this would be a problem.

We only feed the fish a tiny pinch every other day and we clean the filters and scrub clean the inside of the tank weekly and siphon out the substrate and clean everything fully every 3-4 weeks.

Speaking with the pet store, they were not sure either. They suggested it might be cyanobacteria, but it does not seem to be a sheet of bacteria, like cyanobacteria. Given its coverage, they suggested to put the two fish in a temporary tank using some of the tank water, and then clean all of the pebbles and ornaments with hot water followed by distilled white vinegar. Then restart the tank fresh with distilled or spring water and prime it to get the right environment. Then add lots of plants, which can mitigate organic waste.

Is that the correct approach? Can anyone identify what is the brownish stuff that grows over everything?

What if Mars was habitable? So, if Mars was Habitable. So, here is the Planet's new stats.

Temperature: 6-9 Celsius (Average)

Magnetic Field Size:  0.35 and 0.45 Gauss, (A little smaller than Earth's)

Now, Mars still has Tectonic Plates, like it (Probably) did 2-3 Billion Years Ago

Now, I'm going to be raising the size of Phobos and Deimos by 3.79 Because why not?  (New sizes are: 84.6 KM and 47.35 KM)

Now.. Let's get into the History.

So 3.12 Billion Years ago, Life emerges on Mars, Around 760-900 M.Y. After Earth.

Multicellular Life emerges 623 M.Y.A, around the same time as Earth.

(Note: Mars has their version of Trilobites, and most of the Archean Life on Earth such as Cyanobacteria, to name one.)

Animals and Plants on Land emerge 398 M.Y.A and 429 M.Y.A respectively.

Then, some weird Uncanny Planet Copying happens, and Dino things are on Mars, Then they get killed around 63-67 M.Y.A due to a super volcano erupting (Olympus Mons), causing Mammals to flourish.

Then around 6-9 M.Y.A, A cat-like apex predator, Named, ""Korvias Sileicus"" (Scientific name.), Now this Cat-like apex predator looks like this:

Think of a Tiger, but, with less color, more Gray, 1.65 times larger Eyes, and Sharper Teeth like a Sabretooth Tiger, but its Large long 2 Front teeth are shorter and are just barely escaping the mouth, making it look like the Predator Alien from Predator (1987.).

Now, you probably know where this is going right?..

If yes, then you're right! It is going to be evolving to be more intelligent!

Which then what happens is- Oh, you think they're..? Oh, No. You're wrong, Now, a thing I didn't say about Mars, was the fact that Mars is more rich in Iron Ore, and Resources in General, So No, they aren't warmongers.

Now, back to what I was saying.

What happens next is, that they become bipedal around 4.6 - 4.8 M.Y.A

And evolve Opposable Thumbs... Become Omnivores, etc.

Then they Discover/Invent(?) Fire (3.5 M.Y.A), make a civilization, (\~10,000 Y.A) Develop Language (\~11,670 Y.A), discover Steam, (232 Y.A) have an Industrial Revolution (210 Y.A)

Now its 1934, for the Korvais / 1931 For us, And radio has only just become widespread, around 10 Years ago for both of them,

That's when Radio Broadcasters realized their, Signals/Audio Feed/Video Feed, Scrambled and Distorted a bit, when their Attenaes were pointed towards Mars/Earth, But they just ignored this and just thought it was just weak Radio Signals.

but then, people realized that it wasn't distorted a year ago, back when Mars was in a different location, (And noticed the funny lights on the dark sides of the planets.)

In 1935/1932, Earth sent a message of the first 12 numbers of Pi (3.14159265358), multiple times on 7 Radio Frequencies into Mars's general area in space. (Also Earth were thinking the War of the Worlds could happen, but they didn't tell the public about this.)

They sent 129 Radio Signals, on 7 Different Radio Frequencies,

Through May 21st, 1932 - June 2nd, 1932. Then Mars sent the **√-1** number back, to see if there was something on Earth, And if they got a response, there was.

On June 12th, 1932, this was confirmed on both of the planets, when they got the signal, and to double-check, they sent 3.14159 in Binary. (11.001001000011111101) they sent this 3 times.

Now that's all I've written for now!

As the call for sustainable and plant-based alternatives to traditional animal products grows louder, researchers at the University of Copenhagen are exploring a unique solution involving blue-green algae, specifically cyanobacteria. In a recent study led by Professor Poul Erik Jensen of the Department of Food Science, the team demonstrated the potential of cyanobacteria to produce a protein with fibrous strands resembling the texture of meat fibers. This breakthrough could pave the way for sustainable, protein-rich foods with minimal processing, addressing environmental concerns and the quest for the right mouthfeel in plant-based products.

Cyanobacteria, often known as blue-green algae, have been manipulated to produce a protein not naturally found in their composition. By inserting foreign genes into cyanobacteria, the researchers observed the protein organizing itself into fibrous strands or nanofibers. This fibrous structure holds promise for mimicking the texture of meat, cheese, or other desired food products.

As a wise man once said, ""the sun is a deadly laser"", and early life was confined to deep oceans in order to avoid its damaging effects. Processes like chemosynthesis and nitrogen fixation were the only tools available to primitive bacteria. But at some point, cyanobacteria found a way to turn the deadly sun into a food source, by evolving photosynthesis. For the first time\*, the continuous supply of radiation provided by the Sun was being used directly to support life, rather than killing it. Photosynthesis was such an attractive new tool for life to pick up that it resulted in a 'rapid' (on geologic time) oxidation event, which formed the oxygen atmosphere that we use today for respiration.

Evolution shows us that this light-to-food process would become the most important way of supplying life with energy, as photosynthetic plants remain the producers for all food webs today.

Creationists may look at photosynthesis and point to its complexity, proclaiming intelligent design. But  complexity is well-known by now to not be a huge challenge, especially with a continuous supply of free energy in the mix, from a non-equilibrium thermodynamics perspective. With the new environment of shallow water near mineral rocks up for grabs, the first bacteria to find a way to survive there would surely be very successful, and the photosystem enzyme complexes were the result (likely in a *much* more simplified form, but whatever works will do the trick). These cyanobacteria were apparently so successful that they ended up endosymbiotic with plants that would come a few billion years later, as their chloroplasts.

So, in a very loose sense, the Sun created and maintains life. No supernatural deity required - the Sun is right there in the sky, every day!

\*Excluding any possible hypotheses regarding wet-dry cycling (repeated evaporation by the Sun and solution leading to selective crystallisation) during abiogenesis. That's another place where we could consider the Sun helping to direct the chemistry towards life.",04 Mar 2024 09:36:18

Surprisingly, it seems entirely feasible with the use of Photoelectrochemical cells, especially when paired with solar panels. Intrigued by the potential, I pondered how many cars could be powered by the hydrogen generated through this technology if implemented on the largest solar plant globally.

**So I asked to chat GPT this question:** How many cars a year hydrogen can run if it is produced through advanced Photoelectrochemical Cells that replicate cyanobacteria in producing hydrogen from sunlight if it is attached to solar panels of the largest solar-generating plant in the world.

**Here is what Chat GPT said:**

To estimate the number of cars per year that hydrogen produced through advanced photoelectrochemical cells could run, we'll use similar assumptions but adjust the efficiency and conversion factors based on the characteristics of advanced photoelectrochemical cells:

1. Solar Irradiance: We'll still consider an average solar irradiance of approximately 5 kWh/m2/day for Rajasthan, India.
2. Solar Panel Efficiency: Since we're using advanced photoelectrochemical cells, we'll assume higher solar panel efficiency compared to traditional panels, approximately 20%.
3. Hydrogen Generation Efficiency: Given the advanced nature of photoelectrochemical cells, we'll assume a higher hydrogen generation efficiency of 80%.

Using these assumptions, we can recalculate the hydrogen production per day:

* Solar irradiance: 5 kWh/m2/day
* The total installed capacity of the Bhadla Solar Park: 2.2 GW = 2.2 million kW

The total energy harvested per day can be calculated as follows:

Energy harvested = Solar irradiance × Total installed capacity = 5 kWh/m2/day × 2.2 million kW = 11 million kWh/day

Now, let's calculate the potential hydrogen production per day:

* Assuming a solar panel efficiency of 20% and a hydrogen generation efficiency of 80%, the energy converted to hydrogen would be: Hydrogen production = Energy harvested × Solar panel efficiency × Hydrogen generation efficiency = 11 million kWh/day × 0.20 × 0.80 = 1.76 million kWh/day

To estimate how many cars this amount of hydrogen could run in a year, we'll use similar assumptions as before:

* Assuming a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle efficiency of 1 kilogram of hydrogen per 100 km: Number of cars fueled per day = Hydrogen production per day (in kilograms) / 10 kilograms per car = 1.76 million kWh/day / 10 kg per car = 176,000 cars per day

Now, to estimate the number of cars that can be fueled in a year:

* Number of cars fueled per year = Number of cars fueled per day × 365 days = 176,000 cars/day × 365 days ≈ 64.24 million cars per year

So, approximately **64.24 million cars** per year could be fueled by hydrogen produced through advanced photoelectrochemical cells attached to the solar panels of the largest solar-generating plant in the world.

I'd like to think of Undine as a colonial species of Spirulina that can control water, with large colonies being able to form due to the abundant mana-rich, water of the dungeon. When these colonies form they gain a rudimentary sentience which aids them in coordinating movement and allows them to defend themselves via water jets, this sentience also makes them somewhat curious about other lifeforms, especially those with mana. When Marcille was boiling water an Undine colony was quietly observing her, only to have boiling water poured onto it haphazardly. Being a colony of microscopic Cyanobacteria Undine are extremely sensitive to abrupt temperature fluctuations, why heat and fire are effective at killing them despite being able to control water, they perceived Marcille as trying to kill it deeming all humanoid beings as threat and thus retaliated violently. The reason why I believe Undine colonies to be a species of Spirulina is that Spirulina IRL is a known superfood with many health benefits and is often used to fortify soups/stews . Since Undine Spirulina (Which i am calling Arthrospira Undinensis) are Cyanobacteria their blueish color allows them to blend into the glowing mana-rich water, which simultaneously helps it camouflage while also being able to perform photosynthesis alongside ambient mana absorption to grow and multiply. (note that in the anime, when dead the Undine resembles water and does not appear greenish, this is my own speculation on the matter)  
I'd like to imagine that to create jets of water, individual spirulina cells spin rapidly in a coordinated direction to generate high pressures, imagine if diatoms also lived in relative abundance inside Undine acting as living abrasive slurry with their silica cell walls.  
I absolutely love speculating about the more bio-magical aspects of Dungeon Meshi, it also makes me speculate ways traditionally prokaryotic organisms can perform complex behaviors that rival multicellular Arcea-Eukaryotic ones.",29 Feb 2024 13:59:05

I only have four smaller tanks, but it still feels like too much some days. I've improved as a fish keeper and I'm pretty good at setting up balanced low tech tanks, but I feel so terrible losing fish. It really weighs on me, I get stress dreams about it. I thought I'd get more desensitized to the occasional loss, I even worked at an aquatics store for a year and saw plenty of death, but still I find myself so stressed that I might lose fish that I can't enjoy them while they're healthy.

I love aquatics. The beauty of a planted tank has brought me a lot of joy, especially in the dark winters. Are these feelings normal? How do you make this hobby sustainable? Do you just have to become kinda hardened to the losses? Thank you.",28 Feb 2024 19:21:11

I recently set up a new tank because my old one had lots of Cyanobacteria but this one is having the same issue about a month in. I was wondering if there was anything I could put in the tank to get rid of that? Couldn’t find anything online and not sure if anyone has had success with that. I have lots of babies in the tank right now so I don’t wanna do anything too drastic. Thanks in advance!,27 Feb 2024 02:37:23

170,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1azxxsf,Is it bad that I’m more proud of my mostly empty 20g I haven’t touched in over a month than my heavily maintained 55g?,"The 20 gallon tank was our first tank, and we’ve since turned it into what was supposed to be a guppy fry tank when we got the 55. There used to be a bunch of fry in it. I believe about 23, but a malfunctioning surge protector caused power to go out in the bedroom this tank is in, and all but 1 of the fry were moved to the 55, where power was still on until we figured out what the cause was. The last fry was elusive and we didn’t notice she wasnt moved until about a week ago. 

During the power phenomenon, the air hose I used to keep floaters in a designated spot fell and the moss bridge was turned on its side and I just haven’t been up to moving them back lol. Weirdly, I love the feel it gives with the way they’re placed. Since then, the only inhabitants added to the tank were two blue dream shrimp (one male, one very pregnant female) and the hatchlings of bladder snails we removed from the 55. The only other change was adding a bit more frogbit. I know it desperately needs a top off and I’m planning on doing this later today.

When I first set this tank up for an expecting guppy, it had a huge Cyanobacteria bloom where you couldn’t even see the sand at the bottom and it was a huge mess. After a 9 day blackout with minimal feeding, it looked… fine I guess, but after moving the fry, the red plants in the middle have flourished beautifully and the moss is growing super well. I think this tank is gorgeous and I like to the of the air tube as a little on-ramp for the baby snails that are currently sprinkled all over it.

I don’t know what it is about the 55 gallon tank, but I’m just not as proud of it. The plants have grown in much more than when the last picture was taken because we removed all the frogbit and just kept the savinia, but it just doesn’t feel right, and right now there’s an algae problem that we’re currently working on since we removed said frogbit (a philodendron and a couple red ferns were replaced to keep up with nitrates, and it stays steady at 5ppm). The bioload of the guppies feels like a constant headache with having the gravel vac twice a week, and I know that can be fixed by giving some away but I love them all so much lol. Maybe we have to rescape it, but the work that comes with is a little overwhelming. Especially since I want to see what it’ll be like once the plants are grown in to the point I’d like before I just take it all apart. I will try to post a more up to date picture of the 55gallon once I clean the glass and do a water change so it’s not so embarrassing lol. I feel if I posted what it looks like now it would for sure end up on a certain shitty aquarium subreddit, if the 20g doesn’t end up there already.",25 Feb 2024 15:26:21
171,https://www.reddit.com/r/SurveyCircle/comments/1az0d06/ive_tried_talking_to_a_lot_of_people_who_are/,"I've tried talking to a lot of people who are experts, but they either don't respond or sometimes they pretend they haven't seen it, but I've studied this for a long time, and I believe it can be useful.","An important person told me this and said it was important but no one listens, he saw that it might be possible to create a bacteria that stays dormant and is woken up with light or sound or other methods that could be effective, but no one ever responds to me or reads what I say.

There are some studies that show that it is possible to activate or inactivate certain genes of viruses or bacteria using light, through a technique called optogenetics. Other studies suggest that sound could be used to direct drug-loaded nanoparticles to tumor cells.

Some bacteria can enter a state of dormancy, called sporulation, when conditions are unfavorable. In this state, they form a resistant structure, called a spore, which can remain inactive for long periods, until conditions improve.
It is necessary to understand that bacteria can be genetically modified in the laboratory, to acquire new characteristics or functions. For example, scientists can insert genes that make bacteria produce proteins that react to light or sound, such as opsins or mechanosensitive ion channels. These proteins can alter the metabolism or gene expression of bacteria, causing them to come out of dormancy or change their behavior.
As for the idea of using bacteria to treat cancerous tumors, this is already a reality in some cases. There are bacteria that can invade and destroy tumor cells, release substances that activate the immune system or produce enzymes that convert inactive drugs into active ones within the tumor. These bacteria are called oncolytic bacteria, and some of them are already being tested in clinical trials. Or even have the bacteria killed by a ray of light using CRISPR/Cas9 so that it can kill the bacteria as soon as they have finished their work.

It is possible to create a bacteria that stays in this state of dormancy and is woken up with light, if more light were emitted the bacteria could be exterminated later

If the activation, deactivation or extermination of these bacteria were plotted by AI, the treatment would be much more accurate, effective and predictable.

An example of research that uses these techniques is that of Chen et al., published in 2016. They created a synthetic bacteria that can be activated by red light and that produces a protein that kills cancer cells. They tested this bacteria in mice with tumors and observed that it significantly reduced cancer growth without affecting normal cells.

One of the possibilities is to use bacteria that form spores, which are resistant structures that allow bacteria to survive in adverse conditions. These spores could be activated by some stimulus, such as a lack of oxygen, which is common in tumors. Another possibility is to use bacteria that are sensitive to light, such as cyanobacteria, which carry out photosynthesis. These bacteria could be inhibited by light and activated by darkness
In this case, the correct option would be to leave a dose that almost kills the bacteria so that the stronger ones form spores and the weaker ones can die, even the strongest ones would be at their limit, and could only really flourish where there is no light, if they Even so, I can go to another tissue, light must be sent with greater intensity for it to be exterminated, there would only be a chance that they would survive until they reach the tumor, if they did not survive it would just be a case of repeating the process.
The immune system could get in the way, but eventually some bacteria would survive, and then they would proliferate in the tumor.

I don't know if it will be like this, but it's an interesting path.",24 Feb 2024 12:39:53
172,https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/1ay12te/where_does_each_governorate_get_its_name_from/,Where does each governorate get its name from?,"Making this list for those who love etymologies like I do. Sorted by governorate population size:

* **Cairo:** There seems to be a lot of opinions about this. One of them is that when the caliph el Moez l-Din Allah reached Cairo from Mahdia in Tunisia, he called it ""Qahirat el Moez,"" meaning the ""Conqueror of Moez."" Another one is that it was named after Mars, which was called ""al Nagm el Qahir"" or ""Conquering Star"" at the time, as it was visible in the sky on the day it was founded. Lastly, it could be related to the old Egyptian name for it, which was ""khere-ohre,"" meaning ""place of combat"" in reference to a battle between the gods Seth and Horus that happened here. The western ""Cairo/Caire"" comes from Italian, as that's how they interpreted it.

* **Giza:** Exact etymology unknown, but there are some theories. One is from the Egyptian ""r-gs-ḥr,"" meaning ""on the side of the high one"" in reference to the Great Pyramid. Another is from the Persian ""dizz,"" meaning castle or fortress, again referring to the pyramids. It could also be from the Syriac ""gissa,"" meaning ""side,"" also probably referring to the side of the Khufu pyramid.

* **Sharqia:** Meaning ""eastern,"" probably referring to it lying east of the Nile delta? Couldn't find anything on it. Its capital is Zagazig, whose name can be traced back to the Coptic ϫⲉⲕϫⲓⲕ (pronounced tsek-tsik), meaning a small insect like an ant.

* **Dakahlia:** From an old town called Dakahla, which is actually in Damietta. That name comes from the Coptic Ⲧⲕⲉϩⲗⲓ, pronounced Tkehli, meaning shrine. Its capital, Mansoura, meaning ""victorious,"" refers to the victory against Louis IX of France during the crusades.

* **Beheira:** Mohafzet el Beheira, or governorate of the lake, probably referring to Lake Edku. I couldn't find where Edku gets its name from, but it was called Tajo in old Egyptian. The capital Damanhour gets its name from the Coptic ⲡϯⲙⲓⲛ̀ϩⲱⲣ (p-Timinhor), from the ancient Egyptian p-dmi-n-Hr-w or temai en Heru, meaning ""settlement of Horus."" In Aramaic, it was called Temenkhour.

* **Minya:** From Coptic, which was ⲧⲙⲱⲛⲏ (Thmone) in Bohairic and ⲧⲙⲟⲟⲛⲉ (Tmoone) in Sahidic. This is related to the ancient Greek μονή (monee), meaning ""station"" or ""stopping place."" It could also come from the ancient Egyptian mn-ꜥt-ḫwfw or Men'at Khufu, meaning ""the nursing city of Khufu.""

* **Alyubia:** From the ancient Greek name Καλλιόπη (Calliope), referring to the goddess of poetry and music. Its capital, Banha, is named after the Coptic ⲡⲁⲛⲁϩⲟ (Banaho), from the old Egyptian per-neha, meaning ""house of sycamore.""

* **Sohag:** From the village of Suhay. Etymology unknown.

* **Alexandria:** Obvious one, but it was named Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia) by Alexander the Great, who specifically founded the city to bear his name. Well done, Alexander.

* **Gharbia:** The Western governorate, probably referring to its location as well. Its capital, Tanta, comes from the Coptic ⲧⲁⲛⲧⲁⲑⲟ (Tantatho). Etymology unknown, but it could be from the Demotic ṯntjn.t, which I don't know what it means or how to pronounce it. The other big city, El Mahalla el Kobra, means ""the big district,"" which might be a translation of the Coptic ϯϣⲁⲓⲣⲓ (ti-Shairi), meaning ""residence"" or ""encampment.""

* **Asyut:** Directly from the old Egyptian name Zawty, which turned into Seyawt in late Egyptian, then to ⲥⲓⲟⲟⲩⲧ (Siout) in Coptic, meaning ""guardian."" An A was added to ⲥⲓⲟⲟⲩⲧ to make it Asiout.

* **Monufia:** From the Coptic ⲡⲁⲛⲟⲩϥ (Panouf), from the ancient Egyptian pꜣ-jw-nfr, meaning ""the good island."" Possibly related to the Egyptian pr-Jnpw (House of Anubis), then the p/b eventually turned to an f.

* **Fayoum:** From the Coptic Ⲫⲓⲟⲙ, Ⲡⲉⲓⲟⲙ, and Ⲡⲁⲓⲟⲙ, all roughly pronounced Fiom, Peyom, and Payom, from the late Egyptian pꜣ-ym, meaning ""the lake"" or ""the sea,"" referring to the nearby Lake Moeris.

* **Kafr esh-Sheikh:** ""Village of the sheikh/chief"" after Sheikh Talha el Tilmisani. Previously called el Fuadiya, afte King Fuad I. Its older names are derived from Coptic but are now obsolete.

* **Qena:** Possibly from the ancient Greek Καινή (Kaine), meaning ""new city,"" which was named during the Hellenic Ptolemy dynasty.

* **Beni Suef:** The current name is a corruption of the old name Manfiswayh, which comes from the Coptic phrase ⲡ-ⲙⲁ-ⲛ-... (p-ma-n-..., the place of ...). It's unknown what this refers to.

* **Damietta:** From the Coptic ⲧⲁⲙⲓⲁϯ (Tamiati), likely from the old Egyptian dmj-t, meaning port or town.

* **Aswan:** From the Coptic Ⲥⲟⲩⲁⲛ (Souan), from the ancient Egyptian Swenett. The ancient name was written using symbols that mean ""trade"" or ""market.""

* **Ismailia:** Named after Khedive Ismail Pasha.

* **Luxor:** From the Arabic Al-Oksor, meaning the palaces. Possibly a translation of the Coptic ⲡϣⲟⲙⲧ ⲛ̀ⲕⲁⲥⲧⲣⲟⲛ (pshomt enkastron), meaning ""three castles."" The original Coptic name, ⲡⲁⲡⲉ (Pape), can be traced back to a Demotic Ỉp.t, meaning the [adyton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adyton). It's all got to do with massive structures.

* **Suez:** From the Arabic sous, relating to liquorice.

* **Port Said:** Another obvious one. The Europeans named it after the French word port and Said Pasha, the ruler of Egypt at the time.

* **Matrouh:** I couldn't find anything on this.

* **(North and South) Sinai:** From the Biblical Mount Sinai, which is believed to be in the Sinai peninsula. The name possibly comes from the Mesopotamian word Sin, referring to the moon god, who is also related to the Egyptian moon god Thoth, who was worshipped in Sinai in ancient times. There are many other theories on the origin of the name, you can read them [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai_(Bible)#Etymology_and_other_names). The capital of North Sinai, El Arish, is a possible Arabisation of the Greek Αριζα (Ariza), which used to be its name, or it could be related to the Arabic word 'arsh (hut), as it used to be a new settlement of huts. Some people also connect it to the Coptic name ϣⲱⲣⲡⲟ (Shorpo). Meanwhile, the capital of South Sinai is et-Tor, but its etymology is unknown.

* **Red Sea:** This one is obvious. The Red Sea possibly gets its name from the tint of the cyanobacteria and other life forms that live in it. Its capital is Hurghada, which comes from the Arabic name of a native tree called ghardaq.

* **New Valley:** I remember reading that it got its name in the Mubarak era when they planned on carrying out new agricultural products in the largest governorate of the country. Fun fact, the New Valley alone makes up about half of Egypt's size, and is comparable in size to Iraq. Anyways, its capital is the Kharga Oasis, which probably gets its name from the translation of the ancient Greek name Εσωτερο (Esotero), meaning ""outer.""",23 Feb 2024 08:58:25

I’ve had my betta since last August. He’s been in his current tank since December. 
There was a Cyanobacteria outbreak about a month ago. I treated it with blue green slime. This was around the time my betta got multiple tears on his fin. Cyano went away but came back with a vengeance. I’ve stopped treatment about two weeks ago and just manually removed what I can.
Today my betta started acting lethargic, mostly lays on the bottom, and struggles to get to the top and eat. I reduced the water level just now in hopes that will help him a bit, but I’m not sure what else I can do :(
Water test is showing 0 ammonia/nitrite/nitrate. Not sure if cycle crashed (I didn’t do any other treatment besides the blue green slime) or if the cyano is sucking up all the nitrate?
I’d appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks.",21 Feb 2024 20:36:24

I’d be grateful for advice. I have an established 250L mixed reef (8+ years) and for the last six weeks I’ve been struggling with diatoms and Cyanobacteria. 

Parameters at the last test (also confirmed with an external ICP test):
- PH 8.0
- SG 1.025
- KH 7 (dose every other day, always runs between 7-8 and has done for 8 years)
- Ammonia <0.05
- Nitrite 0.05 
- Nitrate 1
- Phosphate <0.02
- Silicate <0.1
- Calcium 440 
- Magnesium 1280

I dose Seachem fusion 1 and 2 every other day, have done for about a year. 

I run carbon and Rowaphos, no changes in how I run them or batch of either. 

UV unit is definitely working (indicator light says so anyway). 

Lights are LEDs (Juwel Multilux - has to be a closed top tank because otherwise the cat climbs in it). Have been running for four years, same bulbs. 

Fish are all fine. Corals mostly fine, have lost a few heads of Euphyllia over the duration but everything else is fine (lots of euphyllia, stylophora, Duncan, blasto, candy cane, acropora, favia and toadstool all fine). 

Nothing has changed that I can think would induce the bloom. Things I’ve tried so far and seen no improvement:

- Changed UV unit bulb and cleaned inside unit. 
- Rinsed filter media (always done on schedule and sponges changed regularly on schedule, no difference over last 8 years) and cleaned pipes. 
- Sequential 10% water changes daily for a week (including vacuuming of the sand bed). 
- 60% water change. 
- Added more clean up crew (4 weeks ago, no change)
- Salt batch is the same as I’ve been using for 8 months but I changed it as a precaution, still no improvement. 
- Changed RO/DI resin and membranes, no improvement (TDS 0).
- Filter bacteria addition. 
- Tried various angles of circulation and wave pumps, no change. 
- Reduced light cycle by two hours, no change. 

I’m at a bit of a loss for what to do. Has anyone got any suggestions? 

Thanks!

178,https://www.reddit.com/r/TDNightCountry/comments/1atywmf/the_first_page_in_clarks_notebook_might_explain/,"The first page in Clark’s notebook might explain what’s poisoning Ennis, and the Tsalal Logo","We’ve decoded almost every page in Clark’s binder except for this one, which is the first page and looks quite boring and innocuous.

Here’s what it says, but it helps to know one thing before you read it. OCP’s = [Organocholine Pesticides](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/organochlorine-pesticide). OCP’s are hydrocarbons and known carcinogens.

https://preview.redd.it/3ox10ig3hdjc1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bc710857c485085178b321f506347a661018af6

Here’s the transcription:

“Our recent assessment of screening level risk from glacially mobilized OCP’s in Alaska identified potential cancer and disease risk from long term fish consumption in the proglacial watershed. Human consumption of local fish put health risk in the Swiss Alps just above screening level thresholds, even though the region is characterized by low levels of fish consumption. The elevated fish consumption in subsistence group of the Alaskan Arctic indicates the need to explore the potential presence of OCP’s in Alaskan glaciers and meltwater in order to characterize possible human health risks. Furthermore, Alaskan glaciers are losing mass at an increasing rate necessitating prompt study of OCP glacial entrainment to determine if pollutants are entering the glacier watershed below.”

Two extraneous things to note - 'The haphazard use of such chemicals may negatively affect the soil microbial population including phosphate-solubilizing bacteria'. ([source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7931423/#:~:text=The%20haphazard%20use%20of%20such,population%20including%20phosphate%2Dsolubilizing%20bacteria.&text=The%20negative%20effects%20of%20OCPs,been%20confirmed%20by%20various%20studies))  And there’s an interesting connection to Cyanobacteria, mentioned in Clark’s binder and also heavily on this sub. ‘Cyanobacterial species are also potential candidates for removing contaminants from soil and water, thereby contributing to establish a sustainable agricultural practice.’ ([source](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3298/7/2/13#:~:text=Another%20common%20cyanobacterium%2C%20Anabaena%20azotica,establish%20a%20sustainable%20agricultural%20practice))

So it’s possible that it’s not the water poisoning everyone directly, but the consumption of the food chain residing in these waters where OCP’s are melting at a rapid rate, probably accelerated due to climate change. The passage indicates that the ‘subsistence group’ aka indigenous population heavily reliant on consumption of local fish who are more at risk. Cancer is an obvious result, but so are reproductive issues.

Also, if we're dealing with hydrocarbons, there is strong presence of the HEXAGON shape in the molecular structure.  One major class of OCP's is  [hexachlorocyclohexane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexachlorocyclohexane).  It looks like this: 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wvet55npidjc1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e70c319bc2002a5210d192affd4d15abef97669

Since Tsalal is looking at the concentration of OCP's in the ice and glacial meltwater, it's possible these are the numbers they were fudging for Tsalal.  

This also could correlate with the Tsalal logo, which is something I’ve been trying to crack since the beginning. I first saw stick people, but then I noticed the frostbite symbol looks similar to part of the Tsalal logo. Then I noticed the hexagon at the center of the logo, which looks very similar to a benzene ring. It feels like the logo represents a frozen benzene molecule.  But no benzene rings have really manifested in the story, until this page in Clark's binder, and maybe the fact that so many Ennis residents seem to have and/or die of cancer.  (Including Travis)

[Tsalal Logo](https://preview.redd.it/7er4u0pojdjc1.png?width=282&format=png&auto=webp&s=c31fafeee31bbd92a8b59a82723409d52a906781)

The Silver Sky Mining logo also features the hexagonal shape. I think in both cases the hexagon might reference the hydrocarbon pollutants.  Someone on this sub noticed the [hexagon shape](https://www.reddit.com/r/TDNightCountry/comments/1ajic18/the_tsalal_research_center_and_silver_sky_mining/) popping up in the show.

The star in the SSM logo might represent radiation.  Like from a star, like the sun.  There’s been some potential references to radioactivity.. the microwave symbol in the very beginning of ep1 (2nd symbol we see in the whole show after Tsalal logo) and randomly the fan in the corner of the Tsalal TV room, and in some other quiet locations throughout the show. The fan looks like the global symbol for radioactivity to me. Could be nothing but why would anyone in Ennis have a fan?? Tsalal fan also missing it’s cover so it makes the blades stand out. I might be over reading it, but always noticed the fan. Lastly, when Clark has his seizure, if you listen closely (listen…) it sounds like he’s getting zapped with something. There’s an extra kind of buzzing sound there, kind of like a microwave. Personally I don’t think it’s just a seizure.  

Anyway, I’ve really enjoyed all the rabbit holes this show has plunged me down. And this sub. I’ve learned so much about so much.",18 Feb 2024 12:05:48

I started doing that last night and ended up with an image-only post and some rather dense text in the comments. So here I'll summarize those scientific clues and add others, from science or from what we know more or less for sure in the plot. I have no problem with the show's spirits and ghosts at all, but I won't include them here.

1. The scientists were doing ice coring, and wee a bunch of tubes with samples in E1. I haven't gone back to see the numbers but I bet they are missing at least one tube: something that looks very much like part of an ice coring tube appears inside Clark's trailer, near the crown-like object cradling Annie's phone. 
2. ""Night country"", an underground system that is very like comprised of caves and human-made or augmented tunnels is likely to have several access points, 3 of which, I think, are human-built structures dedicated to extraction: the dredge, the mine and the Tsalal station. The dredge, like most dredges in the region in the second half of the twentieth century, probably was used to extract gold. Silver is usually mined together with gold and in ""gold"" mines. I'm assuming the dredge was abandoned because gold ran out, maybe sometime in the 90's (we know Navarro saw it active as a child.) The mine, then, is probably mining silver. It is also, given what we know, that is doing something else. Mine is not that profitable so whatever they are hiding, I think it's unlikely to be silver. Tsalal, on the other hand, is extracting something else. Danvers is told ""the origin of life"".
3. Clark's binder has many clues. His field is paleomicrobiology, so we should expect for him to be interested in microbes and fossils. The pages of the binder, titled **Atmospheric CO2, dust, global temperature affect deposition of microbes in glacial age""** has several thought provoking microbes, including samples of fungi (Altenaria alternata and Alternaria sp.) and bacteria (Bacillus lichenformis and Bacillus \_\_\_\_\_\_). There's a third bacteria sample, M.vaginatus. Clark's research revolves around CO2, dust, global temp, and how microbes are deposited/organized in glacial ice.
4. Alternaria fungi are not very nice, at least not for humans. They ruin lots of agricultural plant products, for one. They also thrive when atmospheric C)2 increases, so its one of those species that doesn't mind climate change, might even welcome it. Alternaria is not uncommon, and not good for humans. The main symptoms it can cause if breathed or drank from the water are respiratory symptoms, but it can also attack [the eyes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3981128/)or [the tongue](https://www.journalmc.org/index.php/JMC/article/view/395/260).

While allergies or respiratory/asthma symptoms are the most common, skin, tongue and eyes can be affected, especially if the person's inmune system is compromised. On ocassion they have been found to cause **fertility issues and birth defects.**
5. B. lichenformis and many other bacteria in the same genus can also be beneficial for agriculture, and many are probiotics as well. They don;t appear to be harmful to humans. Fun fact, though: they can reduce or stop the growth of Alternaria fungi. Hmmmmm..... 
6. Theories and speculation: the fossil is an ancient snake or snake-like creature covered in cyanobacteria colonies, hence the ""hairy"" look of the fossil. The ice coring from Tsalal accidentally freed alternaria fungi into the town's water supply (think of it as an oil spill but underground) because the scientists were careless when ice coring and didn't think to protect the town. Science, then, represented by Tsalal, is presented as just another form of extraction, and so the indigenous Alaskans have been subjected to extraction (the red flag of colonialism) time and again, if in different forms.  the hair blue. Maybe blue hair is not only nice looking but part of some spiritual practice? Also, in the trailer we see a comb next to Annie's phone. Remember how shamans calm Sedna by combing her hair?\]
7. The next pages of Clark's binder are covered in crazy hand-writing and drawings, including tons of what look like eyes and repeated phrases ""her fingers"", ""her eyes"", ""I can hear her"", and so forth. I'll add the picture again in the comments. But they also contain significant images: 1)2 cultures, meaning someone put microbes such as those bacteria and fungi above, in a petri dish, where it or they grew. Now: the teacher-geologist told Danvers that ice coring for living organisms was impossible. Judging from those cultures, it was not, and they found living microbes. The last culture shows what looks like cellular division, so whatever is in there is definetely growing. The title of that page is indeed ""autosomal DNA section"" and you can actually see chromosomes! What's in that culture? Is it one of the microbes, or something else? I dunno, maybe some cells missing from a tongue?
8. Leaving the binder now. The [fossil:](https://www.reddit.com/r/TDNightCountry/comments/1anpqsp/its_older_than_the_ice/) it was quickly described as whale bones by the teacher-geologist-cheating husband, but I don;t like it. I may be way off, and I am certainly not a paleontologist, but that fossil (pictured here) looks more like an ancient [snake](https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-snake-fossil-by-bruce-montagne-146777860.html?imageid=690372E4-1E5B-4A3B-800B-E3150AC5F88A&p=256165&pn=1&searchId=5ab38dc9b9462a3b03ed79420254c5f8&searchtype=0) or long reptile to me. Which is intriguing, because guess what kind of ocean-dwellingorganism is often found in a symbiotic relationship with[cyanobacteria](https://ucmp.berkeley.edu/bacteria/cyanointro.html#:~:text=Cyanobacteria%20are%20aquatic%20and%20photosynthetic,colonies%20large%20enough%20to%20see)algae-like, blue green colonies?? Sea snakes in the present. Their ancestors likely did the same. ""Older than the ice"", like Rose said. I just think an ancient sea snake is more likely to contort in the spiral shape we see in the fossil in the ice image from Annie's phone than a whale, prehistoric or not. 

Theories and speculation: the fossil is an ancient snake or [snake-like](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/43943/20230524/snake-legs-95-million-year-old-fossils-challenges-understanding-serpents.htm) creature covered in cyanobacteria colonies, hence the [""hairy""](https://wildshores.blogspot.com/2010/04/why-are-marine-snakes-banded.html)look of the fossil. The ice coring from Tsalal accidentally freed alternaria fungi into the town's water supply (think of it as an oil spill but underground) because the scientists were careless when ice coring and didn't think to protect the town. Science, then, represented by Tsalal, is presented as just another form of extraction, and so the indigenous Alaskans have been subjected to extraction (the red flag of colonialism) time and again, if in different form. The dredge, the mine and the station will be revealed as connected via colonial and neo-colonial interests (hopefully not Tuttle, but I'll take it), and colonial extraction is historically coupled with the killing, often genocidal, of the native populations (don't forget those stillborns!). Local population is driking alternaria in their water (this is particularly likely  if their water comes from a well, or if the pipes are closer to the extraction sites), because standing water is more likely to be colonized by fungi) and having fertility issues and stillborn babies as a result. (I don't know anything about the hallucinations.) I have to cook but may add more thoughts later.

Unfortunately, one of those said plants died. The other two plants that popped up are doing fine though, so I don't it was related to the oxygen levels. Instead, I think that one plant's death was related to it being too close to the rotting banana peel piece. It's not too surprising to me since the thing happens when plants get too close to dead stuff in my other systems. If it's not too much dead stuff and the plant has already grown to a decent size, only a few leaves wilt and the rest of the plants keeps living. Very young sprouts aren't quite so resilient though. Since the current banana peel piece seems pretty well broken down by now, I think I'll drop a new piece on top of it later today and see how that affects things. If the other two plants that sprouted up in the compost side end up dying as a result, then I'm fine with that. It's all part of the experiment. Besides, I'll still the aquatic plants in the primary oxygen producing side and (hopefully) the compost side's soil algae/cyanobacteria along with it. See you all next time! 😀",17 Feb 2024 10:41:35

185,https://www.reddit.com/r/corydoras/comments/1arqu20/a_lot_of_albino_cory_concerning_appearance_and/,A lot of Albino Cory concerning appearance and behaviors .... please advise :(,"**Background:**

I have a 10g with 6 Albino Cories (I'd like to upgrade the tank but don't have the space for it right now unfortunately). Also have some Assassin Snails and Zebra Nerite Snails (going to be setting up a snail tank soon, because my Assassin Snails bred like crazy). No pest snails are left because of the Assassins. There's a fair amount of plants floating around. pH is ~7.4, Ammonia and Nitrite are 0ppm, and Nitrate is 10ppm. When I first had 3 of the fish, there was some Ammonia/Nitrite poisoning that happened for a while before I could get it under control. There's a cyanobacteria issue but I manually remove it to keep it in check.  Finally, I've been watching the fish behavior almost daily and they're eating, scavenging, swimming, doing normal cory things. 

**I would really appreciate some advice on the following problems, even just some of them if you can't answer all.**

**Problems:**

1) One of the cories (I'll call him ""Bingo""), when you look at him head on, it looks like his sides are bulging way out. Not in a pregnant way but in a pointier way? It's kind of prominent (don't know how I didn't notice before), and it doesn't look natural -- I am concerned.

2) On Bingo, I saw a dark spot on two of his bottom fins as well as at the tip of his tail fin. I'm not sure if they've came off since then or not. I found another dark spot on his underside.

3) Also on Bingo, when I was looking *really* close, I saw some whitish (not bright white) spots on his tail, except they seemed kind of radially symmetric so I can't tell if it's Ich or not. I also saw a white spot near his tail that was brighter but that could've just been scales, I can't tell.

4) I noticed Bingo was breathing quickly today after he ate, and looked a little pinkish (tbf, some of them look a little pinkish). Also, a lot of the fish have red gills, I don't know if that's permanent or if something is currently going on to cause that.

5) Some of the fish ""flash"" periodically. I talked to the vet about it and she said that given they're eating and otherwise acting normal, I shouldn't be too worried (before I knew about the spots and bulging, anyway).

6) I don't know how to describe this besides .... some of my fish ""play dead."" This has already happened a few times. Today I put food in and normally they all lose it, but one fish stayed completely motionless in the dark of under the log. I nudged him and eventually he started moving and then got all excited because food. Sometimes it takes a few pokes to get the fish ""playing dead"" to move, and then they act perfectly normal...? They are usually upright in a normal position when they do this, but once, a fish laid sideways, motionless, and after a few pokes got up and moving...? I don't know why they do this. 

7) I also found a fish doing the ""playing dead"" thing except his head was buried in the sand. I honestly don't know how he could've breathed like that... I think this has only happened that way once. And after some pokes he was fine...?

8) One of the fish that ""played dead,"" after I poked him, he started swimming but seemed to have a major kink in his side. Like his side was at a maybe 120 degree angle from his head. It didn't look good. But this was maybe two weeks ago.

9) One of the fish that I had since the beginning (since the Ammonia/Nitrite issues), his eyes look all white and I'm not even sure if they're his eyes or just the sockets... I feel bad either way and want to see if I can help him. It's been this way since Summer 2023 and I tried 1 medicine but it did nothing for him. (Ironically, this guy is one of the best eaters and one of the biggest.)

10) One of my fish is motionless again but baby Assassin snails are climbing all over him.

Thanks in advance for any advice. Debating whether to talk to the vet, yet again.",15 Feb 2024 16:31:31

An important person told me this and said it was important but no one listens.","he saw that it might be possible to create a bacteria that stays dormant and is woken up with light or sound or other methods that could be effective, but no one ever responds to me or reads what I say.

There are some studies that show that it is possible to activate or inactivate certain genes of viruses or bacteria using light, through a technique called optogenetics. Other studies suggest that sound could be used to direct drug-loaded nanoparticles to tumor cells.

Some bacteria can enter a state of dormancy, called sporulation, when conditions are unfavorable. In this state, they form a resistant structure, called a spore, which can remain inactive for long periods, until conditions improve.
It is necessary to understand that bacteria can be genetically modified in the laboratory, to acquire new characteristics or functions. For example, scientists can insert genes that make bacteria produce proteins that react to light or sound, such as opsins or mechanosensitive ion channels. These proteins can alter the metabolism or gene expression of bacteria, causing them to come out of dormancy or change their behavior.
As for the idea of using bacteria to treat cancerous tumors, this is already a reality in some cases. There are bacteria that can invade and destroy tumor cells, release substances that activate the immune system or produce enzymes that convert inactive drugs into active ones within the tumor. These bacteria are called oncolytic bacteria, and some of them are already being tested in clinical trials. Or even have the bacteria killed by a ray of light using CRISPR/Cas9 so that it can kill the bacteria as soon as they have finished their work.

It is possible to create a bacteria that stays in this state of dormancy and is woken up with light, if more light were emitted the bacteria could be exterminated later

If the activation, deactivation or extermination of these bacteria were plotted by AI, the treatment would be much more accurate, effective and predictable.

An example of research that uses these techniques is that of Chen et al., published in 2016. They created a synthetic bacteria that can be activated by red light and that produces a protein that kills cancer cells. They tested this bacteria in mice with tumors and observed that it significantly reduced cancer growth without affecting normal cells.

One of the possibilities is to use bacteria that form spores, which are resistant structures that allow bacteria to survive in adverse conditions. These spores could be activated by some stimulus, such as a lack of oxygen, which is common in tumors. Another possibility is to use bacteria that are sensitive to light, such as cyanobacteria, which carry out photosynthesis. These bacteria could be inhibited by light and activated by darkness
In this case, the correct option would be to leave a dose that almost kills the bacteria so that the stronger ones form spores and the weaker ones can die, even the strongest ones would be at their limit, and could only really flourish where there is no light, if they Even so, I can go to another tissue, light must be sent with greater intensity for it to be exterminated, there would only be a chance that they would survive until they reach the tumor, if they did not survive it would just be a case of repeating the process.
The immune system could get in the way, but eventually some bacteria would survive, and then they would proliferate in the tumor.

I don't know if it will be like this, but it's an interesting path.",12 Feb 2024 01:20:44

* AP Physics teacher (9/10): SUPER close with the dude. Talked about literally everything with him and came to his office hours super often to chat.
* H. PreCalc teacher (7.5/10): Pretty close with her. DIdn't do the best in her class because of huge spike in family duties junior year. However, improved a LOT throughout the year and she told me how she emphasized that a ton in the rec)
* Research Mentor (8/10): Super close with him. Harvard Alum. WOrked with him virtually for about a year on my research project. I've read his writing before because he needed to submit a rec for science fairs I was entering. Pretty good imo)

She asked me weird ass questions like ""estimate how many barbers there are in NYC to the power of 10"" and ""if you were a fruit what fruit would you be."" I though I absolutely fucked the up the interview but at the end she told me she really fucking loved my personality and knows I was under a lot of pressure after the questions so she ""slid me an opportunity under the table"" by giving me an hour after the interview to give her an essay with everyting I would like to rephrase or reword during my interview so she can build the strongest case for me possible)
* Princeton (BEST one. Spoke for nearly 2.5 hours and found a lot of common interests in sports and poetry. Dude took the train with me home (halfway) and helped with calc hw on the way home)

**Essays**

* Personal Statement (8.5/10): Talked about how I hated Mother's Day growing up but eventually turned it into a day of self-reflection and goal-setting by realizing I could step into the role of a mother figure for my lil sister by listening to what others are appreciative of their mothers for ok Mother’s Day and setting them as goals for the upcoming year. The conclusion was a bit rushed tbh.
* Supps: I took a TON of risks with my supps. I don't think I can compete with most other CS applicants when it comes to ECs so I decided to just show more personality and tried to be more funny on supps. For Princeton's personality supp, I talked about how I wanted to learn photoshop to crop my face onto an uncle sam poster and making myself 8'5 blah blah (this went viral on the a2c subreddit recently bc of how funny it was. Check my past posts in profile if you wan read). For Harvard, I talked about shitting and flushing toilets for intellectual experience and helping my neighbor raise rent for his tenants for the ""elaborate on an EC"" supp. For Cornell, I wrote about picking underwear for girls (specifcally my little sister) for community essay. Rest assured, I worded all my supps well. I just wanted to write about unique topics to stand out more, even if it's interpreted badly by AOs. I'm honestly willing to take taht gamble cuz afterall, ivies and a lot of t20s are all crapshoots)

**Additional Info**

I listed some extenuating circumstances on my common app. In my junior year, my family duties spiked up a shit ton because my father opened a restaurant in Manhattan and often stayed overnight at there. So, I became in charge of taking my little sister to her extracurricular classes around the city after school 3-4 times a week. I would often have to get home after my school and ECs, make dinner, and take her to her classes. By the time I got home each day, it would already be 9-10PM. On top of that, the train commute back and forth from school each day is about 2.5 hours. Junior year grades dropped a fair bit as a result.

As for college results, I was kinda shocked about UIUC. I decided to apply like an hour before the deadline and wrote my supps in like 30 mins lmao

198,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1amvxes,Cyanobacteria bloom over my corals and rocks - should I be doing something to get rid of it?,"Hi, this is in my 20 gallon. I started it mid-December so it is going through some cycles. I had an issue with hair algae covering my corals and rocks but got 4 Trochus (on top of my 4 astrea and 2 turbo) as well as reducing food from 1 cube of brine shrimp in the morning and 1 cube in the night to half a cube in the morning and half a cube in the night and it seems to be solving the issue nicely. Unfortunately, now cyanobacteria has started blooming and covering some of the algae - covering my poor zoas (who are somehow still coming out) entirely. 

What should I do to get rid of it? It doesn’t really seem like the trochus eat it and I don’t want it to suffocate my coral.",09 Feb 2024 14:09:18
