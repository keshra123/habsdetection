EPA scientists developed the app to help local and state water quality managers make faster and better-informed management decisions related to cyanobacterial blooms. Compatibility and Availability The CyAN app is available as two versions: CyANWeb app and the CyAN Android™ app. Both are free apps that require an internet connection and provide the same information using different platforms. The CyANWeb app is a web browser-based interface available on EPA's website that will work with any operating system and is compatible with most devices. The CyAN Android™ app is available for download on Google Play™ and is designed for use on Android™ devices; it is compatible with versions 4.2-9.0 (API levels 18-26). Disclaimer: Any mention of trade names, products, services, or enterprises does not imply an endorsement by the U.S. Government or EPA. Google Play and the Google Play logo are trademarks of Google LLC. Capabilities and Applications Capabilities: The CyAN app provides an easy to use, customizable interface to scan water bodies for changes in cyanobacteria occurrence without requiring computer programming expertise. It provides water quality managers a user-friendly platform that reduces the complexities associated with accessing satellite data to allow fast and efficient initial assessments across water bodies that are roughly one square kilometer or greater. Users can view information about cyanobacteria concentrations on a national-scale or can zoom in to single-out data for a lake or reservoir. Because states and localities may address harmful algal blooms differently, users can determine their own thresholds for cyanobacteria concentrations. Users can also compare multiple water bodies at once, allowing for better-informed decisions based on recent changes at specific locations. Applications: Because the CyAN app uses satellite data to map the location of cyanobacterial blooms in fresh and coastal waters across the U.S., it can be used to quickly inform decisions regarding recreational and drinking water safety. Lake managers, for example, could use the CyAN app on a daily or weekly basis to monitor lakes in their region. At a quick glance of their computer or mobile device, they could pinpoint potential problem areas and focus their attention and resources. The data might prompt them to manually collect water samples from certain lakes for more information or issue a public advisory to close local shores to recreation. Note: The CyAN app is an experimental mobile application and provides provisional satellite derived measures of cyanobacteria, which may contain errors and should be considered a research level tool. The primary satellite sensor collecting data is the European Space Agency’s Copernicus Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument . Background and Research Collaboration To ensure that current data is provided, EPA is continuing research and collaboration efforts with NASA, NOAA, and USGS through the CyAN Project . Most species of algae are not harmful, but sometimes certain types bloom in excessive amounts and can cause harm to human and pet health, aquatic ecosystems, and local economies. Referred to as harmful algal blooms (HABs), they are usually associated with algae that have the ability to produce toxins and can cause environmental and health problems. Even though they are classified as bacteria, cyanobacteria—sometimes referred to as blue-green algae—exhibit characteristics of algae and are associated with HABs. Cyanobacterial HABs, which can appear in water bodies across the country, are an indicator of poor water quality and can potentially cause serious environmental concerns, including human and aquatic health effects. When blooms occur in recreational waters or source waters used for drinking, the toxins that may be released can cause respiratory or skin irritation and even illness in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Historically, monitoring cyanobacteria blooms has been labor intensive and limited due to cost, time, and logistical constraints. EPA researchers are looking for ways to eliminate or reduce the negative effects of HABs on human health and the environment. Their efforts include the development of both versions of the CyAN app. The research that led to the development of the CyANWeb app and the CyAN Android™ app was conducted in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Both versions were tested separately for over one year and the functionality and satellite data were successfully validated and published in multiple peer-reviewed publications.

Here we show that phosphoketolase in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 ( Se XPK) possesses a distinct ATP-sensing mechanism, where a drop in ATP level allows Se XPK to divert precursors of the RuBisCO substrate away from the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. Deleting the Se XPK gene increased CO 2 fixation particularly during light–dark transitions. In high-density cultures, the Δxpk strain showed a 60% increase in carbon fixation and unexpectedly resulted in sucrose secretion without any pathway engineering. Using cryo-EM analysis, we discovered that these functions were enabled by a unique allosteric regulatory site involving two subunits jointly binding two ATP, which constantly suppresses the activity of Se XPK until the ATP level drops. This magnesium-independent ATP allosteric site is present in many species across all three domains of life, where it may also play important regulatory functions.

PCC 6803 Article Open access 16 December 2020 Anushree Bachhar & Jiri Jablonsky Main Terrestrial phototrophic organisms draw down about 120 Gt of carbon from atmosphere annually primarily through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle 1 . Similar figures have been estimated for marine organisms. This flux is about ten-times higher than that emitted by anthropogenic release of CO 2 2 , 3 Thus, an increase in the biological carbon fixation by even a few percent would greatly influence the carbon balance on earth. Cyanobacteria utilize solar energy to split water and produce NADPH and ATP via photosystems and the electron transport chain to support carbon fixation via the CBB cycle 4 . The CBB cycle accounts for the vast majority of carbon fixation on earth 5 , 6 , 7 , in which RuBisCO is the major enzyme catalyzing conversion of CO 2 and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Subsequent steps require ATP and NADPH to reduce 3PG to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) as precursors for glycogen synthesis or to regenerate RuBP to continue the CBB cycle (Fig. 1a ). The regulation of CBB cycle involves multiple factors and mechanisms, including light, redox potential and circadian regulation 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . As a marine organism, cyanobacteria frequently experience underwater light fluctuation and encounter environmental stress. The cell has to shut down CO 2 fixation rapidly in low-ATP conditions to avoid futile cycling resulting from simultaneous CO 2 fixation and respiration. Although all ATP-dependent reactions proceed slower at low ATP levels, it is desirable to stop the CBB cycle preferentially and immediately to prevent non-productive resource draining; however, such a mechanism has not been discovered. On the other hand, if this mechanism can be exploited, carbon fixation in cyanobacteria could be increased. Fig. 1: Effects of ATP on the activity of Se XPK. a , Proposed roles of Se XPK in response to ATP levels. When ATP levels are high during photosynthesis, Se XPK is inactive. When ATP levels are low, Se XPK would break down CBB cycle intermediates, including Xu5P, F6P and S7P, to stop carbon fixation. b , Plots of the initial activity of Se XPK against different concentrations of F6P in the presence of 0, 0.5 or 1 mM ATP and saturating 30 mM phosphate ( n = 3 individual reactions, mean ± s.e.m.). c , Enlarged plot from b , in the region of F6P below 20 mM. Source data Full size image Phosphoketolase (XPK) belongs to the transketolase family, a member of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzyme superfamily 12 , 13 . It converts F6P, xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P) or sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), which are intermediates in RuBP regeneration, to produce acetyl phosphate (AcP) and C3, C4 or C5 sugar phosphates (Fig. 1a ). XPK is also a key enzyme in the synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis 14 , 15 and has been exploited for engineering metabolism 16 , 17 ; however, its physiological role in cyanobacteria is not fully understood. A previous report 18 suggested that XPK in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. is responsible for utilization of xylose or glucose under heterotrophic conditions. We have shown 19 that the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 XPK ( Se XPK) is inhibited by ATP and participates in ATP production through the XPK–acetate kinase (ACK) pathway for long-term survival under anaerobic, dark and osmotic stress conditions. While deleting Se XPK did not affect growth under constant light or a 12 h/12 h light/dark (12-h L/D) cycle under aerobic conditions 19 , overexpression of Se XPK caused lethality. The role of XPK in carbon metabolisms and its ATP inhibitory mechanism are still puzzling in cyanobacteria under phototrophic growth conditions. In the CBB pathway, allosteric AMP inhibition of fructose-1,6/sedohaptulose-1.7-bisphosphatase has been reported in Synechocystis 6803 (ref. 20 ). In glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (Pyk) from Synechococcus PCC 6301 is inhibited by ATP 21 . Moreover, a CO 2 fixing enzyme PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in Synechocystis is regulated by Pll sensor-transducer, which is allosterically modulated by adenyl nucleotides 22 . In the absence of Pll, PEPC is inhibited by ATP. The above studies elucidated the importance of allosteric enzyme regulations by adenyl nucleotides in metabolic pathways. Considering that Se XPK is inhibited by ATP 19 , we propose that XPK may play a heretofore unrecognized role in dynamic metabolic regulation by diverting the RuBisCO substrate precursors away from the CBB cycle when ATP is low (Fig. 1a ) to avoid futile cycling. If so, its function would be most pronounced under low-ATP conditions, such as during light fluctuations, and the molecular mechanism of ATP sensing by XPK would provide a useful insight. Furthermore, if XPK serves as a metabolic ‘brake’ for the CBB cycle, it could be deleted or inhibited to increase CO 2 fixation, thereby increasing the net carbon draw down by cyanobacteria and even producing useful compounds. Results Se XPK functions as a CBB brake upon ATP drop We first performed steady-state kinetic analysis, which suggested that Se XPK is inhibited in vitro by ATP through an allosteric mode (Fig. 1b,c ), similar to Cryptococcus neoformans XPK reported previously 23 . On the other hand, Bifidobacterium longum XPK showed no inhibition by ATP (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Based on the kinetic data, the activity of Se XPK should be constantly inhibited when the intracellular ATP concentration is about 1 mM or greater; however, immediately after transition from light to darkness, ATP drops to 0.4 mM (Fig. 2 ), which should relieve the inhibition of Se XPK. Fig. 2: Delayed cessation of CO 2 incorporation by Δxpk after light-to-dark switch. a , Three WT and the three Δxpk cultures were grown in BG11 medium containing 50 mM NaHCO 3 under 12-h L/D cycles until the OD 730 reached 1 (top). Then, during hours 5–6 in the light period, both cultures were refreshed with BG11 then supplied with 2 mM NaH 14 CO 3 , as time 0, under 50 μmol m −2 s −1 light. The light was switched off 10 min later. The 14 C incorporation was analyzed for samples collected at 5, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 20 min. The 14 C incorporation % ( y axis) was calculated by 14 C cell / ( 14 C cell + 14 C medium ) ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). Under the same experimental conditions as above, WT and Δxpk cultures were supplied with 2 mM unlabeled NaHCO 3 (bottom). Equal volumes of culture samples from each time point were collected and the ATP concentration was determined by a luminescence-based assay, as described in Methods ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). b , WT and Δxpk cultures were grown under 10-min L/D cycles then supplied with 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 at the end of the night, as time 0. c , Same as b , except for growing under 250-min L/D cycles. Source data Full size image To investigate the role of XPK under the low-ATP conditions, we measured the carbon incorporation by the wild-type (WT) and XPK deletion ( Δxpk ) strains during the transition from light to dark. We grew these strains under 12-h L/D cycles until the optical density at 730 nm (OD 730 ) reached 1. In the middle of the light period, NaH 14 CO 3 was added to the cultures and carbon incorporation and intracellular ATP concentration were measured before and after switching to darkness. Results show that the carbon incorporation was similar between the WT and Δxpk strains in the presence of light (Fig. 2a ); however, upon abrupt switching from light to dark, the carbon incorporation by the WT strain began to decrease, coinciding with the ATP drop. The net carbon incorporation continued to decrease, presumably due to carbon release in the dark period, whereas the intracellular ATP concentration recovered due to respiration. In contrast, the Δxpk strain continued incorporating CO 2 for about 5 min in darkness, suggesting that the cell in the absence of Se XPK was not able to stop CBB activity immediately upon abrupt switching from light to dark. To further validate this result, we evaluated carbon incorporation of the WT and Δxpk strains in two continuous L/D cycles at different frequencies, 10 min/10 min or 250 min/250 min L/D periods (Fig. 2b,c ). In both cases, the carbon incorporation by the WT and the Δxpk strains were equal during the light phase. When entering the dark phase, the carbon incorporation was immediately reduced in the WT strain, but continued to increase in the Δxpk strain for several minutes, again coinciding with the ATP drop (Fig. 2b–d ). The continued carbon uptake by the Δxpk strain in dark indicates the lack of CBB brake provided by XPK. On the other hand, the ATP level was not affected by the XPK deletion, suggesting that XPK’s primary role is the regulation of CBB cycle activity in response to the ATP level, but not the regulation of ATP level itself. Although XPK produces AcP, which leads to acetate and ATP production, the ATP production efficiency by respiration is much higher and dwarfs the contribution of XPK. The CBB regulation by XPK is distinct from the well-known post-translational oscillator KaiABC, which controls various processes, including CBB cycle genes 8 , 24 . The regulation by XPK also complements a thioredoxin-modulated protein CP12, which forms an inactive ternary complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) to reduce carbon fixation in dark or oxidative conditions 11 . Deletion of CP12 in S. elongatus PCC7942 retards growth and reduces O 2 consumption through respiration at night 25 . In contrast, Se XPK reduces carbon fixation by sensing a sudden drop of the ATP level (Fig. 2 ), but its deletion does not affect growth under normal conditions 19 or influence O 2 evolution in light and consumption in dark (Supplementary Table 2 ). Se XPK removes RuBisCO substrate precursors when ATP is low To further investigate the function of Se XPK, we measured the levels of 13 C-incorporated metabolites in the WT and Δxpk strains upon the light to dark switch for the three conditions in Fig. 2 . NaH 13 CO 3 was added immediately before light to dark switching and the levels of 13 C-incorporated metabolites were measured. Results showed that 13 C-labeled glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) were higher in the Δxpk strain relative to the WT in all three L/D conditions (Fig. 3a , with original data in Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The 13 C-labeled xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P)/ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) levels were higher in the Δxpk strain under the interrupted light and 10-min L/D conditions. The levels of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) were also higher for 10-min and 250-min L/D cycles, compared to the WT. In contrast, 13 C-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) were slightly less or not changed in the Δxpk strain compared to WT (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1b ). These data suggest that Se XPK in WT drained these precursors of the RuBisCO substrate to stop CO 2 fixation after switching to dark. Without such a brake in the Δxpk strain, the cell continued to fix carbon using the remaining ATP and NADPH, while starting the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative pentose pathway and respiration to generate ATP and reducing power. Simultaneously fixing CO 2 and producing CO 2 can form a futile cycle with a net drain of ATP, which can adversely affect cell physiology in general. Fig. 3: The increases of 13 C-labeled RuBisCO substrate precursors in Δxpk after transition to darkness. Three WT and the three Δxpk cell cultures were grown under constant light (top) or different L/D conditions (middle and bottom) until OD 730 reached 1. Equal amount of NaH 13 CO 3 was added to the WT and Δxpk cultures in the middle of the light as 0 min (arrow) immediately before the light was turned off (black bar). a , XPK substrates (F6P, Xu5P and S7P) are RuBisCO substrate precursors.

G3P is a catalyzed product by XPK. 3PG, 2PG and AcCoA are intermediates and products in glycolysis. The 13 C-labeled % was analyzed as the % of 13 C / 12 C. The 13 C-labeled and unlabeled 12 C-metabolites were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring using LC–MS/MS, as described in Methods . The sum of the peak area from the 13 C-labeled metabolite ( 13 C) was divided by the total peak area consisting of the area from the unlabeled 12 C metabolite ( 12 C) and the sum area from labeled 13 C. n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.

Source data Full size image Deletion of Se XPK increases net carbon fixation and enables sucrose production in high-density cultures In addition to L/D switching, we looked for other conditions that may reduce intracellular ATP levels. We found that the ATP level decreased when the cell density increased in a shaking culture (Fig. 4a ), presumably due to self-shading 26 and high-frequency light fluctuation. We then measured the 14 C incorporation by the cells at different cell densities during the light phase in the 12-h L/D cycle. Notably, we found that the Δxpk strain incorporated more CO 2 than WT even during the light phase as the cell density increased from 2 to 5 at OD 730 (Fig. 4b–d ). At OD 730 = 5, the Δxpk strain fixed 63% more carbon than the WT strain (Fig. 4d ), based on their slopes within 30 min. Thus, Se XPK in the WT strain can reduce carbon fixation by sensing low levels of ATP under self-shaded, light-fluctuating conditions. Fig. 4: High-density culture of the Δxpk strain enhanced net carbon fixation resulting in sucrose secretion at night. a , Cellular ATP levels decreased at high cell density. Three WT and the three Δxpk cultures were grown under 12-h L/D cycles. Light intensity was 50 μmol m −2 s −1 .

Equal amounts from each culture were collected at the end of light (white) and at the end of dark (gray) and the remaining bicarbonate was converted to CO 2 and measured. The net carbon fixation in the WT and in the Δxpk was 1 g l −1 and 1.6 g l −1 , respectively after 4 d. f , 13 CO 2 was released from the WT and the Δxpk cultures into medium in dark. The cultures were fed with 100 mM NaH 13 CO 3 for 2 d in 12-h L/D cycles then refreshed with BG11 before transition to dark. The carbon release at 60 min was set as 1 and the relative value at each time point is presented. g , Δxpk synthesized sucrose in the light and secreted sucrose in the dark.

( a – h ). Source data Full size image Then we assessed the net carbon fixation of long-term, high-density WT and Δxpk cultures in a 12-h L/D cycles with the cell density from 4–7 at OD 730 . The Δxpk culture again showed increased bicarbonate consumption compared to the WT culture in the light periods. In the dark periods, approximately half of the pre-fixed carbon was released via respiration. At the end of the 4-d culture, the WT and Δxpk cultures respectively consumed 1 g l −1 and 1.6 g l −1 of carbon of bicarbonate and dissolved CO 2 (Fig. 4e ). To investigate the effect of Se XPK deletion on the respiratory carbon release, we grew the WT and Δxpk cultures with NaH 13 CO 3 for 2 d to label the cellular components with 13 C, then washed away the residual NaH 13 CO 3 in the medium and measured 13 CO 2 release from both cultures in darkness. The result (Fig. 4f ) showed that the WT and Δxpk cultures released equal amounts of the pre-fixed 13 C after switching to darkness, suggesting that deletion of Se XPK did not affect respiration. Hence, Se XPK functions as a CBB brake but is not involved in carbon release during dark respiration. To determine the distribution of the fixed carbons, we measured the amounts of biomass and sugar contents of the WT and Δxpk strains during the 4-d culture (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Notably, the increased carbon fixation by the Δxpk strain mostly resulted in sucrose secretion, which was synthesized during the light phase and excreted in the dark phase (Fig. 4g ). At the end of 4 d, 1.3 g l −1 of sucrose was excreted from the Δxpk culture, which is tenfold higher than that from the WT culture. The amount of biomass and protein showed no difference between the two cultures (Extended Data Fig. 2b,d ), whereas more sucrose but less glycogen was detected in the Δxpk culture (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). To determine whether the deletion of Se XPK caused any global gene expression change, we measured transcriptome profiles from the WT and Δxpk cultures with cell density of 2 at OD 730 , under 12-h L/D conditions. Our RNA-seq data showed only minor global transcriptome differences between WT and Δxpk (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b ). In particular, the expression level of the cation efflux protein was lower in the Δxpk strain compared to the WT; however, its function is not yet characterized. Additionally, a few membrane-associated proteins were also downregulated in the Δxpk strain. Deletion of Se XPK did not alter the expression levels of carbon metabolic genes under the conditions examined. This result implied that Se XPK influences carbon fixation primarily at the metabolite level. Se XPK facilitates survival under high-frequency L/D cycles As the function of Se XPK was observed mainly during the L/D transitions, we evaluated whether Se XPK would have an impact on growth under different frequencies of L/D cycles. The diurnal (12-h L/D cycle) growth curves of the WT and Δxpk strains were very similar (Supplementary Fig. 2 ), in agreement with previous results 19 . Then we dotted equal amount of WT and Δxpk cells on BG11 agar plates and observed their growth at different frequencies of L/D cycle from 1 cycle per day (12-h L/D) to 360 cycles per day (2-min L/D). Imaging and autofluorescence measurements of the growing cell dots revealed that high-frequency L/D cycles reduced the growth rates of both the WT and Δxpk strains, but substantially more so for the latter (Fig. 5 ). These results suggest that XPK facilitates cyanobacteria survival in rapid L/D transitions. In control, no growth differences between the WT and Δxpk strains were observed under low-frequency L/D cycles. Thus, Se XPK’s function as a CBB cycle brake under low-ATP conditions is also important for cell survival in high-frequency L/D fluctuation. Fig. 5: Se XPK functions as a regulator in rapid light–dark cycles. a , WT and Δxpk cells were first grown under continuous light for 2–3 d. Aliquots of both cultures were adjusted with culture medium to equal cell density with OD 730 = 1. Both were subjected to tenfold serial dilutions (10 −1 , 10 −2 and 10 −3 ) and dotted on the BG11 medium containing agar plates for continuous growth under different frequencies of L/D cycles for 4 d. The 10 −3 dilution culture dots did not grow and thus are not shown. b , Autofluorescence ( y axis) of the dotted WT (black) and Δxpk (orange) cultures was monitored during the culture time (day, x axis). The fluorescence intensity for each cell dot from the 10 −1 dilution was plotted and the growth slopes per day were calculated from the linear phase day 2 to day 4 ( n = 4 biological repeats, ±s.e.m.). Source data Full size image Unique ATP-binding motif in XPK Given the importance of the physiological role of Se XPK, we solved the cryo-EM structures of Se XPK, both free (with coenzyme TPP/Mg 2+ bound) and complexed with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP. In contrast to the published XPK structures from Lactococcus lactis and B. breve/longum , which exist as dimers in crystals 27 , 28 , 29 , the cryo-EM structure of Se XPK is a dodecamer composed of six dimeric units, forming a circular donut-shaped array both for the AMPPNP-bound form (Fig. 6a , Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3 ) and in the absence of AMPPNP (Extended Data Fig. 4a , Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3 ). The dimer is assembled face-to-face with two AMPPNP molecules residing head-to-head at the dimer interface in-between the C terminus of the subunits, approximately 30 Å away from the catalytic site of the respective subunit (Fig. 6b , with density maps in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Comparison between the free and bound dimers in the same orientation (Fig. 6c,d ) shows that the two subunits jointly bind two AMPPNP. The key residues, H706 and Y710 from reciprocal subunits (helix α24 based on Supplementary Fig. 3 ), sandwich AMPPNP in the dimer interface by forming π–π stacking interactions with the adenine ring of AMPPNP. The α- and β-phosphate groups of AMPPNP are stabilized by H706, H719, R721 and R753 and the γ-phosphate group by R711 from the reciprocal subunit (Fig. 6e ). Furthermore, unlike most other ATP-binding sites, there is no Asp or Glu within 5 Å of AMPPNP and no detectable divalent metal ion binding to the PPNP moiety. Instead, the negative charges of PPNP are mainly stabilized by the positive charges of the adjacent Arg and His residues (Fig. 6e ).

Further explanation with a stereo views is provided in Extended Data Fig. 7 . Primed residues designate residues from the reciprocal subunit in the dimer. Full size image Even though H706 and Y710 on two different subunits are the key residues for ATP binding, they are also key residues for maintaining the integrity of the dimer interface (Fig. 6e ). Thus, H706A and Y710A lost most of their catalytic activities to nearly the limit of detection (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e ). As the corresponding residue of H706 is Arg in the non-ATP-inhibited XPK from B. adolescentis 19 and B. longum (Supplementary Fig. 3 ), we tested and confirmed that the XPK-H706R mutant was active but not inhibited by ATP (Extended Data Fig. 1f ). Another notable residue involved in the binding of ATP is R711, which forms a salt bridge with the γ-phosphate of ATP and explains the lack of inhibition by ADP (Extended Data Fig. 1g ). The results demonstrate the power of cryo-EM in enzymology 30 . For comparison, we also solved the cryo-EM structure of B. longum XPK and found it to be an octamer, resembling the recently reported structure with calcium instead of magnesium ions 31 (Extended Data Fig. 4b , Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3 ). Of note, while the dimer–dimer interface in the Se XPK dodecamer involves residues near the C terminus, the B. longum XPK octamer involves residues near the N terminus. Comparison between the C-terminal interfaces of free Se XPK and free B. longum XPK structures provides a structural basis for the lack of ATP inhibition in B. longum XPK (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). As the donut-shape or four-leaf clover shape-like particles or two-dimensional (2D) class average images were not in perfect symmetry (Supplementary Figs. 4b , 5b and 6b ), we further examined whether the assigned symmetries were pseudosymmetry. As described in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7 , some relative random motions were observed between different dimers in both Se XPK dodecamer and B. longum octamer assemblies, suggesting the likelihood of pseudosymmetry in these structures. Structure-based searches of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 32 were performed to determine whether there is any similar ATP-binding mode in 5,933 protein structures complexed with ATP, ADP, AMP or analogs. The search criteria are defined in Extended Data Fig. 8a . The PDB structures meeting the requirement of the atomic distances are listed in Source Data File 1 (226 structures). Most of these structures, however, have both aromatic residues from the same polypeptide chain. Only three structures consist of two aromatic residues from different subunits of a dimer positioned nearby the adenine ring (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d ). For all of these, only one aromatic residue forms ring stacking with the adenine ring of the nucleotide and none has an additional Arg nearby. Therefore, no structure matches the full criteria, supporting the uniqueness of the ATP-binding mode. The root-mean-square deviation between the structures with and without AMPPNP-bound is very small: (0.42 Å from 7,897 Cα atoms of the dodecamer and 0.36 Å from 1,256 Cα atoms of the dimer). Nonetheless, ATP binding to the allosteric site could cause conformational change of active site residues through a pathway of local conformational changes involving three structurally observable steps, as summarized in Fig. 6f and detailed in Fig. 6g–n and Extended Data Fig. 5b–d , with further explanation by stereo views in Extended Data Fig. 7 showing important roles of P702–W703 in these conformational steps. In step 1, ATP binding affects side-chain conformations of residues in helix α24 as explained above (Fig. 6g–j ; in two different views). In step 2, the W703 side chain from both subunits wobble in two alternative positions and form an H-bond interaction with D551 from the same subunit or N555 from the other subunit; both are highly conserved residues from helix α19. Also, W703 forms a cation-pi interaction with K707 (Fig. 6i–l ). In step 3, these interactions lead to closer contact of the active site loop with the adjacent conserved catalytic residues such as Y492–N540 and K593–D538 interactions (Fig. 6m,n ), which could impede substrate binding. Presence of the ATP-regulatory motif in all three domains of life The above structural and functional analyses identified eight important residues (P702, W703, H706, Y710, R711, H719, R721 and R753) for the allosteric inhibition of Se XPK by ATP (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7 ). These residues are conserved in other XPKs reported to be inhibited by ATP 19 , 23 , leading to a conserved motif PWX 2 H a X 3 Y’R’ a X 7 H b XR b X 31 R c , where a,b,c designate histidine or arginine at different positions and primed residues cross-interact with the reciprocal ATP molecule as illustrated in Fig. 7a . This representation is equivalent to Fig. 6e , where each ATP molecule interacts with residues from both unprimed and primed subunits. In support, the XPK variants not inhibited by ATP from this work and previous reports 19 , 33 are not conserved at these positions (Fig. 7b , rows 9–12). Fig. 7: Proposed ATP-regulatory motif and its occurrence in diverse microorganisms. a , Schematic illustration of how two conserved motifs (red and blue) jointly interact with two ATP molecules (red and blue, respectively). Primed residues cross-interact with the reciprocal ATP molecule. b , The conservation of the structurally characterized ATP-regulatory motif (labeled in red) among phosphoketolases that have been biochemically characterized to be inhibited (1–8) or uninhibited (9–12) by ATP 19 , 23 , 33 . c , Construction of a neighbor-joining tree for the 3,190 ATP-regulatory motif-containing protein sequences (with all eight motif residues identical, except that R a is allowed to be K also for fungus due to reported data in row 8). The NCBI accession nos. of all sequences are in Source Data File 2 . The subset of methanotroph is shown here and some other subsets are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9 . d , Comparison of sequence logos from randomly chosen 1,377 cyanobacterial sequences (NCBI taxid, 1117), 176 methanotroph sequences (NCBI taxid, 135618) and 1,194 fungus sequences (NCBI taxid, 33154) for the eight conserved residues in the ATP-regulatory motif along with their surrounding residues. The motif residues are shown in green, blue and orange colors, respectively. Residue numbering is based on Se XPK, Methylomonas sp. DH-1 and C. neoformans var. grubii H99, respectively. The logos were constructed by use of the WebLogo 3 web server 70 . Source data. Full size image Next, we investigated the prevalence of this motif by NCBI BLAST in a non-redundant protein database 34 . From the 4,930 phosphoketolase sequences with >60% sequence identity to the Se XPK, 3,175 sequences showed all eight residues identical (Fig. 7c and Source Data File 2 ). A subset of these sequences with ≥70% identity is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 . These phosphoketolase sequences predominantly belong to cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and actinobacteria phyla. As expected, they include a number of aquatic cyanobacteria, including marine species such as Synechococcus , Oscillatoria , Anabaena , Okeania and Acaryochloris . Among the proteobacteria phylum, the major groups are phototrophic and methanotrophic bacteria, including Methylomonas sp., known for bioengineering applications 35 , 36 . The remaining sequences came from a wide variety of species, including sulfur-oxidizing autotrophic bacteria, acidobacteria, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria; human pathogens Spirochaetes , Parachlamydiaceae and Cryptococcus (fungi); plant pathogen Pestalotiopsis (fungi); and Euryarchaeota archaeon (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Source Data File 2 ). The actual number of species could be larger if conserved residues in addition to identical residues are included, such as replacing the R a residue with a lysine (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). To compare the relative abundance of the sequences containing the ATP-regulatory motif between different species, we then constructed sequence logos from sets of sequences without pre-selection for cyanobacteria, methanotroph and fungus, for the eight motif residues and their surrounding ones (Fig. 7d ). The results suggest that the regulatory motif is highly abundant in cyanobacteria and methanotroph and substantially less so in fungi. Further structural and functional analyses of other systems are highly warranted. Notably, the ATP-binding motif also exists in methanotrophs and methylotrophs, which do not have the CBB cycle but use the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle 37 to assimilate C1 compounds, including methane, methanol and formaldehyde. To test this motif prediction, we cloned a methylotrophic Methylomonas sp. XPK in E. coli and overexpressed and purified the protein. Indeed, its allosteric inhibition by ATP was validated based on steady-state kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i ). As RuMP and CBB cycles share many common enzymes and metabolites, including the XPK substrates Xu5P, F6P and S7P, it is conceivable that XPK also serves as a metabolic brake in response to the ATP level to regulate the RuMP cycle. Indeed, as methane and methanol in the environment are scarce and their supply may be intermittent, an XPK control of its assimilation based on its energy level may be of importance. Discussion XPK is an enzyme present in many microorganisms, primarily involved in substrate-level phosphorylation to produce AcP. Cyanobacterial XPK, however, evolved to acquire a unique mechanism to bind to ATP at the interface between two subunits through its N-terminal residues. The binding leads to a conformational change of active site residues to inhibit its activity. With this ATP-sensing activity, Se XPK stops carbon fixation when ATP levels are low, by diverting CBB cycle intermediates to AcP, which may proceed to produce acetate and ATP (Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 10 ). Typically, low ATP levels occur at the transition between L/D periods. Alternatively, during high-frequency light fluctuation caused by self-shading or ocean vertical currents, ATP levels could also drop. Under these conditions, if both CBB cycle and respiration are functional, the simultaneous operation of both leads to a futile cycle with a net effect of draining ATP. Se XPK evolved to avoid this wasteful activity and represents a distinct mechanism to control carbon fixation through CBB. Thus, Se XPK facilitates cell survival under high-frequency light fluctuations. Fig. 8: XPK serves as a CBB cycle brake under low ATP conditions. Under normal ATP conditions (>1 mM), which occur at sufficient light or during dark periods when respiration is fully functional and CBB stops due to the lack of reducing power, XPK is inhibited and serves no function; however, during sudden environmental changes (for example self-shading and high-frequency light fluctuation), the ATP level drops and XPK is relieved from inhibition. XPK then diverts the CBB intermediate to stop CO 2 fixation and produces AcP, which is then converted to acetate and ATP. Full size image The regulatory role of Se XPK is not essential under constant light and 12-h L/D cycle conditions. Thus, deletion of Se XPK does not affect growth; however, in a high-cell-density culture with self-shading, deletion of Se XPK increased net carbon fixation, due to the lack of the CBB cycle brake. Notably, the increased carbon fixation flux primarily results in sucrose secretion. Thus, Se XPK interrupts carbon fixation and prevents sucrose excretion in response to low ATP; however, the link between Se XPK deletion and sucrose secretion remains unclear. Unlike introducing synthetic pathways or overexpressing CBB pathway genes that increase carbon fixation, deletion of XPK achieves these goals without additional gene modifications 38 , 39 , 40 . In contrast to most studies on enhancing photosynthetic carbon assimilation or reducing respiratory mechanisms, it is rare that deletion of a single gene elevates net carbon fixation toward sugar production 41 , 42 . The deletion of Se XPK can be combined with other metabolic engineering strategies to increase the production of sucrose or other products. Another example has been discovered in Synechocystis Δeda mutant whose 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate (KDPG) aldolase is lacked in the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. KDPG cannot be converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate but enhances CBB flux and glycogen formation 43 . Sucrose production in cyanobacteria is used as osmoprotective compound to balance the osmotic potential between cell interior and exterior 44 . Previously, by adding salt to a sucrose-secreting strain expressing cscB , a heterologous sucrose/proton symporter, in S. elongatus PCC7942, sucrose production was dramatically increased up to 0.9 g l −1 a day 45 . Additionally, overexpressing sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in S. elongatus UTEX2973 produced 1.1 g l −1 sucrose a day without salt stimulation 46 . The xpk deletion enables sucrose synthesis, probably due to its increase in the substrate levels for SPS (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). G1P is the precursor for UDP/ADP glucose formation, then SPS converts UDP/ADP glucose and F6P to sucrose phosphate. Subsequently, sucrose is formed via sucrose phosphate phosphatase. Of note, the Δxpk strain synthesized more sucrose but accumulated less glycogen in Δxpk (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). Unlike sucrose synthesis, which can proceed with UTP, glycogen synthesis requires ATP to form the glucan chain. In the WT strain, XPK functions as a CBB brake under low ATP levels. When ATP is again available, carbon fixation resumes immediately. In the Δxpk strain, carbon fixation via CBB continues even under low ATP levels and produces excess hexophosphates, which are then converted to sucrose and secreted. As CBB continues in the Δxpk strain, glycogen breaks down to G1P, followed by phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and ED pathway to replenish CBB intermediates 47 . This may explain the lower glycogen amount in the Δxpk strain (Extended Data Fig. 2c ). While glycogen and sucrose can both store energy in the cell, storage of sucrose increases osmotic stress. As a result, sucrose is secreted from the Δxpk strain. Hence, the role of XPK is to prevent two wasteful processes under low ATP conditions: futile cycling between carbon fixation and respiration and sucrose secretion. The secretion of sucrose by Δxpk in the dark without osmotic stress broadens the conditions from our previous results 19 . Cyanobacteria have capability for exporting compounds such as saccharides, acetate, lactate and toxic metabolites 48 . According to the membrane transporter database TransportDB2.0 (ref. 49 ), S. elongatus PCC7942 contains ten major facilitator superfamily protein transporters and some of them may participate in multidrug and sugar efflux. These may be responsible for sucrose secretion; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanism involved in sugar secretion. Overall, these findings suggest that the ATP allosteric regulation of XPK, with a newly identified binding site that is widely present in nature, provides a sensitive metabolic brake to C1 carbon assimilation cycles in response to ATP shortage due to sudden environmental changes and is particularly important for marine cyanobacteria as the cells are constantly subject to intermittent supply of light. As the CBB cycle shares many steps with the RuMP cycle in methylotrophs, it is conceivable that the same ATP-sensing mechanism is used to control methane and methanol assimilation in these organisms (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i ). How this mechanism can be exploited to increase C1 assimilation presents an interesting topic for further studies. Methods Recombinant protein expression and purification S. elongatus PCC7942 XPK (Synpcc7942_2080) was constructed under a pDC vector harboring a lac promoter and its N terminus was in-framed with a 6His-tag for nickel column purification. H706R, H710A and Y710A S. elongatus mutants were generated via QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). B. longum XPK (BIL_11880) and Methylomonas sp. DH-1 XPK (AMY39_18755) were also constructed by using the above plasmid. Se XPK, its mutant variants and B. longum XPK were individually transformed in E. coli DH5αDE3.1 strain. Recombinant XPK proteins were expressed by adding 1 mM IPTG in 5 l LB culture supplied with 250 µg ml −1 spectinomycin and incubated in 30 °C, 150 r.p.m., for 16–20 h. The purification procedure followed that of Suzuki et al. 50 with some modifications. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A, containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), 1 mM MgCl 2 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). The suspended cells were disrupted with a homogenizer (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3), then centrifuged at 20,000 r.p.m., 4 °C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to an open column stuffed with cOmplete His-Tag purification resin (Roche). The resin was equilibrated with buffer A before loaded with protein sample. The sample-loaded resin was subjected to washing steps with buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and increased concentration of NaCl (from 0.1 M, 0.4 M to 1 M NaCl). Before protein elution, the resin was further washed with buffer A to reduce the salt content and was subsequently washed with buffer A supplemented with 0.25 M imidazole to elute proteins. The eluted protein sample was concentrated and loaded into a 5-ml Q Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The protein sample was eluted with a NaCl gradient in buffer A supplemented with 1 M NaCl. The collected fraction sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/600 SuperdexTM 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM TPP and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The eluted protein was examined with SDS–PAGE for purity as well its identity with mass spectrometry. Kinetic assay XPK enzymatic velocity was determined by measuring the formation of AcP using a colorimetric method 14 . The 50-µl enzymatic reaction solutions contained 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 1 mM TPP, 1 mM MgCl 2 and different concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) or sodium phosphate (Pi). The reaction began by adding 8 µg of purified XPK. A total of 40 µl was taken from each reaction at serial time points (30 s to 2 h) and the reaction was stopped by adding 60 µl 2 M hydroxylamine (pH 6.5) in a 96-well plate. After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, the coloring reagents, including 40 µl 15% trichloroacetic acid, 40 µl 4 M HCl and 40 µl 3% FeCl 3 in 0.1 M HCl were added sequentially. Absorbance at 505 nm was then recorded on a plate reader. A standard curve using commercial lithium potassium AcP was used to relate absorbance to concentration, which showed a linear relationship between 0.3125 to 100 mM in the conditions described. The OD 505 values were converted to the product AcP in µmol and used to establish kinetic curves (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 ) and calculate the initial velocity (µmol AcP mg XPK −1 min −1 or simply µmol mg −1 min −1 ). V max and K m values were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate with another substrate held constant at a saturating level (30 mM Pi or 150 mM F6P) (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Cyanobacteria strains and growth condition Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 WT and the Δxpk strain 19 were respectively grown in 50 ml BG11 medium 51 , pH 8, supplemented with 50 mM NaHCO 3 , under a 12-h L/D cycle. The incubation conditions were 30 °C, light intensity 50 µmol m −2 s −1 and shaking speed at 150 r.p.m. Gentamycin (10 µg ml −1 ) was added to the Δxpk culture to ensure the growth of the xpk knockout genotype. The cell growth was monitored at an optical density of 730 nm (OD 730 ). The average dry-cell weight of 384 mg l −1 was calibrated for the culture with an OD 730 of 1 used for experimental calculation. 14 C incorporation experiment For the 14 C incorporation experiments (Fig. 2a ), WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicates for individual culture) were grown in the BG11 medium containing 50 mM NaHCO 3 , under a 12-h L/D cycle (light intensity, 50 µmol m −2 s −1 ; 30 °C; shaking speed, 150 r.p.m.). Then, after 5–6 h during the light period, the cultures were respectively refreshed with BG11. Then, 0.8 ml from individual culture (OD 730 = 1) was transferred to a 24-well Petri dish under light. The 14 C-labeling was initiated (time 0) by adding 0.2 ml 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 (containing 113 µCi of total 14 C) to the cultures. After 10 min, the light was switched off. Then, the cultures were collected at the time points (under darkness): 5, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 20 min and further subjected to the 14 C incorporation analyses 51 . Then, 40 µl of each labeled culture was transferred to Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters, spun at full speed for 10 s to separate cells from the medium. The cell pellet was immediately resuspended with 200 µl 0.1 M NaOH, then transferred to a scintillation vial. The cell-free medium (~40 µl) was supplemented with 160 µl BG11 and transferred to another vial. The Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail (5 ml) was then added to each vial for liquid scintillation counting analyses. The 14 C incorporation % ( y axis) was calculated by 14 C cell / ( 14 C cell + 14 C medium ) × 100 ( n = 3, mean ± s.e.m.). For the experiments shown in Fig. 2b,c , the WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches) were grown under a 10-min L/D cycle or 250-min L/D cycle. The cultures were refreshed with BG11 and adjusted to the cell density (OD 730 = 1) in the dark. Then, 0.8 ml starting culture (OD 730 = 1) was added with 0.2 ml 50 mM NaH 14 CO 3 upon switching to light (set as time 0 min). The following samples were collected at different time points from two continuous L/D cycles. To analyze the 14 C incorporation at the high cell density, (Fig. 4b–d ), the WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches) were grown under a 12-h L/D cycle until the OD 730 reached to 1 or 2. The cultures were refreshed with BG11 and adjusted OD 730 to 1, 2 or 5. After 5–6 h illumination, an 0.8-ml culture (OD 730 = 1, 2 or 5) was added with 0.2 ml 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 (set as time 0 min). ATP measurements The following procedure was based on Rust et al. 52 with modifications. A total of 0.4 ml WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches for both) were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes containing 0.14 ml 3 M HClO 4 and 77 mM EDTA. The mixture was then frozen with liquid nitrogen to stop the reactions and lyse cells. Next, the samples were defrosted and neutralized with 0.26 ml solution, containing 1 M KOH, 0.5 M Tris and 0.5 M KCl, to adjust the pH to 7. After 14,000 g centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was collected for ATP measurements. Then, 38 µl supernatant was diluted with 62 µl buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl and 50 mM MgSO 4 . To plot the ATP standard curve, 1 nM to 1 µM ATP solutions were prepared in parallel. The 100 µl sample and ATP solutions were transferred to an opaque 96-well plate and 100 µl luciferase-based BacTiter-Glo assay solution was added to each sample well. The luminescence signals from each reaction and standard were measured and then the ATP amount was quantified as showed in Figs. 2 and 4a . The measurement of O 2 evolution and consumption The amount of O 2 evolution and consumption in cells was analyzed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode along with a water-jacket cell 53 . The cell cultures (grown under light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s −1 ) containing 10 μg Chla were mixed with 2 mM potassium ferricyanide and 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (an artificial electron acceptor) in a 1-ml reaction. The reaction mixture was then placed in a stirred water-jacket cell under dark. The O 2 consumption of the cell culture was quantified by measuring the decreased amount of O 2 (μmol Chla mg −1 h −1 ). To quantify the amount of O 2 evolution from water split during photosynthesis, the cell culture was supplied with saturated light (Supplementary Table 2 ). Quantification of the 13 C-labeled sugar phosphates and acetyl-CoA The WT and Δxpk cultures (50 ml, three batches for each) were first grown under continuous light and then refreshed with BG11 medium before 13 C-labeling. At time 0, the cultures were added with 2 mM NaH 13 CO 3 and simultaneously, the light was switched off. Samples (2 ml, OD 730 adjusted to 1) were collected from individual cultures at different time points before (−5, 0 min) and after dark (1, 3, 5 min and so on). The collected cultures were then subjected to 14,000 g centrifuge for 10 s. The pelleted cells were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. The following metabolite extraction procedure was based on Dempo et al. 54 and Lunn et al. 55 with modifications. The frozen cell pellets were first mixed with a 200-µl solution (methanol:chloroform:water in a 5:2:2 ratio (v/v)) and then subjected to freeze–vortex–thaw steps for three rounds to disrupt the cell wall. Next, samples were placed in −30 °C for 2 h and subsequently mixed with 150 µl cold water before being centrifuged at 400 g for 15 min to isolate aqueous phase from protein and nonpolar phase. This cold-water extraction step was repeated once. Then, the aqueous phase was dried by speedVac at 30 °C before adding 100–200 µl water to resuspend the samples. To remove macromolecules, the sample solutions were applied to 10-kDa Ultracell centrifugation tubes. After 10 min centrifugation at 14,000 g , the flowthrough solution containing phosphosugars and soluble metabolites was isolated for following liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analyses. Each sample (10 µl) was loaded to triple quadrupole Shimadzu LC–MS 8045 with YMC-Triart C18 ExRS (metal-free column) (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9 µm, product no. TAR08SP9-15Q1PTP) at a 0.40 ml min −1 flow rate. Separation was performed as described by Campos et al. 56 , starting with 100% solvent A. Solvent B was increased linearly to 7.5% over 10 min after the starting point. From 10–13 min, solvent B was increased to 52.6% linearly and was maintained until 15 min. From 15–25 min, 98% solvent B was used to remove the remnant. From 25–30 min, solvent B was decreased to 0% for column equilibration. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. LC–MS/MS was set in the negative mode with spectra acquired over a mass range of 50–1,000 m/z. The acquisition parameters were as follows: interface temperature, 250 °C; desolvation line temperature, 200 °C; heat block temperature, 400 °C; desolvation gas, nitrogen; nebulizing gas flow rate, 3.0 l min −1 ; drying gas, nitrogen; drying gas flow rate, 5 l min −1 . All metabolites and their labeling patterns were measured by multiple reaction monitoring in the negative mode. Each peak area of 12 C- and 13 C-incoroporated metabolite was quantified. The 13 C-incorporated % of individual metabolite was calculated as ( 13 C-compound / 12 C-compound) and shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1 . Statistical significance difference of the 13 C-incorporated % between the WT and Δxpk was analyzed by one-way ANOVA ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). Sugar and biomass composition measurements To obtain high-cell-density cultures, both WT and Δxpk cultures were grown until OD 730 reached 2–3 and then were refreshed with BG11 medium before adjusting the OD 730 to 4. An equal volume of individual culture was supplemented with 100 mM NaHCO 3 and inoculated in a Corning 75-cm 2 cell culture flask for 4 d under shaking at 70 r.p.m. Two aliquots of 1-ml culture from WT and Δxpk were collected and placed in Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters and spun at 15,000 g for 1 min, to separate cells and medium. The medium sample (2 ml) was collected for extracellular sugar content analyses (Fig. 4g ). Equal amounts of the cell pellet were used for glycogen and intracellular sucrose measurements (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Fig. 4g ). The metabolite extraction method is described above. For extracellular sugar content measurements, 100-μl medium samples were first mixed with known amount of lactate as an internal control and then subjected to 3-kDa Ultracell centrifuge tubes to remove macroparticles. Then, 10 μl of the clear flowthrough was analyzed by a UHPLC Agilent 1290 infinity II system at 50 °C, using Hi-Plex H hydrogen 8 µm, 300 × 6.5 mm column. By isocratic elution with 30 mM sulfuric acid at 0.4 ml min −1 flow rate, the glucose and sucrose contents were separated and detected by the refractive index detector. The amount of lactic acid was detected by the diode array detector at UV wavelength 210 nm. For intracellular sucrose and glucose measurements, the sample extracts were quantified by monitoring the NADH production using a colorimetric method. The concentrations of the standard NADH samples were prepared from 0.125 mM to 1 mM. The extracts containing sucrose and glucose were digested to glucose and fructose by mixing with 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 6 U invertase (from baker’s yeast, Sigma-Aldrich), at 55 °C for 1 h. The cell pellet for glycogen measurement was mixed with 200 μl KOH 30% (v/v) then boiled for 30 min. Acetic acid was added to the sample for adjusting the pH to 7 at room temperature. The sample was then mixed with the enzymatic digesting reagent, containing 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 6 U ml −1 amyloglucosidase and 50 U ml −1 α-amylase. The reactions were held at 37 °C for 2 h to catalyze glycogen to glucose and then stopped by heating to 99 °C for 10 min. Then, 50 μl the digested samples were transferred to a 96-well plate and mixed with 100 μl solution containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP, 1 mM NAD and 0.6 U hexokinase (from baker’s yeast, Sigma-Aldrich) to convert glucose to G6P. The absorption reading of NADH at OD 340 was used as a blank. Subsequently, 0.9 μl G6P dehydrogenase (from Leuconostoc mesenteroides , Roche) was added to each reaction that converted G6P and NAD to phosphogluconate and NADH. The OD 340 reading was recorded per minute until the values reached a plateau. The method above was also used to quantify intracellular glucose content without invertase reactions, where the sucrose content was calculated by subtracting the glucose content. For biomass measurements (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b ), 2-ml cultures were transferred to pre-weighted Costar Spin-X centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation and freeze-drying overnight, the dry-cell weight of the cultures was quantified. The carbon content of the biomass was calculated using the formula CH 1.81 N 0.17 O 0.20 P 0.013 S 0.009 (ref. 57 ) . The total protein content (Extended Data Fig. 2d ) of the freeze-dried samples was quantified using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Net carbon fixation and respiratory CO 2 release measurements For net carbon fixation measurements, the 0.5-ml culture sample described above was collected at the end of each day and night for 4 d. The collected sample was transferred to a 20-ml glass screw-top vial. An equal volume of 37% HCl was then injected to the sample to release CO 2 into the headspace of the vial. The headspace was loaded into an Agilent Technologies 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5977B mass spectrometer. A DB-FFAP column (Agilent Technologies, 0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) was used to detect the amount of CO 2 released from the sample (Fig. 4e,f ). An NaHCO 3 standard curve was prepared using 0–100 mM NaHCO 3 . RNA-seq A total of 5 ml WT and Δxpk cultures (OD 730 ~ 1, three cultures for each genotype) were collected at four time points (light 1 h, 1 h after switching to light; light 12 h, 12 h illumination; dark 1 h, 1 h after switching to dark; and dark 12 h, 12 h darkness). Cells were pelleted by full-speed centrifugation for 10 s, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until samples were collected from all time points. Cell pellets were washed once with 300 μl QIAGEN RNAprotect cell reagent and centrifuged to remove the supernatant. Cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen and then thawed by adding 350 μl RLT solution, provided by the QIAGEN RNeasy kit. After three rounds of freeze–thaw–vortex steps, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred to the tubes and mixed with an equal volume of 100% ethanol. The mixture was then transferred to the RNeasy mini-spin columns. The following procedure was based on the QIAGEN RNeasy kit and the Invitrogen TURBO DNA-free kit. For RNA-seq experiments, RNA quality control was performed by Agilent fragment analyzer 5200. Library preparation and ribosomal RNA depletion were performed by using Illumina Ribo-Zero Plus rRNA depletion kit. All sequencing was performed on an Illumina Nextseq 2000 with P2 flowcell, 300 cycles and paired ends of 150 bp. Data were processed using CLC genomics workbench 21. Differential gene expression between WT and XPK was examined across all conditions (across group, ANOVA-like), with TMM normalization. The volcano plot y axis showed P value (−log 10 ) between WT and Δxpk (Extended Data Fig. 3a ). A heat map was generated using values normalized through trimmed mean of M values (TMM) and count per million (CPM) methods, with k -means clustering k = 4 for gene clustering (Extended Data Fig. 3b ). The RNA-seq data are deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus datasets under accession no. GSE227397 . Frequency-dependent phenotype experiments To observe the growth phenotype of WT and Δxpk mutant under different frequency L/D cycles, the cell cultures (six batches for both genotypes) were first grown under continuous light until OD 730 reading reached or just over 1. The starting cultures (1 ml) of the WT and Δxpk cells were adjusted with culture medium to obtain the same cell density with OD 730 = 1 (the 10 0 culture in Fig. 5a ). Tenfold serial dilutions were made from the starting culture to obtain three additional cultures annotated as 10 −1 , 10 −2 and 10 −3 . Six aliquots (10 μl each) of the individual culture were simultaneously dropped onto the same BG11 plates to give six replicated cell dots. After allowing dots to dry under continuous light, the plates were imaged (day 0) and then subjected to different L/D frequency cycles for 4 d. The images of the plates were taken every 24 h. Autofluorescence images were taken by Fujifilm LAS-4000 at 520 nm excitation and 575DF20 emission filter. The mean autofluorescence intensity of each cell dot (from 10 −1 ) and the mean background intensity were analyzed by ImageJ. The calibrated autofluorescence of each cell dot was obtained (Fig. 5b ) after subtraction of the background intensity. Cryo-EM specimen preparation and data collection Cryo-EM samples were prepared by applying 4 µl freshly purified Se XPK (~0.4 mg ml −1 , equivalent to 2.2 µM of dimer, protein buffer containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM TPP and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) to a holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3, 300 mesh copper). The grids were glow-charged at 25 mA for 40 s. For the bound form, AMPPNP was added to the protein sample at a final concentration of 2 mM. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 30 min before applying to the cryo-grids. After sample application, the grids were subsequently blotted for 4 s at 4 °C in a 95% humidity-controlled chamber, followed by plunge freezing in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To obtain the top-viewed orientation of Se XPK particles, the grid surface was pre-modified with 0.1 mg ml −1 poly- l -lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) immediately after glow discharge. For B. longum , the XPK sample grid was prepared without using poly- l -lysine because the preferred orientation issue was improved by tilting the specimen stage for an angle of 30°. Cryo-EM specimen grids were imaged on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV. For Se XPK samples, dose-fractionated image stacks were recorded on a K2 Summit detector (Gatan) operating in counting mode at ×165,000 nominal magnification (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.82 Å per pixel). Sixty frames of non-gain normalized tiff stacks were recorded with a dose rate of ~13.1 e − Å −2 s −1 and the total exposure time was set to 4.5 s, resulting in an accumulated dose of ~59 e − Å −2 (~1 e − Å −2 per frame). For the B. longum XPK sample, images were recorded on a BioQuantum K3 detector (Gatan) operating in super-resolution mode at ×105,000 nominal magnification (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.415 Å per pixel). Forty frames of non-gain normalized tiff stacks were recorded with a dose rate of ~16.8 e − Å −2 s −1 and the total exposure time was set to 2.5 s, resulting in an accumulated dose of ~42 e − Å −2 (~1 e − Å −2 per frame). The datasets were obtained with nominal defocus values ranging from 1.5–2.5 µm and data collection parameters were controlled in an automated manner using EPU v.2.10 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). No energy filter or objective aperture was implemented during data collection. The data collection parameters of individual datasets are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Cryo-EM data processing and 3D reconstruction All three datasets were corrected for beam-induced motion by MotionCor2 (ref. 58 ) and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed with Gctf 59 on the dose-weighted, aligned micrographs. For the Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ -AMPPNP-bound form and Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ datasets collected in the counting mode, unbinned movies were motion corrected and the pixel size 0.82 Å per pixel was unchanged. For B. longum XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ datasets collected in the super-resolution mode, the movies were binned twice during motion correction, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å per pixel for the final motion-corrected images. For the Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ -AMPPNP-bound form, initial particle picking was manually conducted using Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) with a small subset of micrographs. The picked particles were subjected to 2D classification. The good 2D classes were used as templates for auto-picking particles from 2,839 micrographs, which yielded particle images ( n = 260,589) for 2D classification and eliminated bad particles. Further, approximately half of the particles ( n = 123,625) were selected for three-dimensional (3D) initial model reconstruction and followed by auto-refine in C6 symmetry. The resulting 3D model and particles were then subjected to 3D classification (class 3). One of the classes possessing more than half the particle population yielded a poor 3D model and was not selected. Thus, the 61,183 particles accounting for the other two classes of 3D model were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels using Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) for the following 3D auto-refine with C6 symmetry. The resolution of the resulting 3D model was improved to 2.83 Å. Next, the particles were subjected to CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, which was followed by 3D auto-refine to improve the model resolution to 2.58 Å. The polished particle stacks were imported into cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for further processing. Additional 2D classification was performed to further discard poor particles, which yielded 59,127 particles for following homogeneous refinement in D6 symmetry using cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ). The resulting resolution of the 3D map was improved to 2.36 Å. Next, to further improve the resolution, we performed the focused refinement to refine the density of individual dimer. First, we performed the symmetry expansion (C6) and then the local refinement with a soft mask focused on one dimer without imposing symmetry (C1). The features of the focus-refined dimer were improved and the resolution was improved to 2.17 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). For Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ , the initial particle images ( n = 228,398) were picked from 3,983 micrographs and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 . The particles were subjected to 2D classification for filtering junk particles. The remaining particles were used for ab initio 3D model reconstruction followed by auto-refine with C6 symmetry using cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 . The coordinates from cisTEM 1.0.0-β were then imported to Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels for 2D classification to further eliminate the bad particles. The 3D initial model obtained from cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 and CTF refined particles were then subjected to 3D refinement by Relion3.0. For further resolution improvement, the particle images ( n = 44,708) and 3D model were then transferred to cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for 2D classification ( n = 42,625) and 3D classification (class 4). The class possessing 71.9% of the particles was selected and subjected to homogeneous refinement with D6 symmetry. Further, particle stacks in C1 symmetry were generated by symmetry expansion (D6) for the following focused refinement. A soft mask corresponding to one of the dimers was generated for the refinement, which yielded a 3D dimer density map with 2.63 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). For B. longum XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ , approximately 1.26 million particles were picked and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 from 6,289 micrographs. Initial iterations of 2D classification were conducted by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 for filtering some junk particles. The coordinates of resulting particles were then transferred to Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) and extracted with a box size of 64 pixels (384-pixel box size re-scaled to 64 pixels, bin 6) for 2D classification to further eliminate the bad particles. The good particles were re-extracted with a box size of 384 pixels and subjected to ab initio 3D model reconstruction with C4 symmetry. The resulting model and particles were used for 3D classification (class 3) with C4 symmetry. One of the classes, which accounted for 25.9% of the particles and yielded a poor 3D model, was not selected for further refinement. The remaining particles from the other two classes were used for particle polishing and 3D auto-refine by Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ), resulting in a 3D map at 2.72 Å. To further improve the resolution, the polished shiny particles and 3D maps were then transferred to cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for homogeneous refinement with D4 symmetry. Then symmetry expansion (D4) was applied to generate the new particle stacks. A soft mask corresponding to one of the dimers was generated for focused refinement, yielding a dimer 3D map with an improved resolution of 2.62 Å (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). As the donut-shape or four-leaf clover shape-like particles or 2D class average images were not in perfect symmetry (Supplementary Figs. 4b , 5b and 6b ), we further examined whether the assigned symmetries were pseudosymmetry. The final 3D cryo-EM map (D6 or D4) was subjected to symmetry expansion and generated particle stacks in C1 symmetry. One of the dimers was subjected to 3D classification (class 3). The resulting particles in each class were further used for 3D reconstruction in C1 symmetry. The animated illustrations (3D model and link shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 ) were made using the three reconstructed maps to highlight the conformational motions of the Se XPK dodecamer and B. longum XPK octamer molecules. Relative movements were observed between different dimers. On the other hand, animated illustrations of the focus-refined dimers from 3D classification (class 3) indicated negligible global variation within the dimer subunits, except a few subtle local differences. Based on these analyses, both Se XPK and B. longum XPK are suggested to exist in pseudosymmetry. The Fourier shell correlation = 0.143 standard was used to estimate the overall resolution and the local resolution was calculated by cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ). UCSF-Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ) was used to visualize the 3D density map. The detailed refinement statistics for both the dodecamer/octamer and the focus-refined dimer of individual datasets are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Atomic modeling, refinement and validation An initial model of Se XPK was generated based on PDB 3AI7 (ref. 28 ) and Se XPK amino acid sequence by using Swiss-Model 64 . This initial model was fit into the cryo-EM focused refined map in UCSF-Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ) and Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ). AMPPNP and TPP/Mg 2+ molecules were manually built into the cryo-EM map with Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ). Initial rounds of rigid body and real-space refinement were performed using Phenix v.1.19 (ref. 66 ). Each subunit may be clearer at different residues. Some local discrepancy of model fitting was rebuilt manually using Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ) based on the densities from both dimer subunits. A similar approach was used for B. longum XPK, for which the crystal structure PDB 3AI7 (ref. 29 ) was used as an initial model for model building. The refined dimer was further fit into the D6 ( Se XPK) or D4 ( B. longum XPK)-symmetrized 3D cryo-EM map for obtaining the dodecamer or octamer assembly, respectively. Initial iterations of refinement were performed using real-space refinement in Phenix v.1.19 (ref. 66 ). Several iterations of manual adjustment of the protein coordinate in Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ) followed by real-space refinement in Rosetta 67 were performed while monitoring model quality with MolProbity 68 . Several iterations of real-space refinement on the entire model were completed until refinement statistics converged. The detailed statistics of data processing, model refinement and validation are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Structural visualization and rendering of structural representation were performed using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, v.2.4.1 Schrödinger and Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ). Protein Data Bank structural search procedures Structures complexed with ATP or five ATP analogs (ANP, ACP, APC, ZAN and AGS) were obtained from the PDB 32 . There were a total of 3,063 structures (April 2021). The structures that match all of the following criteria were selected for analysis: (1) a distance of ≤5 Å between the atom C5 of the adenine ring and the atom CG (γ-carbon) of paired aromatic residues (Y, W, F and H); and (2) a distance of ≤5 Å between the phosphorus atom PG of the γ-phosphate group and the atom CZ of a nearby arginine residue. Another search only focusing on criterion (1) with an additional 2,870 structures complexed with ADP or AMP was also performed. The corresponding protein names of the matched structures are listed in Source Data File 1 . Abbreviations for the molecules in this search were ANP, AMPPNP, phosphoaminophosphonic acid adenylate ester; ACP, AMP-PCP, phosphomethylphosphonic acid adenylate ester; APC, AMP-CPP, diphosphomethylphonic acid adenosyl ester; ZAN, AMP-NPP, adenosine-5′-(α,β)-imido triphosphate; AGS, ATPγS, phosphothiophosphoric acid adenylate ester; ADP, adenosine-5′-diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; and ATP, adenosine-5′-triphosphate. Protein database search and alignment The conservation of ATP-binding sequence motif in the phosphoketolase family was investigated using Se XPK protein sequence as a query to search in a non-reductant NCBI protein BLAST database 34 , including GeneBank CDS translations, PDB and SwissProt, with a total number of 369,802,622 sequences (5 April 2021). The BLASTP was used as a search algorithm and the alignment score was assigned based on Matrix BLOSUM62. The number of target search sequence was 5,000. Among the 5,000 sequences, 4,930 sequences share at least 60% identity with the query sequence. These sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignment 69 . Additional searches were performed for the specific genera listed in Fig. 7b (rows 9–12) but with <60% identity to the Se XPK, particularly in Bifidobacterium (NCBI taxid, 1678), Lactococcus (NCBI taxid, 1357) and Lactobacillus (NCBI taxid, 1578). None was found in the non-ATP-regulated Bifidobacterium (total 112 sequences, with sequence identity >50%) or Lactobacillus (462 sequences with sequence identity >40%). Finally, Lactococcus was also examined as it is representative of homofermentative bacteria used in synthetic biology and the XPK structure from L. lactis has been reported 27 , 28 , 29 . No ATP-regulatory site was found from 93 sequences with >40% identity to S. elongatus . Statistics and reproducibility All the above measurements included three biological repeats for each genotype as the sampling size, except the phenotype experiment, for which six biological repeats for each genotype were used. With the sample size of three, the mean value, s.e.m. and the one-sided statistical t -test via one-way ANOVA can be determined. When the measuring values were under the detecting limit (by LC–MSMS) or extremely high/low from the kinetic curves, the data points were excluded. The samples were blindly numbered and randomly loaded to analytical devices. We repeated the experiments to assess the carbon incorporation rates, carbohydrate productions and enzymatic kinetics three times and to evaluate the growth phenotype twice. Similar results between different experimental repeats were obtained. For cryo-EM experiments, thousands of micrographs were collected for the individual dataset. The detailed data collection statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table 3 .

Extended data Extended Data Fig. 1 Steady-state kinetic analysis of XPK. a . Se XPK (V max 10.8 ± 0.1 µmole mg −1 min −1 ; K m 19 ± 1.5 mM) is inhibited by 1 or 2 mM of ATP, in the presence of 30 mM phosphate. b . Under the same condition, B. longum XPK ( Bl XPK) displays no inhibition by ATP. c . Se XPK is not inhibited by phosphate substrate in the presence of saturating F6P (150 mM). d . H706A mutant of Se XPK lost most activity. e . Y710A mutant of Se XPK lost most activity. f . H706R mutant of Se XPK shows only minor effect by ATP. g . ADP does not affect Se XPK activity. The inhibition curve with ATP is included for comparison. h . Methylomonas sp . XPK ( Me XPK) is also inhibited by ATP, though to a lesser extent than Se XPK. An enlarged view of the inset is shown in i . Data represent n = 3 individual reactions, mean ± SEM. Each plot represents one of the three experimental repeats. Source data Extended Data Fig. 2 Deletion of Se XPK enhanced sucrose production but did not alter biomass. a, b . Biomass and the cell optical density (OD 730 ) increase approximately equally in three WT and three Δxpk cultures in four days. c . Glycogen contents from equal volume of the three WT or the three Δxpk culture were measured in four days. d . protein content of the WT and the Δxpk in four days. e . The weights of biomass, protein, sucrose, glycogen and glucose were measured from the three WT and the three Δxpk cultures after four days. ** indicated the significant difference between the WT and the Δxpk in sucrose productions, using one-sided statistical t -test via one-way Anova. The p value = 3 × 10 −6 . a – e : n = 3 biological repeats, value = mean ± SEM. Source data Extended Data Fig. 3 Transcriptional differences between WT and Δxpk across 4 time points. WT and Δxpk were grown under 12 h L/D cycle till OD 730 reached 2. The samples were harvested 1 h after dark, at the end of dark, 1 h after light and at the end of light. Equal amount of RNA was extracted from both culture for RNA-seq analysis. a . Volcano plot between WT and Δxpk (n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± SEM). A few genes showed significant changes (red dots, p < 0.05). Their expressional fold change was less than 2 (x-axis, enlarged plot), except XPK and its downstream ACK. Thus, no global changes due to absence of XPK. The y axis represents FDR adjusted p-values, which are computed after first obtaining a two-sided Wald test p value by fitting expression data to a negative binominal Generalized Linear Model (GLM). b . The heat map showed the comparison of the 36 genes that appeared different in expression levels between WT and Δxpk (ANOVA-like statistical analysis by CLC) at 4 different time points. XPK was peaked at the end of light as an evening gene. However, the transcriptional differences are small as the z-values are ± 2. Source data Extended Data Fig. 4 Cryo-EM structures of free forms of Se XPK and B. longum XPK. a . Se XPK dodecamer and its dimer unit, with its N-, middle, and C-subdomains colored in light blue, marine and dark blue in one subunit, while the other subunit is colored in gray for differentiation. The distribution of the residues (shown in magenta spheres) involved in the dimer-dimer interface of the dodecamer XPK are primarily located at the C-terminal subdomain. The coenzyme TPP/Mg 2+ is shown in yellow/green spheres . b . B. longum XPK octamer and its dimer unit. The dimer is shown in orange and gray for each monomer. The residues involved in the dimer-dimer interface of octamer XPK are highlighted in magenta spheres. They are predominantly located at the N-terminal subdomain, in contrast to the Se XPK dodecamer. Extended Data Fig. 5 Representative cryo-EM density maps of the AMPPNP, and the key elements involved in the allosteric regulation of Se XPK. a . The representative electron density for AMPPNP modeling (residue from B subunit is labeled with a prime). A weak density blob was observed adjacent to the –PPNP moiety of AMPPNP, which appears to be too weak to be a magnesium ion. In addition, no carboxylate is in close distance (<3 Å). Therefore, it is tentatively assigned as a water molecule bridging His719 or His706 with the phosphate groups of the AMPPNP. b . The modeling of residues YPW in the free- and AMPPNP-bound XPK. In free XPK, the density can merely accomendate one W703 from either A or B subunit. Therefore, the two W703 residues are alternatively positioned downwards and upwards. Conversely, upon AMPPNP binding, the individual W703 can be modeled in two conformers, giving a dynamic swing-like motion. c . Cryo-EM density map for modeling the active site loop region (V534-S546) of AMPPNP-bound Se XPK. d . The electron density for modeling Y492 in free- and AMPPNP-bound XPK. Extended Data Fig. 6 Structural comparison of the C-terminal domain interface in S. elongatus and B. longum XPKs in the free form. a . Left: structural superimposition of the dimer form between S. elongatus (dark/light blue) and B. longum (orange/gray) with RMSD 1.046 Å from 1291 Cα atoms of the respective dimer shows the C-terminal domain (in cartoon cylindrical presentation) interface of the subunits, mainly constituted of two helices from individual subunits. Middle: the approximate distance between the helices is 10 Å in S. elongatus , wider than 7.7 Å measured in B. longum XPK. Right: the view of the interface from above (circled with red dash lines). b . Stereo view showing the different residues and distances at the ATP-binding interface in the two XPKs. In addition to the narrower space between the helices compared to the S. elongatus , B. longum XPK has an Arg replacing H706 of Se XPK, Asn replacing R721, and Met replacing R753. Therefore, B. longum is unfavorable for ATP binding. Extended Data Fig. 7 Stereo view of the expanded views of the ATP allosteric site of Se XPK. a . The free state, providing the combined views of Fig. 3g,i,k . b . Bound with AMPPNP, providing combined views of Fig. 3h,j,l . Comparison between the free and bound structures here and in the main text provides detailed information on the effect of ATP binding, for all 8 residues in the conserved motif P702, W703, H706, Y’710, R’711, H719, R721, R753 as well as the key helices α24 and α19. Since the main text focuses more on the interaction with α24, here we provide detailed explanation for the interaction with α24, which also involves dynamic features of W703 (density maps in Extended Data Fig. 5b ). P702 resides at a turn connecting the helix α24 and the loop where W703 and Y701 respectively reside. Therefore, it provides certain degree of flexibility to the local region. In the free XPK, the W703 from one subunit can reside at two positions, swinging upwards and downwards, but alternates with the other W703. When the W703 side chain swings upwards, it partially occupies the ATP binging space. In the AMPPNP-bound structure, both W703 residues swing downwards and show subtle side chain movement (side-to-side), which is stabilized by the cation-pi interaction with K707 and an H-bond between C=O of Y701 and NH of W703. Such interaction is also likely facilitated by P702. The three residues form a beta-turn like configuration to keep W703 side chain pointing downwards and interact with D551 or N555 from helix α19. In addition, the dynamic feature of W703, assisted by its neighboring residue P702, could function as a regulatory switch in response to ATP binding. Extended Data Fig. 8 Structure-based PDB searches. a . The PDB search criteria: (1) The distances (Å) between the atom C5 of the adenine ring and the atom CG of the Y710/H706 side chain. The tyrosine and histidine are from different subunits. (2) The distance between the phosphorous atom PG of the gamma-phosphate group and the atom CZ of a neighboring arginine. These distances were relaxed to ≤5 Å in the search. The two subunits of a dimer are designated as A and B. b–d . Nucleotide binding modes of the three closest search hits. The cases ( b , c ) are the same protein crystalized with ADP and AMPPNP 28 . In all three cases 28 , 29 , the nucleotide binds to the dimer interface, and interacts with the aromatic residues from different protein chains of the dimer. However, only one aromatic residue forms base stacking with the adenine ring. Details of the search data are shown in Source Data File 1 . Source data Extended Data Fig. 9 Sequence alignment of phosphoketolase from the non-bacteria groups. These include Fungi species (no. 4-no. 29) and one Archaea (no. 3) identified in our NCBI protein sequence search. The residue locations of the ATP-regulatory motif ( PW X 2 H a X 3 Y’R’ a X 7 H b X R b X 31 R c ) in the sequence are marked with stars. The bracket shows that K is as prevalent as R when included in the search for fungi species, as also included in Source Data File 2.

Source data Extended Data Fig. 10 Scheme of WT and Δxpk under high ATP or low ATP condition. a . When light-driving ATP is sufficient, Se XPK is inhibited in WT and carbon fixation via CBB is continued. Deletion of SeXPK has no effect. The fixed carbons are stored as glycogen. b . When ATP level is low under self-shaded condition, XPK in WT metabolizes sugar phosphates to interrupt carbon fixation. In Δxpk , CO 2 is continuously incorporated via CBB to form hexose-phosphates, followed by sucrose synthesis and excretion.

There are many kinds of HABs, caused by a variety of algal groups with different toxins. The HABs in fresh and marine waters are usually very different, but they overlap in low salinity estuaries (places where rivers meet the sea). The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal. States have rigorous monitoring programs to ensure that commercially harvested fish and shellfish are safe to eat. HABs have been reported in every U.S. coastal state, and their occurrence may be on the rise. HABs are a national concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems, but also the ""health"" of local and regional economies.

Ocean Fact What is red tide? Video All about HABs Explainer HAB Research Stressors & Mitigation Frequently Asked Questions What is a harmful algal bloom? Algae are a beneficial part of natural environments and only a few are harmful.Â Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Some HABs produce toxins that have harmful effects on people, fish, marine mammals, and birds. The toxins produced by algae vary by species and region, and impact organisms in different ways. HAB species and their impacts vary significantly from region to region.Â Information on the health effects of HABs on marine animals, shellfish, and people is available from NOAA , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . What is the difference between a marine and freshwater HAB? Algae are the bottom of the food chain in all natural environments. Only a few are harmful.Â HABs can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Cyanobacteria , a type of photosynthetic bacteria also known as blue-green algae, are often the cause of algal blooms in freshwater and occasionally in marine water. As the name implies, they often (but not always) discolor the water bright green or blue green and form scum. A combination of environmental factors such as the presence of nutrients, warm temperatures, and lots of light encourage the natural increase in the numbers of cyanobacteria.Â Cyanobacteria HABs produce multiple toxins , including liver, nerve, and skin toxins, which can affect human and animal health. The most common cyanobacterial HAB toxins in the U.S. are microcystins, a group of liver toxins that can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, and mortality in pets, livestock, and wildlife. Alternatively, dinoflagellates and diatoms , different types of phytoplankton, are the most common HAB species in marine and brackish waters, including estuaries. Some of these blooms discolor the water different shades of red and brown and a few are bioluminescent.Â While the causes of individual marine HAB events have been shown to vary across years and locations, nutrient inputs may help sustain an event once the bloom reaches the shoreline. Some dinoflagellate species produce cysts, which are dormant “seeds” that are created during a bloom and are capable of living through harsh conditions. When favorable conditions resume, the cysts rupture, germinate, and populate the water column with a new generation of photosynthetically active cells primed for another bloom. Marine HABs produce toxins that may result in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, , diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera poisoning in fish, respiratory irritation in humans, or shellfish contamination. Some marine HABs also affect the central nervous system of fish, marine mammals, and birds. In both marine and freshwater environments, there are also HABs that do not directly affect humans but can kill fish, shellfish, and invertebrates or cause other ecosystem impacts such as shading submerged aquatic vegetation, smothering corals, or causing oxygen in the water to be depleted .Â For example, fish kills in freshwater may be caused by golden algae and brown tides , which result in many ecosystem impacts in estuaries. Is the HAB in my state the same as in Florida? The varieties of HABs, the toxins they produce, and the impacts they cause vary significantly from region to region. HABs are a multi-faceted threat with different environmental factors leading to the prevalence of different algal species, as well as the presence or absence of toxins. These factors include physical and biological conditions that influence HAB growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Learn more about specific HABs and available resources where you live from our regional HAB pages. How does NOAA forecast harmful algal blooms? NOAA's Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring System provides products for the Gulf of Maine , Lake Erie , and in Florida , Louisiana , and North Carolina . These monitoring products identify the location and extent of the bloom and rely on satellite imagery, field observations, models, public health reports, and buoy data to provide information on bloom events. Additionally, NOAA’s Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System bulletins and condition reports are available for the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Erie . The HAB forecasts and bulletins alert coastal managers to blooms before they result in serious damage and identify the risk of respiratory irritation in a county over the coming days. Short-term (once or twice weekly) forecasts identify which blooms are potentially harmful, where they are, how big they are, and where they're likely headed. Longer-term, seasonal forecasts predict the severity of HABs for the bloom season in a particular region. The bulletins provide decision-makers with a more in-depth analysis of the current bloom location and reported impacts, as well as forecasts of potential development, intensification, transport, and associated impacts of blooms. NOAA is funding researchers and local agencies in other regions of the U.S. to develop new forecasting and monitoring systems, including the Gulf of Maine , the central and southern California coast , and the Pacific Northwest . What areas are prone to harmful algal blooms? HABs occur in all U.S. waters . According to the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, NOAA has purview over HABs in marine environments, whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is focused on freshwater HABs that occur in all U.S. states. NOAA and EPA share authority over the Great Lakes with regards to HABs. Visit the NOAA Ecological Forecasting page to see ecological forecasting ""hotspots"" in marine/coastal environments or the Great Lakes, or select a region at the top of this page to learn more about region-specific resources. How long does a HAB event last? The duration of a HAB event depends on a number of factors and is not possible to predict in advance. For example, red tides in Florida can last as little as a few weeks to longer than a year. They may even subside and then reoccur. The duration of a bloom depends on physical and biological conditions that influence its growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Can a HAB be stopped? HABs can’t be stopped but control methods are currently being investigated. In the early 2000s, NOAA funded studies to test the use of clays to control red tides. Since that time, different types of clays have been developed that have fewer environmental effects and are in the initial phases of testing. This method involves a modified clay mineral that, when dispersed into the ocean surface, binds with red tide cells and the toxins they produce and carries them to the seafloor where they are eventually buried. Additionally, many other control methods are being tested. For example, engineers at Nano Air Bubble Aeration System Technology are researching an environmentally sustainable method to eliminate harmful freshwater algae and their toxins. The method uses nanobubbles â bubbles smaller than the width of a single human hair â to aerate water bodies and create ozone that helps dissolve harmful algae. Another instance is the examination of a chemical control agent isolated from a bacteria species that may provide a mechanism for halting the growth of certain types of toxic dinoflagellate harmful algal blooms while having no negative impacts on other organisms . How do you find out if it is safe to go to the beach or harvest shellfish during a HAB? Some beach areas may be more affected than others during a HAB event. Check local health departments and local governmental websites for the latest information about HAB events and safety. If you have a chronic respiratory condition, avoid beaches during HAB events. What do you do if you see injured, sick, stranded, or dead wildlife? Do not touch or try to rescue any animal that appears to be impacted by HABs. Reporting sick, injured, entangled, stranded, or dead animal is the best way to make sure professional responders and scientists know about it and can take appropriate action. Numerous organizations around the country are trained and ready to respond. If you see a sick, injured, stranded, or dead marine mammal or sea turtle, immediately contact your local stranding network. Visit the NOAA Fisheries website and follow the instructions. You can also use Fisheries’ Dolphin and Whale 911 app for Apple devices to report a stranded marine mammal. How can harmful algal blooms affect pets? Because of their behavior, dogs are much more susceptible than humans to cyanobacterial poisoning, which is typically found in freshwater bodies and some estuaries. When toxins are present, dogs can be exposed to toxins by drinking the water, by eating washed up mats or scum of toxic cyanobacteria, and by having skin contact with water. Dogs are often attracted to algal scum odors. After leaving the water, dogs can also be poisoned by grooming their fur and paws. If your dog has been swimming in a lake or pond with a suspected or identified HAB, closely monitor your dog for any signs of cyanobacterial poisoning and be sure to rinse the dog with clean water. Signs of poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to a few hours after exposure, depending on the size of the dog, the type of toxin, the toxin concentration, and how much toxin the dog has ingested. In severe cases, dogs can show signs of cyanobacterial poisoning within a few minutes and can die within an hour of toxin exposure. NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science provides additional information and resources for protecting your dog from HABs . Although there is not a large body of data, there are reports of other HABs affecting dogs. As a precaution, do not allow dogs to swim in discolored water, roll in or eat algae piled on the beach, or run and play on beaches where humans are experiencing respiratory problems.

Cyanobacteria, also referred to as blue-green algae, are microscopic bacteria that live in all types of bodies of water. Cyanobacteria may occur as single cells, threads or as colonies. The two most common facts are phosphorous and nitrogen in water bodies, which are found in fertilizers and human and animal waste. ""Certain environmental conditions, such as warm weather, sunlight, excess nutrients, and stagnant/slow-moving waters help cyanobacteria grow faster,"" according to the state's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) . When do Massachusetts cities and towns have to issue an advisory for cyanobacteria? The state's Department of Public Health (DPH) recommends municipalities issue an advisor if a visible scum is present, the algal cell count exceeds 70,000 cells per milliliter of water, and if certain toxins produced by cyanobacteria are above a certain threshold set by the state. In 2022, DPH was aware of 55 cyanoHAB advisories – 30 that were recommended by DPH and 25 issued by local health departments. Where are there cyanobacteria blooms so far in 2023 Massachusetts' Department of Public Health maintains a list of cyanobacteria bloom advisories. As of June 14, there were six advisories, which were Lake Waushakum in Framingham/Ashland, Mystic Lake in Barnstable, Mashpee-Wakeby Pond in Mashpee, Miacomet Pond in Nantucket, Scokes Pond in Plymouth and Dean Park Pond in Shrewsbury. DPH regularly updates the list but also advises that when in doubt, stay out of the water. Growth and Develoment: What's next for Natick Mall, shoppers after Wegmans closes later this year? The advisory for Lake Waushakum in Framingham was issued on May 30, according to a city spokesperson. The Department of Public Health will conduct two tests of the water after seven consecutive days of no visible evidence of algae to determine if the advisory can be removed. The water was tested on June 16 and showed amounts below regulation levels. The next test will be performed on June 20. If the second test also is below state regulations, the advisory will be able to be removed, according to a city spokesperson. Are cyanobacteria blooms harmful? Cyanobacteria have the ability to produce toxins called cyanotoxins. When an increase in cyanobacteria population happens, it forms what the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) calls harmful algal blooms (HABs). ""It often results in the waterbody turning bright green or blue-green, and forms a surface scum or a discoloration of the water column,"" according to the DEP's website. According to MassDEP, health concerns depend on the type of cyanobacteria, the route of exposure and the amount of toxins present. ""Ingestion is the primary concern since ingesting small amounts of cyanobacteria or cyanotoxin can cause gastrointestinal symptoms while larger amounts may cause liver or neurological damage,"" the department's website states. In addition, contact with the water spray containing cyanobacteria can cause asthma-like symptoms and can cause skin or eye irritation. Small children and pets are most susceptible to cyanotoxin effects, according the MassDEP . Will cyanobacteria hurt my pets and other animals? There have been documented reports of dog, bird and livestock deaths resulting from consumption of surface water sources with cyanobacteria blooms. Children and pets are more likely to get bacteria in their mouths. Dogs can become very ill and even die from licking cyanobacteria off their fur, according to the DPH. Looking for somethig to read? He took notes during his final visits with his parents. Now Holliston man has a book What can be done about cyanobacteria blooms? Not many options exist for eliminating a bloom, as chemical treatments such as algaecides are not recommended by the DPH. Although not much can be done to eliminate a bloom, many things can be done to prevent blooms. These include maintaining septic systems and storm drains, reducing fertilizer, picking up after pets and not feeding ducks or geese. What should I do if I suspect cyanobacteria in the water If a potential cyanobacteria bloom is at a recreational waterbody, contact the local health department. If the bloom is at a drinking water reservoir, contact the local water department and MassDEP. DPH provides support for local health departments and MassDEP is responsible for blooms found in public water supplies. If contact with cyanobacteria occurs, DPH recommends washing yourself and your pet with tap or bottled water and recommends calling doctor or veterinarian if cyanobacteria water is ingested.

Cyanobacteria on Cape Cod: What it is, how it affects us, and what’s being done to protect public health. Published on: June 27, 2023 Lately, there’s been quite a bit of discussion about cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae or Harmful Algae Blooms) in Cape Cod’s ponds, leading some to wonder whether it’s safe for people and/or their pets to swim. The term “pollution” has popped up on social media forums as well as in local news media, generating the impression that the region’s water bodies are tainted and therefore unsafe for humans and animals. This perception is not entirely unfounded, nor is it 100% accurate. It’s…complicated. Local public health officials recognize that cyanobacteria is an area of concern for residents and visitors alike, and have been meeting regularly to determine a proactive multi-agency approach for dealing with this complex issue, which requires attention from both a public health and environmental standpoint. Understanding the Problem Cyanobacteria is not pollution, per se. It’s a natural phenomenon that can occur in healthy ecosystems. Typically however, its potential for overgrowth is kept in check by a balance of several different factors, one of which is nutrient availability. All animals and plants require nutrients to grow and thrive, but if an external force makes nutrients either scarce or overabundant–the balance is disrupted and things can start to go wrong. Here on Cape Cod, human activities–from fertilization to faulty septic systems–have introduced an overabundance of nutrients into the environment, which leads to an ecologically unhealthy condition called eutrophication (the process by which a water body becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients such as phosphates and nitrogen). The greater the nutrient availability, the more fuel for cyanobacteria (and other undesirable plant life) to grow and thrive. Global warming also plays a key role with warmer pond temperatures favoring cyanobacteria. Terminology is Key When discussing cyanobacteria, we often hear the term used interchangeably with harmful algae blooms (HABs) and toxic algae. There is, however, an important distinction to make: not all cyanobacteria is toxin producing. So while an overgrowth of cyanobacteria may have some aesthetic impact on a particular water body or even environmental implications, it may not be harmful to people and their pets. That said, a visual assessment alone is not enough to make a determination between toxic and non-toxic, so further analysis is required. And if you don’t know either way, it’s always best to conclude the following: WHEN IN DOUBT, STAY OUT. From the 2022 MA DPH Guidance for Cyanobacteria in Recreational Waters : “Cyanobacteria and their associated cyanotoxins pose a risk to human and animal health. Cyanotoxins are of primary concern due to the potential for causing serious health effects. Because there are over 100 types of cyanotoxins, testing for them all is not possible or practical. Therefore, the health protective approach is to assume that cyanotoxins are present in any algae bloom.” Understanding the Players There are two disciplines interested in developing a strategy for dealing with cyanobacteria blooms in our region. Public health officials and environmental groups. There is an economical factor as well; algae-filled water bodies are not ideal for homeowners, home buyers and visitors who seek enjoyment of the region’s natural resources. Because Barnstable County is a public health entity that supports the local boards of health in every one of Cape Cod’s 15 towns, our focus is the primary directive of public health: to promote and protect the health of our communities. At the same time, we are working alongside our colleagues in the environmental field to support their mission to protect our sensitive ecosystem, the health of which is closely tied to the well-being of our local economy. It’s important to understand that remediation–the act of reducing or solving environmental damage–differs distinctly from prevention–the act of stopping something from happening. Public health fficials are interested in preventing injury or harm from known health hazards, while environmental officials are interested in remediating or reducing impact to our sensitive ecosystem. While the two approaches can be different, both have equal stake in bringing awareness to the public. A Collaborative Approach Barnstable County has partnered with the Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), a local non-profit environmental organization, to proactively monitor Cape Cod’s ponds for cyanobacteria and, more specifically, the toxins they sometimes produce. APCC will collect pond water samples and use a predictive methodology called CyanoCasting. While this method provides useful information regarding cyanobacteria presence and abundance, it does not provide data regarding the existence or quantity of harmful toxins. If APCC’s team, through the use of the above-described CyanoCasting method, determines that additional confirmatory toxin testing is warranted, the Barnstable County Water Quality Lab will then perform toxin analysis via Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Approved Method 546 for Surface Water Sampling. If toxins are found to be present in an amount considered to be harmful to humans and pets, an advisory will be issued by the local board of health to make the public aware that swimming could pose a risk of illness. For more specifics regarding the particulars of the monitoring program, please visit APCC’s cyanobacteria monitoring web page . The Law (or Lack Thereof) It is important to note that currently, no regulatory framework exists for the collection and analysis of cyanobacteria. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health provides guidelines and recommendations, both of which APCC and the Barnstable County Water Quality lab adhere to, but there is no regulation or law that mandates these monitoring efforts. This is unlike Barnstable County’s existing Bathing Beach Monitoring Program, which was established in 2002 to help Cape Cod’s communities comply with Massachusetts Bathing Beach Regulations 105 CMR 445.00 , that require the weekly monitoring of fecal bacteria levels in marine and fresh recreational waters. Any cyanobacteria monitoring strategies including site selection, sampling frequency, etc., that are conducted in accordance with the collaborative agreement between APCC and Barnstable County, are solely at the discretion of the two organizations and contributing local boards of health. Look Out for our Signs! Our beach monitoring signs will be posted at over 350 swimming beaches across Cape Cod’s 15 towns. We monitor public (town beaches) and semi-public (association) beaches for fecal bacteria . We do not monitor private beaches. The sign includes information about the beach operator and a phone number to contact if you have questions or concerns. If our testing shows levels of fecal bacteria levels higher than the acceptable limit, the middle portion of the sign that reads “fecal bacteria levels found to be within acceptable limits” will be covered with a decal that reads “NO SWIMMING! Swimming may cause illness”. The decal will be removed when re-testing shows that are bacteria levels are within acceptable levels. While the signs do not directly address cyanobacteria, a QR code at the bottom of the sign takes the user to our website for further information, including links to APCC’s cyanobacteria monitoring page.

(Jesse Costa/WBUR) Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from WBUR's daily morning newsletter, WBUR Today. If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, sign up here . We finally got a good run of beach-worthy weather this summer, but the heat doesn’t make for great swimming conditions everywhere. You’re probably familiar with the term cyanobacteria by now. Also known as blue-green algae, the toxic blooms have become a regular summertime occurrence in Massachusetts. While the heat may make any local pond alluring, WBUR’s Paula Moura reports the warm weather is contributing to a rise in cyanobacteria blooms across the state , from Arlington to Nantucket to Shrewsbury. An upward trend: The state has issued cyanobacteria advisories for nine ponds this month. That’s a record, topping the previous monthly record of eight set just this past June, according to The Boston Globe . Moura reports climate change is expected to only further fuel this rising trend. Not only does heavy rain carry more stormwater runoff into water bodies , but cyanobacteria grows faster in warm water. “Warmer water coupled with the sunlight in the summer is just a perfect breeding ground for them,” said Lucia Ross, the CMO of Bluegreen Water Technologies, a company that works to reduce cyanobacteria. What’s the worst that could happen? Swimming in water with blue-green algae (and incidentally ingesting it) can lead to stomach trouble, headaches, fever and fatigue. It’s also really not great for pets, which can die if they drink too much of it . How to spot it? State officials stress their advisory list is not exhaustive, so there could be ponds or rivers they’re missing. But as the nickname implies, you’ll notice a green scum on the water’s surface that looks like green paint (similar to the color of pea soup, yet less tasty). Go deeper: Read WBUR’s Barbara Moran’s explainer of everything you need to know about blue-green algae . The future of the birthing center at Leominster Hospital will be in the spotlight tonight. The state Department of Public Health is holding a public hearing on UMass Memorial Health’s plan to close the center in September due to severe staffing shortages and declining patients. WBUR’s Priyanka Dayal McCluskey reports the decision has triggered a backlash from local nurses and community advocates, who say the closure will force patients in the area to travel too far for maternity services. About 500 births occurred at the maternity ward last year. “Babies’ lives are going to be put at risk,” said Eladia Romero, a leader of the Community United to Save Our Birthing Center coalition. “We should be able to have access to this essential service, which is labor and delivery.” Reality check: While UMass Memorial’s plan must be reviewed by the state , regulators can’t stop hospitals from closing services. The most they can do is require the hospital to submit a plan for preserving access to essential services in the area. Boston City Councilor Michael Flaherty thinks his colleague Kendra Lara should join him on the way out the City Hall door this year. Flaherty told NBC 10 Boston this weekend he thinks Lara should resign over the criminal charges she faces for crashing a car last month while driving without a license or registration. “The behavior is one of a habitual scofflaw,” Flaherty said. “To go 10 years without a license isn’t a mistake; it’s the middle finger, frankly.” Lara has apologized for the crash and says she does not plan to resign. The first-term District 6 councilor is facing two opponents in her bid for reelection this fall, per the Boston Herald : IT specialist William King and lawyer Benjamin Weber.

NH News By Degrees: Covering Climate Change NH on track to set new record for cyanobacteria blooms New Hampshire Public Radio | 
                    By Adriana Martinez-Smiley Published July 31, 2023 at 2:51 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Picasa / Courtesy of New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services An algal bloom in a body of water This year is projected to see the highest number of cyanobacteria blooms ever reported in New Hampshire, according to data from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. Kate Hastings, who monitors cyanobacteria blooms for the state, said cyanobacteria has already passed a number of other records this summer alone. “We'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but we have broken the record for the total number of advisories recorded within each month so far this year,” she said. “In addition to setting the record for the most advisories ever issued within one month. That was set this past June.” Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found in many aquatic environments , including New Hampshire’s lakes. They are known for taking advantage of ecosystem irregularities ; when the conditions are right, cyanobacteria can spread across the surface of a pond or lake, covering the water with a green, algae-like film. While the increase in reports can partially be attributed to increased awareness, Hastings said, there are two additional contributing factors: an uptick in development around water bodies and the impact of climate change. That includes the severe rainstorms we’ve been seeing this summer. “These huge storms bring in big pulses of nutrients all at once, instead of a more regular input of lower nutrients spread out over the duration of the summer,” said Hastings. Other changes, such as less ice cover on many lakes in winter and higher temperatures than normal, can also spur blooms. Cyanobacteria in high densities have the potential to release cyanotoxins . Exposure to these toxins can cause mild to severe health side effects in humans and pets. The state environmental agency recommends avoiding bodies of water that have active cyanobacteria advisories or alerts. Hastings said people should report any suspicious discoloration in local lakes and ponds to the state environmental agency so they can perform testing. You can find reference photos of cyanobacteria blooms, as well as a reporting form here . To view active cyanobacteria alerts and advisories, visit the state’s Healthy Swimming Mapper .

This is in response to a water sample taken on November 29, 2023. The public should exercise caution in and around Blanton Lake . Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Wash your skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with algae or discolored or smelly Keep pets away from the Waters where there are algae blooms are not safe for animals. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water when algae blooms are present. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish well. Do not eat shellfish in waters with algae. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals. For additional information on potential health effects of algal blooms, visit floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/aquatic-toxins. Find current information about Florida’s water quality status and public health notifications for harmful algal blooms and beach conditions by visiting ProtectingFloridaTogether.gov . Protecting Florida Together is the state’s joint effort to provide statewide water quality information to prioritize environmental transparency and commitment to action .

(Courtesy of Idaho Fish and Game) Idahoans should use caution when recreating in or near the Island Park Reservoir after high amounts of toxin-producing cyanobacteria was recently found in water samples there, according to a press release from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. FOR MORE INFORMATION Visit the Idaho Recreational Water Health Advisories tab at the Get Healthy Idaho website for advisories and sampled locations at water bodies throughout Idaho. The toxins can be harmful to people, pets and livestock. The health department works closely with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality to identify, respond to, and monitor cyanobacteria harmful algal blooms, known as cyanoHABs. When recreating near or in Island Park Reservoir, take the following precautions while the advisory is in effect: Avoid swimming, wading or other contact with the water. Take extra care to ensure children do not drink or get water on them. Ensure pets and livestock do not drink or go into the water. If they have contact with the water, clean skin, hide or fur with clean water right away. Do not drink or cook with the water. Boiling or filtering the water does not remove the toxins and can increase the risk of becoming sick. Wash hands thoroughly in clean water after handling fish or objects from the water. If you choose to eat fish from the water, clean and wash fish thoroughly in uncontaminated water. Filet the fish, and remove all fat, skin and internal organs before cooking. Cyanotoxins can build up in fish, and the risk to people is unknown. Watch for symptoms. If you touch or swim in the water or inhale water droplets, you might experience a rash, hives, red eyes, wheezing, coughing or shortness of breath. If you swallow the water, you might have stomach pain, diarrhea or vomiting. You might have a headache, muscle weakness or dizziness. If your liver is damaged, your skin might turn yellow, and you will have dark urine. If you think you might be sick from cyanotoxin, consult your health care provider or call the poison center at 1-800-222-1222. In addition, notify [email protected] . Monitor media reports and DHW’s website for health advisories. Summer heat can cause dangerous conditions, harmful algal blooms in Idaho’s rivers and lakes Cyanobacteria are a natural part of Idaho’s water bodies, according to the health department. The amount of bacteria usually increases rapidly when the temperature of the water rises and there are nutrients for the bacteria to grow. The blooming can release toxic chemical compounds, called cyanotoxins, into the water. Blooms don’t all look the same. They may look like mats, foam, spilled paint, or surface scum, and have a foul odor. Algal mats can be out of sight on the bottom of the water body. Pets, livestock and wildlife can get sick or die within minutes to days after cyanotoxin exposure. Dogs can become sick first because they are more likely to swim in or drink contaminated water or lick contaminated water or bloom material from their fur. If your pets or livestock have been in the water, immediately wash them with clean water to keep them from licking cyanobacteria off their bodies. Seek veterinary care immediately if your pets or livestock seem sick after going in or drinking the water.

Comments are due by October 30, 2023 and may be emailed to mattamuskeet@fws.gov or mailed to Mattamuskeet NWR, 85 Mattamuskeet Rd, Swan Quarter, NC 27885. Over the past decade, Lake Mattamuskeet has experienced declines in water quality, transitioning from a lake dominated by dense grass beds to one dominated by microscopic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria. Fueled by excess nutrients, these cyanobacteria, along with the high levels of suspended sediments in the lake, block sunlight and prevent growth of submerged grasses that are very beneficial to fish and wildlife. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was approached by the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences and BlueGreen Water Technologies who had identified Lake Mattamuskeet as a potential study site for a trial treatment of cyanobacteria. After several discussions and field visits with the project team and state partners, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service produced a draft Environmental Assessment for the proposed cyanobacteria treatment on Lake Mattamuskeet. In an effort to provide more concise information to the public, USFWS has developed an information sheet regarding the proposed treatment. Proposed Cyanobacteria Treatment Information Sheet The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of this draft Environmental Assessment and is seeking comments from the public on the proposed action.  Copies can be accessed at the refuge office or online at the button below. Draft Environmental Assessment Comments are due by October 30, 2023 and may be emailed to mattamuskeet@fws.gov or mailed to Mattamuskeet NWR, 85 Mattamuskeet Rd, Swan Quarter, NC 27885.

It has been hypothesized that the excreted nitrite represents excess nitrogen that cannot be further assimilated due to the missing carbon, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identified a protein that interacts with nitrite reductase, regulates nitrogen metabolism and promotes nitrite excretion. The protein, which we named NirP1, is encoded by an unannotated gene that is upregulated under low carbon conditions and controlled by transcription factor NtcA, a central regulator of nitrogen homeostasis. Ectopic overexpression of nirP1 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 resulted in a chlorotic phenotype, delayed growth, severe changes in amino acid pools, and nitrite excretion. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that NirP1 interacts with nitrite reductase, a central enzyme in the assimilation of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite. Our results reveal that NirP1 is widely conserved in cyanobacteria and plays a crucial role in the coordination of C/N primary metabolism by targeting nitrite reductase.

Other cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 ( Synechococcus 7942) or Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ( Synechocystis 6803), have become model species for the CO 2 -neutral production of chemical feedstock and biotechnological processes driven by photosynthesis 4 , 5 . The two most relevant nutrients for cyanobacteria are inorganic carbon (C i ) and N. Most cyanobacteria assimilate combined inorganic N forms, such as ammonium (NH 4 + ), nitrate (NO 3 − ), nitrite (NO 2 − ), and urea; in addition, diazotrophic species can utilize N 2 gas. Surprisingly, several different cyanobacteria excrete nitrite under photoautotrophic growth conditions. Certain isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus were reported to release up to 30% of their N uptake as extracellular nitrite when grown on nitrate 6 . The released nitrite is cross-fed by other microbes that cannot consume nitrate or produce nitrite. Moreover, it was demonstrated that cooccurring microbes could be beneficial for Prochlorococcus 7 , 8 . In Synechococcus 7942, as well, approximately 30% of the produced nitrite were excreted in shifts to low C i (LC) conditions, while no nitrite was excreted under high C i (HC) conditions 9 . The coordination of C and N metabolism is regulated by several transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. An acute N scarcity is sensed by two central regulators of N assimilation in cyanobacteria, P II and NtcA, by binding the key metabolite 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . 2-OG connects C and N metabolism because it represents the main precursor for ammonia assimilation through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle in cyanobacteria and plants. Initially, GS incorporates ammonia into glutamate, thereby producing glutamine. The amino group from glutamine is then transferred onto 2-OG by GOGAT, yielding two glutamate molecules. As a consequence, the intracellular level of 2-OG starts to increase once these reactions slow down due to insufficient N supply; thus, 2-OG is an excellent indicator of the N status 15 . Binding of 2-OG stimulates the activity of NtcA, the main transcriptional regulator of genes encoding proteins involved in N assimilation 10 , 11 . Depending on the 2-OG level, the P II interaction protein X (PipX) switches from binding to P II to interacting with NtcA, further enhancing the binding affinity of this complex to target promoters 12 , 14 . In Synechocystis 6803, NtcA directly activates 51 genes, including transporters for N sources and GS/GOGAT, and represses 28 other genes after 4 h of N starvation 16 . In addition to transcription factors, multiple different proteins have been identified that interact with these factors or the involved enzymes and govern their functions directly. Archetypical examples for these proteins are the inhibitory factors IF7 and IF17, as their binding to GS leads to the inactivation of the enzyme when N supply exceeds demand 17 . The P II -interacting regulator of arginine synthesis (PirA) regulates the flux into the ornithine-ammonia cycle and therefore arginine synthesis 18 , 19 , while the P II -interacting regulator of C metabolism (PirC) functions as an inhibitor of 2,3-phosphoglycerate–independent phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), the enzyme that shifts newly fixed CO 2 toward lower glycolysis 20 . PirC becomes sequestered by P II at low 2-OG levels and released for PGAM inhibition at high 2-OG levels and therefore connects the control of C and N assimilatory pathways in a particular way 20 . We have previously analyzed the primary transcriptomes of Synechocystis 6803 and the closely related strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 21 , 22 , 23 . Based on these analyses, many more genes encoding unknown small, potentially regulatory proteins were computationally predicted. Experiments using a 3xFLAG epitope tag fused in-frame to the 3′ ends of the respective reading frames validated five of these to encode small proteins 24 . Subsequent experimental analyses using coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) demonstrated that one of these small proteins, NblD, facilitates the degradation of phycobilisomes under N starvation conditions 25 , while another one, called AtpΘ, is an inhibitor of the ATP synthase back reaction under low energy conditions 26 . Collectively, these findings suggest that cyanobacteria use a broad collection of small protein modulators to regulate metabolism according to external clues. Here, we report a small, regulatory protein involved in the control of N assimilation in cyanobacteria in an unexpected way. This protein is 81 amino acids long in Synechocystis 6803, and its expression is upregulated following shifts from HC to LC conditions and downregulated upon N downshifts. Co-IP experiments identified the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR) as the primary target of this protein. Following this lead further, we characterize the protein as a regulatory factor in the primary assimilation of N from nitrate/nitrite. Based on the observed phenotype, we named the regulatory protein NirP1, for nitrite reductase interacting protein 1. Results The ncr1071 transcript exhibits coding potential The NtcA regulon in Synechocystis 6803 was reported to comprise 79 genes, including eight non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 16 . One of these ncRNAs, with the transcript ID ncr1071, was strongly downregulated upon N step-down 16 . This transcript extends from position 2215954 to 2217039 on the forward strand of the Synechocystis 6803 chromosome (GenBank accession no. NC_000911) and was assigned to the transcriptional unit (TU) 2296 21 . When 10 different cultivation conditions were compared, TU2296 was found to be maximally transcribed under LC, while it was strongly repressed under N starvation conditions 21 . TU2296 overlaps the coding sequence of the sll1864 gene encoding a potential chloride channel protein on the reverse strand by more than 500 nt (Fig. 1a ). Fig. 1: Genomic location and expression of nirP1 in Synechocystis 6803. a The transcriptional unit TU2296 encompassing the coding sequence of nirP1 ( ncr1071 ) overlaps gene sll1864 annotated as encoding a chloride ion channel protein. Plot at low CO 2 (blue) versus N starvation (green). Transcriptional units (TUs) are indicated according to the previous annotation of the transcriptome and genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites 21 .

The last and most conserved part of Synechocystis 6803 NirP1 from position 25 to the end is shown. The cysteine and tryptophan residues conserved in all 485 potential homologs (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) are marked by arrows. The alignment was generated using ClustalW and visualized by Jalview. c Time course of nirp1 mRNA accumulation in Synechocystis 6803 after cells precultivated in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (HC) for 3 h were shifted to medium without a source of C i (LC). The nirp1 transcript was detected by a 32 P-labeled single-stranded RNA probe. The membrane was rehybridized to a 5S rRNA probe as a loading control. The RiboRuler Low Range RNA ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as the molecular mass standard. The relative amount of nirp1 transcript normalized to the 5S rRNA is shown in the bar chart. The HC condition was set to 1, and all other signals were normalized to the HC condition. Two independent biological replicates were used and averaged. d NirP1 was detected in the presence or absence of C i by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum against tagged NirP1 under the control of its native promoter in two biological replicates (R1 and R2). The wild type was used as a control. Cultures were grown in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (+), washed, and cultivated in carbonate-free medium (-) for 24 h. Prestained PageRuler TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a molecular mass marker. The blot has been performed in two independent experiments ( n = 2). e NirP1 structure predicted by AlphaFold 31 , 32 for the complete Synechocystis NirP1 protein, indicating the presence of four beta folds in the most conserved part. The four totally conserved amino acids as well as Cys27 and Cys81 are highlighted, tryptophan is shown in magenta, and cysteine in yellow. The Met1 residue is also indicated for orientation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Upon closer inspection, we discovered that the first segment of this transcript exhibits potential to encode an 81-residue protein with a calculated IEP of 4.59 and a molecular mass of 9.18 kDa. Evidence for the possible existence of this protein was provided independently by mass spectrometry data from a deep proteogenomics dataset 27 . Based on the results below, we named this protein NirP1, for nitrite reductase interacting protein 1. Database searches identified 485 potential homologs of nirP1 (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) in species belonging to all morphological subsections of cyanobacteria 28 , including the well-studied model Synechococcus 7942, heterocyst-forming diazotrophic species and Section V strains, such as Fischerella . Homologous genes were detected in marine species with deviating pigmentation, such as Acaryochloris marina and Halomicronema hongdechloris , but not in Prochlorococcus and not in the majority of marine picoplanktonic Synechococcus strains. Homologs were also not detected in the genomes of diatom-associated symbionts Calothrix rhizosoleniae and Richelia intracellularis nor in the endosymbiont chromatophore genomes of photosynthetic Paulinella species or the UCYN-A Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa endosymbionts, which can perform N 2 fixation but lack photosystem II and phycobilisomes 29 , 30 . These data suggest that homologs of nirP1 were advantageous but not essential for free-living cyanobacteria with very different physiologies. The vast majority of the 485 putative homologs identified in this work (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) are between 76 and 86 aa in length. The alignment of selected NirP1 homologs highlights the conservation in the last ~50 aa and the presence of a centrally located, absolutely conserved single cysteine and three tryptophan residues (Fig. 1b ). To verify the inducibility of nirP1 transcription by shifts to LC conditions, cultures of Synechocystis 6803 precultivated in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (high C i , HC) were centrifuged and resuspended in medium lacking any source of C i . In Northern blot analysis, samples taken over 24 h showed a single signal of approximately 580 nt (Fig. 1c ) matching the length from the transcription start site (TSS) to the steep decline in the number of reads approximately 80 nt after the nirP1 stop codon (Fig. 1a ). A strong signal was obtained 1 h after the shift, with a slightly decreasing intensity at the later time points and increasing again at the 24 h sampling point. At a weaker intensity, the nirP1 mRNA was also detectable in the sample from high C i (HC)-grown cells. To directly validate the presence of NirP1, strains expressing NirP1 −3xFLAG fusions were constructed (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‒PAGE) and Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum. Two signals of slightly different molecular masses were detected. The calculated molecular mass of ~12 kDa for the prominent signal in the samples from HC-grown cultures was consistent with the sum of the calculated molecular masses of 9.18 kDa for the monomeric NirP1 and 2.86 kDa for the 3xFLAG tag (Fig. 1d ). After the shift to LC conditions, a band migrating with a ~1.5 kDa larger molecular mass became more intense, possibly indicating a post-translational modification. No FLAG-tagged NirP1 was detected in the wild-type strain used as a control. From these experiments, we conclude that TU2296 encodes the small protein NirP1 and that nirP1 transcription responds to shifts in C i supply. To generate a model for the NirP1 structure, we used AlphaFold 31 , 32 , which modeled NirP1 as a monomer and predicted four beta folds in the most conserved part of the protein. No structure was predicted for the N-terminal section of the protein, consistent with a lack of sequence conservation (Fig. 1b ). Two cysteine residues (Cys27 and Cys81) in Synechocystis 6803 NirP1 were predicted to be in close proximity to each other, potentially forming a disulfide bond (Fig. 1e ), whereas a third, highly conserved Cys55 was found between two beta strands in the folded part, exposed to the outside. However, no functional domains could be predicted based on the primary sequence or modeled structure. Two transcription factors are involved in the regulation of nirP1 expression Based on literature reports 16 , we speculated that nirP1 expression could be negatively regulated by NtcA binding to a conserved binding site over the TSS. Moreover, we observed a tandem repeat element located further upstream consisting of two octameric repeats TTTGT(T/C)AA separated by a dinucleotide. In promoter sequence analyses of 456 nirP1 homologs (Supplementary Dataset 2 ), the NtcA-binding motif was present and conserved in 435 cases. The tandem repeat was found in 135 homologs (Supplementary Dataset 2 ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). To investigate the possible regulation through these sequence elements, the promoter of nirP1 (P nirP1 ; from −70 to +30, TSS at +1) was engineered in a transcriptional fusion to drive the luxAB reporter genes. We used the native P nirP1 sequence or promoter variants with mutated, likely relevant nucleotides either in the NtcA-binding site (P NtcA-Mut ) or in the upstream promoter element (P Repeat-Mut ; Fig. 2a ). Fig. 2: NirP1 expression is mediated through a C i -sensitive promoter and the transcription factor NtcA. a Top: Native P nirP1 promoter sequence from position −70 to +30 (TSS at +1) used in a bioluminescence reporter strain harboring a P nirP1 - luxAB transcriptional fusion. Functional promoter elements are colored blue. The previously determined 21 transcription start site (TSS) is indicated. Middle row: Mutated nucleotides in the NtcA-binding site yielding promoter P NtcA-Mut are colored red. Bottom: Mutated nucleotides in the repeat motif yielding promoter P Repeat-Mut are colored red. Both mutated promoters were fused to luxAB and introduced into a neutral site in parallel with the P nirP1 - luxAB construct. b Bioluminescence of the Synechocystis 6803 P nirP1 - luxAB , P NtcA-Mut - luxAB reporter, and P Repeat-Mut - luxAB strains and a promoter-less (P less ) negative control. Cells were grown under HC conditions (BG11 supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 ) for 2 h and transferred to BG11 medium without a CO 2 source to induce LC conditions for 24 h. c The strains were cultivated in BG11 (-N), and the chlorotic cultures were transferred back to standard BG11 (17.6 mM NaNO 3 ) medium to start the recovery process seven days after N starvation was initiated. d Strains were cultivated in standard BG11 and then 10 mM NH 4 Cl was added for 24 h. Bioluminescence data are presented as the means ± SDs of 3 independent measurements with three biological replicates each ( n = 9). Significance was calculated with a two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t -test; * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001) between the strains at corresponding time points (details of statistical analysis Supplementary Fig. S3 and in Supplementary Dataset 3 ). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image In strains P nirP1 and P NtcA-Mut , transcription was activated 1 h after a shift to medium lacking C i , followed by a decrease and a light increase again at the later time points (Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The increase at 24 h was not as pronounced as in the Northern blot (Fig. 1c ), pointing at the possible involvement of post-transcriptional regulation. This activation was significantly higher in the P NtcA-Mut strains with the mutated NtcA-binding site. This effect was even more pronounced after a shift to N starvation conditions (Fig. 2c ; Supplementary Dataset 3 ). These results indicated the repressor function of NtcA for nirP1 , consistent with previous ChIP-seq 16 and transcriptome data 21 . However, repression was still observed 6 h after the shift to N starvation, even when the binding motif was mutated rendering NtcA binding impossible, indicating the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms. It is possible that a second transcription factor is involved in the repression of nirP1 during N starvation. If the tandem repeat was mutated (P Repeat-Mut ), a signal close to baseline was detected in all tested conditions (Fig. 2b–d , Supplementary Dataset 3 ; Supplementary Fig. S3 ). We conclude that this motif is essential for the transcription of nirP1 , consistent with its position centered at −51.5 from the TSS at +1 (Fig. 2a ), a region where frequently transcription factors bind to activate transcription. Finally, transcriptional regulation was tested in response to the addition of ammonium (Fig. 2d ). The signal increased ~threefold after 1 h and then decreased, similar to the results obtained after the shift in LC conditions (Fig. 2b ). These data agree with the results of a recent transcriptome analysis in which the ncr1071 transcript was upregulated ~threefold during acclimation to ammonium stress 33 , indicating that the C/N balance is pivotal for the transcription of nirP1 . Collectively, these results demonstrated the complex transcriptional regulation of nirP1 . We validated the transcriptional regulation of nirP1 by NtcA and obtained new insight into the regulation of nirP1 in shifts to N deprivation and with different C/N ratios. Due to the observed strong regulation, we hypothesized that NirP1 might be a regulator and is likely involved in the acclimation to changing C i and N supply. Deletion and ectopic expression of NirP1 leads to phenotypical changes To test the potential functional importance of NirP1, we constructed the following strains: a gene deletion strain Δ nirP1 ; two overexpression strains in which the coding sequence of nirP1 was fused to a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag under control of the copper-inducible P petE promoter on a plasmid pVZ322 introduced in a wild type background (strain NirP1oex) and in the Δ nirP1 background (strain Δ nirP1 ::oex); and a complementation strain with the same plasmid as in the overexpression strains, except that nirP1 was controlled by its native promoter (Δ nirP1 :: nirP1 ). Under nutrient-replete conditions, the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant showed linear growth similar to the wild type. In contrast, both strains expressing nirP1 under control of the P petE promoter showed severely reduced growth in liquid medium, irrespective of whether the plasmid was in the wild type or the Δ nirP1 background (Fig. 3a ). The reduced growth observed at high nirP1 expression compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 was also visible under LC, while the strain grew normally if nirP1 was controlled by its native P nirP1 promoter (Fig. 3b ). Therefore, we concluded that the high expression of nirP1 from the P petE promoter led to reduced growth, in particular, to a prolonged lag phase (Supplementary Dataset 4 ). In addition, we noticed a pigmentation change, i.e., the cultures became chlorotic if nirP1 was overexpressed from the P petE promoter (Fig. 3c ). This effect was strictly dependent on the nirP1 expression level because cells of the non-induced mutant showed the same pigmentation as the wild type in the absence of added Cu 2 SO 4 . (Supplementary Fig. S4a ). This phenotype was verified in room temperature absorption spectra. Compared to the spectra of the wild type and deletion mutant, the phycobilisome peak at approximately 625 nm as well as the chlorophyll peaks at 440 and 680 nm were decreased in the two strains that expressed nirP1 from P petE after addition of Cu 2 SO 4 (Fig. 3d , Supplementary Dataset 4 ). Fig. 3: Phenotypical differences between nirP1 mutant strains and the wild type in BG11 medium. a Growth of wild type (black), the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant (red), and the strains expressing nirP1 under control of the P petE promoter in the wild-type background (dark blue, NirP1oex) and Δ nirP1 background (light blue, Δ nirP1 ::oex). Data points represent the mean ± SD of 3 biological replicates ( n = 3; details with growth rates and doubling time are provided in Supplementary Dataset 4 ). b Growth in liquid medium after shifting to LC conditions. Strains were cultivated for 2 h in medium containing 10 mM NaHCO 3 , collected, and transferred to medium without a C i source. The complementation strain (orange, Δ nirP1 :: nirP1 ) expressed nirP1 under the control of its native P nirP1 promoter in the Δ nirP1 background. Other strains as in ( a ); n = 3. c Pigmentation phenotype of wild-type and nirP1 overexpressors in the presence of Cu 2 SO 4 expressing nirP1 for 24 h.

Same strains and colors as in ( a ). Spectra were recorded from three biological replicates and averaged ( n = 3). Further phenotypical differences in Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5 . Full size image To extend these results, drop dilution assays were performed to compare growth on plates. Again, the strain that overexpressed nirP1 from the P petE promoter showed reduced vitality compared to the wild type and Δ nirP1 , irrespective of the addition of 10 mM NaHCO 3 (Supplementary Fig. S4b ). In conditions where nitrate was replaced by ammonium as the only N source, the phenotype was completely abolished (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). To summarize, the phenotypical effects due to ectopic NirP1 expression suggested that the amount of NirP1 played a critical role in the cell in presence of nitrate, while its absence did not lead to major phenotypic effects under the tested conditions. Metabolic changes in the GS/GOGAT and ammonia-ornithine cycle Upon nirP1 overexpression, the chlorotic phenotype (Fig. 3c, d ) resembled the pigmentation changes characteristic of N-starved cells. Together with the observed expression control by NtcA (Fig. 2 ), this suggested a primary relationship between NirP1 and processes related to the assimilation of N, albeit the regulatory effect of LC. Therefore, we tested whether the ectopic expression of NirP1 influences amino acid levels in the cell. Metabolites and amino acids were extracted in a time course experiment from wild type, Δ nirP1 , and NirP1oex following a shift to LC. The total amount of soluble amino acids was significantly higher in NirP1oex at 24 h after transfer to LC than in the other two strains (Fig. 4a , full data in Supplementary Dataset 5 ). However, a closer look at the data revealed that the higher amino acid levels in NirP1oex were mainly caused by the accumulation of a single amino acid, glutamate (Fig. 4b ). The glutamate level in Synechocystis 6803 is normally approximately 10 times higher than that of any other amino acid. Therefore, the increased accumulation of glutamate alone was responsible for the measured higher total amino acid amount in NirP1oex. However, for the direct product of glutamate amination by GS, glutamine, we measured lower levels in NirP1oex at 3 and 24 h after the shift to LC (Fig. 4b ). This result is consistent with previous analyses in which a decrease in glutamine content was observed in LC shifts 34 . In addition, we found that the concentrations of citrulline and arginine, which are produced from glutamine via the ornithine-ammonium cycle (OAC), were lowered in NirP1oex at 3, 12, and 24 h after the induction of expression (Fig. 4d ). In contrast, the aspartate levels were increased, consistent with its synthesis from glutamate by glutamate aspartate aminotransferase. These tendencies were confirmed in a repeat experiment (Supplementary Dataset 6 ). Furthermore, the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) was significantly higher in NirPoex than in the other strains (Fig. 4c ). This finding indicates an impaired regulation of the GS/GOGAT cycle and a reduced N assimilation caused by high NirP1 and is consistent with effect the of pigmentation (Fig. 3c ) and glutamine and glutamate concentration (Fig. 4b ). In the wild type and Δ nirP1 deletion mutant, 2-OG levels increased after 12 and 24 h, which was more pronounced in the deletion mutant pointing to a further regulation when NirP1 is absent (Fig. 4c ). We conclude that the upregulation of NirP1 caused several changes in amino acid levels related to the synchronization between C and N metabolism. As the OAC is involved in N storage and remobilization 35 , these results support that NirP1 plays a role as a regulator in N metabolism.

Metabolite content was measured for Δ nirP1 , NirP1oex, and wild type (WT). All concentrations are given in ng * mL −1 * OD750 nm −1 . Two biological replicates ( n = 2) were used for all strains and metabolites (except in c where the means ± SD of three biological replicates are shown, n = 3) and averaged (details and raw data in Supplementary Dataset 5 ). Significance was calculated with the two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t -test; *only P ≤ 0.05 are shown) for each strain and between the strains at corresponding time points. The measurements were independently repeated in triplicates ( n = 3) and the results confirmed (details in Supplementary Dataset 6 ). Full size image NirP1 interacts with ferredoxin-nitrite reductase Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) was successfully used in the past to identify the interacting partners of Synechocystis 6803 small proteins NblD, AtpΘ, and SliP4, thereby providing essential hints for their specific functions 25 , 26 , 36 . Therefore, we used a strain-expressing epitope-tagged NirP1 to obtain insight into the molecular mechanism that involves NirP1. After 24 h of induction, total cell extracts of three replicates of NirP1oex were analyzed by SDS‒PAGE and Western blotting using anti-FLAG antisera. The size of the NirP1-3xFLAG signal in the Western blot matched the sum of the calculated molecular masses of 9.81 kDa for NirP1 and 2.86 for the 3xFLAG tag. No signal was detected in the wild type used as a negative control (Fig. 5a ). Fig. 5: NirP1 expression and pull-down analysis. a Detection of NirP1 after 24 h of induction with 2 µM Cu 2 SO 4 by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum against tagged NirP1 in three biological replicates (R1–R3).

The main interacting protein was identified as ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR), which is encoded by the nirA/slr0898 gene. d Western blot of NirP1 co-IP fractions using native, denaturing, or reducing conditions. All samples were loaded in biological replicates R1 and R2. e NirP1-NiR (WP_010873675.1) interaction in Synechocystis 6803 predicted by AlphaFold 31 , 32 using their full-length sequences. The interaction modeled for the NiR and NirP1 homologs from Synechococcus 7942 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7b . Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image NirP1-3xFLAG and potential bound interaction partners were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-FLAG resin (Fig. 5b ). Elution fractions of the protein pull-down showed NirP1 in Coomassie-stained protein gels and an additional band of higher molecular mass in both replicates. Because signals were obtained in the Western blot at these two and a third position, this result pointed at potential interaction partners of NirP1 that were copurified with the bait protein. These additional proteins were still present after 8 washing steps, indicating a strong interaction with NirP1 (Fig. 5b ). Next, we subjected whole-cell lysates and eluate fractions to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS)-based proteome analysis for the identification of coimmunoprecipitated proteins. In addition to NirP1, a single other protein was strongly enriched, which was identified as the 56 kDa ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR), encoded by nirA ( slr0898 ) (Fig. 5c ). Overall, eight and 72 nonredundant peptides of the NirP1-3xFLAG protein and of NiR were detected, yielding high respective sequence coverages of 94% and 98% (Supplementary Datasets 7 , 8 , and 9 ). The combined molecular masses of NirP1 and NiR are compatible with the uppermost signal in the Western blot in Fig. 5b . These results indicated that NiR was a specifically enriched protein that coimmunoprecipitated with the NirP1-3xFLAG protein under the conditions used. To validate the potential complex formation between NirP1 and NiR, Western blot experiments were performed under different reducing conditions. Under native conditions, two bands appeared. The signal at the lower molecular mass matched the predicted molecular mass of monomeric NirP1, while the upper signal was consistent with the sum of NirP1 and NiR of ~70 kDa. After the samples were denatured by heating or reduced through an addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol, the ~70 kDa signal disappeared. The single remaining band migrated higher than the band of the native form, indicating that it was the monomeric and completely unfolded NirP1 protein (Fig. 5d ). Modeling by AlphaFold 31 , 32 predicted NirP1 binding to the NiR substrate binding pocket next to its catalytic center with the iron-sulfur cluster where the reduction of nitrite takes place (Fig. 5e ). Interestingly, none of the NirP1 cysteine residues, but two of the three totally conserved tryptophan residues (W36 and W65), were predicted close to the catalytic center. Thus, these amino acids potentially play a functional role. Excretion of nitrite is triggered by NirP1 To test if the action of NirP1 might lead to the excretion of nitrite in LC conditions, as previously reported for Synechococcus 7942 9 , we first verified if Synechocystis 6803 showed this effect as well. Indeed, after 2 h at LC, the Synechocystis 6803 wild type, but not the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant, started to excrete nitrite into the medium (Fig. 6a, b ). After 24 h at LC, the concentration of nitrite in the medium of the wild-type strain was ~5 µM. However, in the nirP1 -overexpressing strain the nitrite concentration was much higher with ~75 µM (Fig. 6a, b ). All three results (Δ nirP1 , wild type, NirP1oex) suggested that the excretion of nitrite into the supernatant was related to the presence of NirP1 in the cell. This effect was even more pronounced by the ectopic overexpression of NirP1 in BG11 medium aerated with 5% (v/v) CO 2 leading to an ~150-fold higher accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant of NirP1oex compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 grown samples (HC in Fig. 6a ). After the cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium, the overexpressor immediately excreted nitrite again (time point 0 in Fig. 6a ). These data establish that NirP1 triggers the excretion of nitrite. Fig. 6: Excretion of nitrite is triggered in the presence of NirP1. a Synechocystis 6803 strains were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 medium with 5% (v/v) CO 2 in air as high C i (HC), harvested and resuspended in new medium and aerated with 0.04% (v/v) CO 2 in air to initiate LC conditions. The wild type (WT) started to excrete nitrite in LC conditions when nirP1 was expressed (see Fig. 1c ). b Same data as in ( a ) but at different scales to include the results from the NirP1oex strain. Accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant was followed over time. c The consumption of nitrate, measured as the decrease in the concentration of nitrate in the supernatants after pelleting the cells by centrifugation. Strains were grown in BG11, washed with N-free BG11 (BG11 –N), set to OD = 1 and resuspended in BG11 containing 200 µM nitrate. d The production and excretion of nitrite into the supernatant measured in the same samples as in ( c ) for nitrate. Data are presented as the means ± SD of measuring biological triplicates in duplicates each ( n = 6). Significance was calculated using a two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t- test; ns no significance; *only P < 0.05 are shown) between the strains at corresponding time points. Full details are provided in Supplementary Dataset 10 . Full size image To ensure that the accumulated nitrite was a product of absorbed and reduced nitrate, the uptake of nitrate and subsequent excretion of nitrite were measured in parallel. The cultures were first grown in N-free BG11 medium and then 200 µM nitrate was added. In the control experiment, an additional 2 mM ammonia was added because nitrate uptake in Synechocystis is inhibited in the presence of ammonia and the transcription of nitrate and nitrite reductase genes is repressed. After 2 h, the overexpressor led to significant differences in nitrite concentration in the medium compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 . In addition, the overexpression seemed to slow the uptake of nitrate (Fig. 6c, d ). Here, the wild type, although less pronounced than the overexpressor, also excreted nitrite into the medium, as observed in the LC shift experiment before. In contrast, in the control experiment with additional ammonium, no nitrate uptake and no excretion of nitrite into the medium were observed (Supplementary Fig. S6a, b ). These results demonstrated that the accumulation of nitrite in the medium of the wild type and overexpression strains resulted from nitrate uptake, the subsequent reduction to nitrite by NR and the alteration of NiR activity, with the involvement by NirP1. Discussion Nitrate is one of the most abundant N-containing nutrients for cyanobacteria, while the preferred source for nitrogen assimilation is ammonium. Therefore, complex regulatory mechanisms occur to regulate nitrogen assimilation and uptake, e.g., genes of nitrate assimilation are repressed if ammonium is available 37 , 38 . When nitrate is the only N source available, it is taken up and reduced in two steps to nitrite and ammonium, which is then incorporated into glutamate in the GS/GOGAT cycle (Fig. 7 ). The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is catalyzed by the enzyme NR and the subsequent reduction to ammonium by NiR. NirP1, a small regulatory protein, is upregulated in LC conditions in Synechocystis 6803 (Fig. 1a ). Its elevated expression, as shown in this study, leads to the accumulation of nitrite in the medium. We identified NiR as the primary binding partner for NirP1 (Fig. 5c ). Therefore, the results can be explained if the NirP1:NiR interaction directly leads to the accumulation of nitrite in the cell, which is toxic and therefore becomes rapidly exported (Fig. 7 ). Excess internal nitrite has been shown to inhibit photosynthesis, particularly the activity of photosystem II in Synechocystis 6803 39 . Comparable responses were reported for N-starved Synechocystis 6803 mutants defective in glycogen synthesis that excreted 2-OG and pyruvate 34 . Fig. 7: NirP1 is a regulator at a central position in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen. Cyanobacteria can assimilate N from simple compounds, such as ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and urea. During nitrate assimilation, intracellular nitrate is reduced in two steps to nitrite and ammonium, which is then incorporated into glutamate in the GS/GOGAT cycle or into carbon skeletons during the synthesis of amino acids by transaminases. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is catalyzed by the NR and the subsequent reduction to ammonium by the NiR. Transcription of the regulatory factor NirP1 is controlled by an unknown transcription factor (TF) and by NtcA. 2-OG is a corepressor of NtcA. Therefore, an increased 2-OG level leads to the repression of nirP1 transcription, while a low level of 2-OG leads to its activation. NirP1 binds to the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR), leading to the inhibition of nitrite reduction. The accumulating nitrite is then rapidly exported by an unidentified export system. Transport systems for ammonium (AMT) and nitrate/nitrite (NRT) uptake are shown. Full size image Several factors control primary N metabolism, such as the transcription factor NtcA or the P II regulator and proteins interacting with them 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 . However, unlike several other regulatory proteins that modulate the activity of other regulators (e.g., PirA and PipX), NirP1 targets one of the key enzymes of N assimilation metabolism directly. This is reminiscent of the direct inhibitory role of the small GS inhibitory factors IF7 and IF17 17 . These findings suggest that a higher number of relatively small proteins might exist that modulate or modify the activity of relevant enzymes and await characterization. To examine the possible mode of action, we further predicted the interactions between NiR and other proteins. In Synechocystis 6803, ferredoxin Fd1 ( ssl0020, petF ) acts as an electron donor for the reduction of nitrite 40 . Therefore, we modeled the interaction of NiR with NirP1 (Fig. 5e ) and Fd1 (Supplementary Fig. S7a ). The results suggested that both proteins compete for the binding pocket of NiR. By binding NirP1 instead of Fd1, the binding pocket is blocked for electron transfer and the subsequent reduction of nitrite to ammonium. Thus, this could be a possible mechanism by which NirP1 inhibits NiR, leading to the excretion and accumulation of nitrite in the medium during NirP1 expression. Transcription of nirP1 is controlled by an unknown transcription factor and by NtcA. If 2-OG cannot be aminated efficiently in the GS-GOGAT cycle due to N starvation, C i oversupply, or a combination of both, it will accumulate in the cell. The increased 2-OG level is sensed by PII and transferred to NtcA, leading to stronger promoter binding and the repression of nirP1 transcription. Therefore, NirP1 is at the confluence of C and N assimilation and is effectively a regulator of the C/N balance. In addition to the NtcA-binding site, we found another putative promoter element at position −43 to −60 (Fig. 2a ), the mutation of which rendered the nirP1 promoter inactive. Therefore, this element is likely recognized by a positively acting transcription factor, although its identity was not further investigated in this work and should be studied in the future. It was previously reported that during photoautotrophic growth in shifts to LC conditions, Synechococcus 7942 excreted nitrite into the medium 9 . As the fundamental reason for this observation, a decline in the enzymatic activity of NiR was identified that started within 30 min. This decline was not a consequence of changed nirA expression because the observed decrease in NiR activity under LC conditions was substantially larger than that observed when the cultures were treated with rifampicin to inhibit transcription. Instead, a mechanism was postulated that directly inactivated NiR under LC conditions 9 . Our data were obtained in Synechocystis 6803, but a close NirP1 homolog is found in Synechococcus 7942 (Fig. 1b ), and an almost identical interaction with NiR was predicted (Supplementary Fig. S7b, c ). Therefore, we have likely identified the mechanism underlying previously observed NiR inhibition and nitrite excretion. We calculated that approximately 5% of assimilated nitrate was excreted as nitrite into the medium by Synechocystis 6803 in the first 2 h (Fig. 6c, d ). Compared to Prochlorococcus strains MIT0917 and SB, and Synechococcus 7942, which were reported to excrete up to 30% of the assimilated nitrate as nitrite 6 , 9 , the here-measured nitrite excretion of Synechocystis 6803 was less pronounced. Previous studies reported for Synechocystis 6803 a higher excretion, of up to 60% of the reduced nitrate under mixotrophic conditions 41 , which clearly shows that Synechocystis 6803 is capable to release high nitrite amounts into the medium. The nirP1 overexpression strain was obviously not significantly inhibited by the remaining nitrite, which could indicate that it had a way to avoid nitrite poisoning by storing it at a physiologically neutral place (or the regulation by NirP1 was not completely inhibiting the NiR activity). Indeed, there is circumstantial evidence for such a nitrite storage, possibly in the periplasm. We observed a very fast immediate release of nitrite from washed cells of the NirP1oex strain (see time point 0 in Fig. 6a ), which then was followed only by a slower further increase. Thus, under photoautotrophic conditions used here, the cells may have a mechanism to store most of the nitrite in order to resume normal N assimilation when the C i supply increases again. This points at a possible mechanism for deciding whether nitrite is released or kept within the cell, depending on the physiological conditions. These points are interesting topics for future research. According to our data, NirP1 expression is upregulated under LC conditions and then participated in the inhibition of NiR, leading to nitrite excretion and accumulation. Surprisingly, the regulation occurs at an unexpected point (Fig. 7 ), as controlling N assimilation during nitrate uptake or during nitrate reduction seems more intuitive. Here, uncontrolled nitrate uptake led to light-dependent nitrite excretion under low light conditions 42 . Therefore, the availability of electrons could play a role because the reduction of nitrite requires six moles of reduced ferredoxin, while the reduction of nitrate requires only two. Another consideration is the possible beneficial effect of nitrite excretion on cooccurring microbes in the natural environment. Certain Prochlorococcus release up to 30% of their N uptake as extracellular nitrite when grown on nitrate 6 . Prochlorococcus typically contains the most compact genomes of any free-living cyanobacteria, which was linked to its quasi-homeostatic environment 43 , 44 , 45 . Because we did not identify NirP1 homologs in Prochlorococcus , the underlying mechanism probably operates without NirP1. In other strains of cyanobacteria, exposed to greater variations in the environment, the involvement of NirP1 has likely led to a more accurate regulation. In any case, the release of an N cycle intermediate, such as nitrite, should have tremendous relevance for certain other members of the microbiome. Our results show that homologs of NirP1 are widely distributed among cyanobacteria, expanding our understanding of how C and N metabolism become integrated in these organisms. Methods Cultivation conditions and spectrometric measurements Strains were maintained in BG11 or in copper-free BG11 28 supplemented with 20 mM TES pH 7.5 under continuous white light of 50 µmol photons m −2 s −1 at 30 °C. Mutant strains containing pVZ322-derived plasmids were cultivated in the presence of 50 µg/mL kanamycin, while Δ nirP1 was maintained at 20 µg/mL streptomycin. The cultures for overexpression of NirP1 using the P petE promoter for pull-down experiments and MS measurements were grown either in BG11 or under CellDeg® conditions supplemented with 2 µM CuSO 4 . Cultivation with CellDeg® conditions was performed for 4 days in 100 mL FOM (freshwater organism medium; 50 mM NaNO 3 , 15 mM KNO 3 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.025 mM H 3 BO 3 , supplemented with 0.15 mM FeCl 3 /Na 2 EDTA, 1.6 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2.4 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 nM MnCl 2 , 0.1 nM ZnSO 4 , 2 nM Na 2 MoO 4 , 10 pM CuSO 4 , and 30 pM CoCl 2 ) inoculated with culture with a starting OD of ~0.8 and 150 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 . High CO 2 concentrations were delivered to the flasks from a carbonate buffer (0.3 M K 2 CO 3 and 2.7 M KHCO 3 ) through a highly gas-permeable polypropylene membrane. Light intensity was increased during growth according to the cell density. 24 h prior harvesting the cells (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min), protein expression was started by adding 2 µM CuSO 4 . Cultures in growth experiments and phenotypic assays were grown in BG11 medium supplemented with copper but without antibiotics to prevent any possible side effects. Whole-cell absorption spectra were measured using a Specord® 250 Plus (Analytik Jena) spectrophotometer at room temperature and were normalized to the wild type at 750 nm. Cultures were measured in triplicate. Cultures at an OD 750 > 1 were diluted with 1× BG11 prior to taking the absorption spectra. Construction of mutant and overexpression lines Synechocystis 6803 PCC-M 46 was used as the wild type and background for the construction of mutants. Knockout mutants were generated by replacing the nirP1 ( ncr1070 ) coding sequence with a streptomycin resistance cassette ( aadA ) 47 by homologous recombination and using pUC19 as a vector for subcloning. The construct for gene replacement was generated by AQUA cloning 48 . Details of primer sequences and plasmids are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . Segregation of nirP1 and Δ nirP1/aadA alleles was checked by colony PCR using the primers P_AK9 and P_AK10 (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To complement the knockout and create a NirP1-overexpressing strain, nirP1 was inserted into the self-replicating pVZ322 plasmid under control of the Cu 2+ -inducible P petE promoter or under control of its native promoter (P nirP1 ). The inserts for the overexpression of nirP1 were assembled into pVZ322 predigested by Xba I and Pst I for 16 h at 37 °C by AQUA cloning 48 . The constructs were checked using the primers P_AK16 and P_AK17 (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The sequence-verified plasmids were introduced into Synechocystis 6803 by electroporation 49 . For the electroporation, culture was cultivated to exponential phase with OD ~ 0.7–1.0, 25 mL washed three times with ice-cold HEPES buffer (1 mM, pH = 7.5) and resuspended in 0.5 mL HEPES buffer. 1 µg of plasmid was mixed with 100 µL of cells and transferred into a precooled Gene Pulser/MicroPulser Electroporation Cuvettes (0.2 cm gap, BIO-RAD). A pulse of 12.5 kV and 4 ms was executed (MicroPulser Electroporator, BIO-RAD), 1 mL of BG11 (BG11 lacking copper for constructs using the petE promotor) was added to the cells and transferred to 50 mL BG11 for 24 h cultivation under continuous light of 50 µmol photons m −2 s −1 at 30 °C. The culture was harvested (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min), resuspended in 100 µL BG11, and plated on 0.75% Kobe-agar plate with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and cultivated for 5 days. Single colonies were transferred on a new plate and verified by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1 , Supplementary Table S1 ). The expression of nirP1 was checked by Western hybridization using ANTI-FLAG antisera (Sigma–Aldrich, #SAB4301135). RNA preparation and northern blot verification Cultures were grown in BG11 supplemented with 10 mM NHCO 3 (HC), washed three times with BG11 lacking any C i source (LC), and grown for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in LC conditions to induce nirP1 expression. The time immediately before C i removal (0 h, HC) served as the negative control. Cells were collected by filtration through hydrophilic polyethersulfone filters (Pall Supor®−800, 0.8 μm), transferred into PGTX buffer, and instantly frozen in liquid N 2 50 . Samples were incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in a water bath, one volume chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added, and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with several vortexing cycles. After centrifugation for 3 min at 3250 × g , the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, one volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was added. This step was repeated twice. RNA was precipitated by the addition of one volume of isopropanol and incubated for 16 h at −20 °C. For northern blot verification, 10 μg of RNA per well was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide-8.3 M urea gel and electroblotted onto Hybond N nylon+ membranes (Amersham) with 1 mA per cm 2 for 1 h. nirP1 transcript accumulation was analyzed by Northern hybridization using single-stranded radioactively labeled RNA probes transcribed in vitro from PCR-generated templates using primer P_AK30 and P_AK31 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The radioactively labeled probes were generated using [α- 32 P]-UTP and the Maxiscript T7 In vitro transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hybridizations were performed in 50% deionized formamide, 7% SDS, 250 mM NaCl, and 120 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.2 overnight at 62 °C. The membranes were washed in buffer 1 (2× SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1% SDS), buffer 2 (1× SSC, 0.5% SDS) and buffer 3 (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) each for 10 min. All wash steps were performed at 57 °C. Signals were detected with a Laser Scanner Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare). Signal intensities of nirP1 were determined using Quantity One software (BIO-RAD) and normalized to the signal of the 5S rRNA (Fig. 1c ). Promoter analysis To verify nirP1 promoter activity in vivo in Synechocystis 6803, the nucleotides −70 to +30 (TSS at +1) were fused to luxAB reporter genes and integrated into the genome. Initially, cultures were set to an OD 0.7 and grown under standard BG11 or HC conditions for 2 h and subsequently transferred to NO 3 − - or NaCO 3 -free BG11 or BG11 medium supplemented with additional NH 4 Cl to induce transcription. Measurements were carried out for 24 h in LC or high NH 4 Cl conditions or for 7 days under N deprivation. To recover from N starvation, the bleached cells were transferred back to standard BG11 medium after 7 days and observed for 3 days. Bioluminescence was measured in vivo as total light counts per second by using a VICTOR 3 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer). Prior to the measurement, cells were diluted to an OD 750 = 0.7 and 200 μL of the suspension were filled into a white 96-well plate (CulturePlate™−96, PerkinElmer). To increase the signal, 2 µL of Decanal was added to the samples. In the multiplate reader the cell suspensions were shaken for 10 s and subsequently total light emission was measured for 1 s. A strain carrying the promotorless luxAB genes served as a negative control 51 . The raw data, the calculation, and statistical evaluations are provided in Supplementary Dataset 3 . Co-IP, LC-MS/MS analyses, and data processing The overexpression of NirP1-3xFLAG was induced in exponentially growing cultures of the Synechocystis 6803 strain NirP1oex in the CellDeg system by adding Cu 2 SO 4 to a final concentration of 2 µM. 50 mL of cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min) after 24 h of NirP1-3xFLAG overexpression, resuspended in 2 mL FLAG buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 25 mM CaCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.1% Tween-20) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor (cOmplete, Roche) mixed with 100 μL of glass beads (Ø 0.1–0.25 mm, Retsch) and lysed mechanically in a prechilled Precelly24 (Bertin Instruments) with three rounds of shaking at 6000 rpm (10 s) followed by a pause (5 s) per cycle, for a total of 5 cycles. To remove cell debris and glass beads, extracts were centrifuged (1000 × g , 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were collected for further processing. Remaining cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g , 4 °C, 30 min). The cleared total cell lysate was subjected to co-IP using Anti-FLAG M2 affinity magnetic beads (Sigma–Aldrich) rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 8 times with FLAG buffer (2 min, 4 °C, rotating). Bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma–Aldrich, 100 ng/µL) in TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH = 7.6) at 4 °C. Two independent replicates were prepared. Protein concentrations of eluate fractions and respective whole-cell lysates were measured in the Coomassie Plus Bradford Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through the plate photo reader 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer) in duplicate, and 500 µL of each was subsequently snap frozen. Proteins in whole-cell lysates were purified by acetone/methanol precipitation 52 , and co-IP eluates were lyophilized. For further analysis, samples were resolubilized in denaturation buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 100 mM Tris/HCl; pH 8.0) at a final protein concentration of 1 µg/µL. Protein disulfide bonds were reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min and the resulting thiol groups were alkylated with iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 5.5 mM for 45 min. Predigestion of proteins with Lys-C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h was followed by dilution with 4 volumes of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8, and overnight digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega), both at protease/protein ratios of 1/100. The resulting peptide solutions were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2.5, and an aliquot corresponding to 10 µg peptides was purified by stage tips 53 . For LC‒MS/MS-based protein analysis, 40 ng of each sample was loaded onto an in-house-made 20 cm column with 75 µm ID, packed with ReproSil-Pur 1.9 µm C18 material (Dr. Maisch, Germany) and separated by RP chromatography on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using 60 min gradients. Eluting peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as described elsewhere 54 . All raw spectra were processed with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.8.0) 55 at default settings. The match between run option and label-free quantification (LFQ) was enabled. Peak lists were searched against an in-house modified target-decoy database of Synechocystis 6803 with 3,681 protein sequences, including the NirP1-3xFLAG fusion protein sequence. False discovery rates were limited to 1% at the peptide and protein levels. LFQ protein intensities of two independent co-IPs were normalized by corresponding values from whole-cell extract measurements, log 2 transformed, and plotted against each other using the Perseus software suite (version 1.6.5.0) 56 . SDS‒PAGE, native gel electrophoresis and western blotting Proteins were mixed with denaturing or reducing loading dye (5× concentrated: 250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 10% SDS, 500 mM DTT, and 0.05% bromophenol blue G-250). Moreover, 6% ß-mercaptoethanol (v/v) was added fresh to the sample in reducing conditions before heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The protein samples were separated by 12% SDS‒PAGE using the PageRuler TM molecular weight marker (Thermo Fisher). To run samples under nonreducing conditions, a native loading dye (5× concentrated: 30% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue G-250, 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) was used, and boiling was omitted. To make proteins visible, the gel was stained with Coomassie dye. The gel was incubated for 30 min under slight shaking, covered with Instant Blue Coomassie Protein Stain (Abcam), and washed overnight with ddH 2 O. For immunoblot analysis, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Amersham TM Protan, pore size 0.4 5 µm). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk powder in TBS-T, washed three times (10 min), and subsequently probed with monoclonal ANTI-FLAG® M2-Peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Sigma–Aldrich, #SAB4301135 at a dilution of 1:5000) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and washed again three times (10 min). All washing steps were performed with TBS-T (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) at room temperature. Signals were detected with WesternBright TM ECL-spray (Advansta) on a chemiluminescence imager system (Fusion SL, Vilber Lourmat) and subsequently visualized using FUSION-CAP (Vilber Lourmat) and Quantity One software (BIO-RAD). Nitrate and nitrite measurements Wild type, Δ nirP1 , and nirP1 -overexpressing cultures were cultivated photoautotrophically in BG11 medium with 5% (v/v) CO 2 in air as the high CO 2 condition (HC), harvested and resuspended in new medium and aerated with 0.04% (v/v) CO 2 in air to start low CO 2 (LC) conditions. Samples were taken under HC conditions before cells were shifted to LC conditions and then after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h of growth in LC conditions and measured in biological triplicates. To measure nitrate uptake and nitrite accumulation, cells were washed three times and resuspended in BG11 without NaNO 3 (BG11-N) lacking CuSO 4 . After incubation for 1 h, only 200 µM NaNO 3 as the nitrogen source or NaNO 3 together with 2 mM NH 4 Cl and a final concentration of 2 µM CuSO 4 were added. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and centrifuged (16,800 × g , 5 min, room temperature). Concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined by ion chromatography measurements or with the Griess Reagent Kit (Promega). For IC measurements, samples were mixed with methanol (1:3 (v:v)) and centrifuged three times (16,800 × g , 10 min, room temperature), and 10 µL was loaded and separated by a column (DionexTM IonPacTM AS11-HC, Thermo Fischer). Ions were identified, and concentrations were quantified using the area (µS min −1 ) given in the software (Chromeleon® 7). Standards at various concentrations were used for calibration. The raw data, calculations, and statistical evaluations are given in Supplementary Dataset 10. Nitrite was measured after conversion into an azo dye 57 . The determination limit was 0.09 µmol L −1 . The combined standard uncertainty was 4.9%. Samples higher than the measuring range were diluted with ultrapure water. Extraction and metabolite analysis Wild type, Δ nirP1 , and nirP1 overexpressor cultures were set in duplicates or triplicates to an OD of 0.5 and grown for 24 h without antibiotics before cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3,210 × g, 10 min, room temperature), washed three times in copper-free BG11 medium and induction of NirP1 was started by adding 2 µM CuSO 4 after 1 h. After 0, 1, 3, 12, and 24 h of incubation, 2 mL of each culture was collected by centrifugation (16,800 × g , 5 min, room temperature) and immersed in liquid N 2 . For extraction, 630 µL of methanol containing carnitine (internal standard, 1 mg per extraction) was added, mixed for 1 min, and incubated for 5 min in a sonic water bath. After another 15 min of shaking at room temperature, 400 µL of chloroform was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Next, 800 µL of ROTISOLV LC‒MS grade H 2 O (Roth) was added, and the sample was mixed thoroughly. Precipitation was enabled by storage at 22 °C for at least 2 h, and phase separation was subsequently achieved by centrifugation for 5 min at room temperature (16,800 × g ). The upper polar phase was collected and dried in a speed vac for 30 min followed by lyophilization overnight. Absolute metabolite contents were quantified on a high-performance liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometer LC‒MS-8050 system (Shimadzu) 58 . Dried samples were dissolved in 200 μL LC‒MS grade water and filtered through 0.2-mm filters (Omnifix-F, Braun, Germany), and 5 μL of the cleared supernatant was separated on a pentafluorophenylpropyl column (Supelco Discovery HS FS, 3 mm, 150 3 2.1 mm). The compounds were identified and quantified using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) values given in the LC‒MS/MS method package and the LabSolutions software package (Shimadzu). Authentic standard substances (Merck) at various concentrations were used for calibration, and peak areas were normalized to signals of the internal standard (carnitine). The data were further normalized to the OD 750 and volume measured for each sample. The raw data and estimations as absolute values in ng per mL per OD 750 are given in Supplementary Datasets 5 and 6 , with all the statistical evaluations.

Credit: NASA Earth Observatory Cyanobacteria blooms (blue-green algae) are a frequent occurrence in the Great Lakes, particularly in Lake Erie, Green Bay, and Saginaw Bay. These blooms may cause fish kills and discolored or foul-smelling water, affecting both human and ecosystem health. NOAA provides forecasts of cyanobacteria blooms for Lake Erie from July to October. Some cyanobacteria blooms can grow rapidly and produce toxins that cause harm to animal life and humans, so scientists describe them as harmful algal blooms (HABs).

Home Environmental Public Health Aquatic Toxins Harmful Algae Blooms HABs: Harmful Algae Blooms Aquatic Toxins Program Â 850-245-4250 Â healthhabinfo@flhealth.gov Algae are plant-like organisms that sustain marine life. They contribute to the food chain and to the oxygen that keeps water bodies healthy, but sometimes, when conditions are right—often warm water and increased nutrients—certain algae can quickly grow and overpopulate. These foam- or scum-like masses are called blooms and can be pushed to the shore by winds, waves, tides and currents. Some blooms release toxins that make ecosystems, animals and people sick; scientists call these harmful algae blooms (HABs). In Florida, HABs can be found among our saltwater, freshwater and brackish water bodies. HABs usually happen in summer or early fall and can affect small and large areas of a waterbody. Blooms can move around and change in a waterbody due to tides, winds and naturally fluctuating amounts of the algae. While a specific location might not constantly have a bloom, the bloom itself can continue for weeks, months or over a year. As some HABs decay, they release a bad odor due to hydrogen sulfide, a foul smelling gas that is a naturally occurring and colorless product of decomposition. It can smell like rotten eggs. The human nose is very sensitive and can smell the unpleasant odor of hydrogen sulfide at very low levels. The Florida Department of Health completed testing in 2016 and 2018 for the presence of hydrogen sulfide in the air during HAB events. The results from both studies indicated very low , non-hazardous levels. The smell can cause respiratory irritation, but is not harmful to your health. If you are irritated by the strong odor or have breathing difficulties, move away from the source of the smell. Symptoms should end a short time after the odor disappears or the exposure to the odor ends. Animals can also be impacted by harmful algal blooms. For more information available to veterinarians and pet owners, see Education and Resources . There are many HAB species in the Gulf of Mexico. K arenia brevis ( K. brevis ), a single-celled, naturally occurring organism belonging to a group of algae called dinoflagellates, is the common cause of red tide in Florida. Red tide can discolor water to appear red or brown, and it produces potent neurotoxins, called brevetoxins, that can be harmful to the health of both people and animals. Brevetoxins can be released into the air or water when wind and waves break open the algae cells. Respiratory irritation can occur when exposed to brevetoxins. SYMPTOMS? Even if you are not prone to respiratory issues, you should be careful. Red tide can cause coughing and sneezing and can irritate your eyes, nose and throat. Reactions to red tide can be worse for people with asthma, emphysema, bronchitis or any chronic lung disease. You can get relief from respiratory symptoms by being in an air-conditioned space. For people without asthma or chronic respiratory problems, over-the-counter antihistamines can help. If your symptoms do not improve, contact or visit a doctor or call the Florida Poison Information Center at 1-800-222-1222. SWIMMING Do not swim in or around red tide because the toxin can cause skin irritation, rashes and burning and sore eyes.  If you come into contact with red tide, wash off with soap and water, especially if your skin is easily irritated. DEAD FISH Red tides can kill fish and other marine life—avoid contact with and don’t swim or walk in these areas. Keep your pets away from these areas. RED TIDE AND FISH Do not harvest or eat distressed or dead fish (or any animals) from or near a red tide. Fish caught live and healthy can be eaten if filleted and rinsed thoroughly with fresh water. RED TIDE AND SHELLFISH Check local harvesting status at Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Bivalve mollusks, including clams, oysters, mussels and scallops are filter feeders that can concentrate toxins—these and other shellfish, if harvested from red tide areas, can be contaminated with brevetoxins. The muscle of the scallop is generally free of toxin but the rest of the scallop is not (recipes using scallop muscle are safe to eat). In addition, marine gastropods, commonly called sea snails (conch, whelk, etc), feed on the bivalves, therefore, they can also be contaminated with brevetoxins during a red tide. Your safest choice is to not harvest or eat molluscan shellfish or marine gastropods from red tide affected areas. You could suffer from Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning (NSP) if you eat contaminated shellfish. NSP symptoms include: nausea and vomiting; tingling of the mouth, lips and tongue; and slurred speech and dizziness. Neurological symptoms can progress to partial paralysis and respiratory problems. There are severa l species of b lue -green algae (also known as cyanobacteria) that can occur in Florida’s fresh or brackish waterbodies , many of which have the potential to produce toxins. If people or animals splash in the water or if boats create wakes, the algae cells can be broken apart, and the cyanotoxins can release into the air. The toxins mix with water droplets and spray, causing people and animals to potentially inhale the toxin. Though contact with the algae may cause skin irritation, these toxins cannot pass through your skin easily, so swallowing large amounts of contaminated water is what can typically cause illness. Blue green algae blooms can be described as discolored water in a variety of colors such as blue, bright green, brown or red and appear as paint-like streaks on the surface of the water, dense scum, or foam that can emit unpleasant odors. Pets can become sick from blue-green algae so keep them out of those areas and away from contaminated marine animals and fish. SYMPTOMS? For some people, exposure to blue-green algae can cause rashes, stomach cramps, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. People who are very sensitive to smells can have respiratory irritation. Sometimes, high exposures of toxin can affect the liver and nervous system. If you come into contact with blue-green algae or think that blue-green algae has made you sick, contact or visit a doctor or call the Florida Poison Information Center at 1-800-222-1222. CONTAMINATED WATER Water from areas with blue-green algae can make people and animals sick—stay away from these areas. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae blooms. Boiling the water will not eliminate toxins. SWIMMING Do not swim in or around blue-green algae. If you come into contact with blue-green algae, wash off with soap and water, especially if your skin is easily irritated. BLUE-GREEN ALGAE AND FISH Fish tested from water with blue-green algae show that cyanotoxins do not significantly accumulate in the edible parts—muscle or filet—of fish, but can in other organs. Prior to consuming, rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts, and cook the fish well. Do not eat shellfish in waters with blue-green algae blooms.

Freshwater cyanobacteria are found in all lakes and reservoirs. Cyanobacteria are naturally occurring and important to water ecosystems. However, excessive growth of these bacteria may cause harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs, also called cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs), which may also produce toxins. These toxins can negatively impact people, animals, and the environment through water recreation (swimming and boating), drinking water, livestock, fisheries and irrigation. Cyanobacterial biomass can result in unsightly surface scums, water taste and odor issues, hypoxia, reduced aquatic diversity and even socio-economic impacts. Due to climate and land use pressures, there is concern that HCBs may increase in frequency, extent, and magnitude, but it can be difficult to know when and where HCBs may form. EPA’s Safe and Sustainable Water Resources research uses a range of data sources and methods to characterize HCBs in waterbodies. One example of this research is a recently published paper from EPA scientists Blake Schaeffer, Wilson Salls, Deron Smith, John Johnston, Mark Myer, and former Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) participants Natalie Reynolds and Hannah Ferriby. Their work developed a scientific approach for forecasting freshwater HCBs using satellite data. This approach was the first of its kind to successfully forecast high-risk HCB events across 2,192 of the largest lakes in the contiguous U.S. “There is a lot of ongoing research to forecast HCBs at small scales for lakes, but the novelty of this approach is that it does so at such a broad spatial scale,” Wilson Salls, an EPA environmental scientist, said. The forecasting approach will be especially useful to water quality managers, as it provides a seven-day advanced notice of blooms. In the paper, the authors demonstrated the approach for the entire 2021 calendar year. EPA researcher Wilson Salls preparing instruments on a boat for a satellite overpass. “Our research may be one of the first times that we are examining and predicting water quality analogous to weather forecasting,” Blake Schaeffer, an EPA research scientist, explained. The researchers applied Bayesian modeling, which is a probabilistic statistical method, in combination with satellite monitoring data and a set of simple environmental predictors to estimate the probability of a cyanobacterial bloom occurring in a given week. It used cyanobacteria presence data sourced from the Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) project along with environmental predictor variables from 2017 to 2020. The prediction results were compared against the actual cyanobacteria presence observed in satellite imagery to provide performance statistics for 2021. The model’s overall prediction accuracy was 90%. “This research provides a tool that uses a large dataset of past HCB information from satellite imagery, and predictors such as lake morphology, lake temperature, and precipitation, to deliver a good prediction of future HCB events,” Mark Myer, an EPA risk assessor, said. Meet Our Researchers Meet EPA Scientist Blake Schaeffer Meet Our Other Water Researchers The studied model is in direct response to The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act , which requires EPA to advance the scientific understanding and ability to detect, monitor, assess, and predict HAB and hypoxia events in freshwater across the U.S. In the future, this approach may be used operationally to forecast HCBs and help water resource managers and associated public health professionals in their planning and response efforts. “CyAN gave us a powerful tool to provide the monitoring and many of our state and tribal partners rely on that tool. The new model delivers on the forecasting side and the approach will help those same partners get ahead of blooms and provide better protection for human health and the environment,” Michael Paul, an EPA ecologist, said. Schaeffer will present this work at the first HABs, Hypoxia, and Nutrients Research Webinar on January 31 st at 2:00 p.m. ET.

Despite their aridity, they are often inhabited by diverse microscopic communities of cyanobacteria. These organisms are commonly found in lithic habitats, where they are partially sheltered from extremes of temperature and UV radiation. However, living under the rock surface imposes additional constraints, such as limited light availability, and enrichment of longer wavelengths than are typically usable for oxygenic photosynthesis. Some cyanobacteria from the genus Chroococcidiopsis can use this light to photosynthesize, in a process known as far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This genus has commonly been reported from both hot and cold deserts. However, not all Chroococcidiopsis strains carry FaRLiP genes, thus motivating our study into the interplay between FaRLiP and extreme lithic environments. The abundance of sequence data and strains provided the necessary material for an in-depth phylogenetic study, involving spectroscopy, microscopy, and determination of pigment composition, as well as gene and genome analyses. Pigment analyses revealed the presence of red-shifted chlorophylls d and f in all FaRLiP strains tested. In addition, eight genus-level taxa were defined within the encompassing Chroococcidiopsidales , clarifying the phylogeny of this long-standing polyphyletic order. FaRLiP is near universally present in a generalist genus identified in a wide variety of environments, Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto , while it is rare or absent in closely related, extremophile taxa, including those preferentially inhabiting deserts. This likely reflects the evolutionary process of gene loss in specialist lineages.

Neufeld Comparative genomics reveals insights into cyanobacterial evolution and habitat adaptation Article 17 September 2020 Meng-Yun Chen, Wen-Kai Teng, … Wen-Sheng Shu Introduction Environment shapes evolution, in both the macro- and microcosmos. Among bacteria, the oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria have diversified to occupy numerous niches by synthesizing specific pigments, forming biofilms, or fixing atmospheric nitrogen [ 1 , 2 ]. Early colonizing cyanobacteria are often the most significant carbon inputs in extreme, nutrient-poor environments, including deserts [ 3 , 4 ]. Defined in this work as (hyper-)arid environments (Aridity Index <0.2, or Potential Evapotranspiration <400 mm for cold deserts) [ 5 ], they encompass places as varied as the Atacama Desert and University Valley in Antarctica, and are often subject to additional stresses, such as high or low temperatures, large daily temperature variations, ice crystal nucleation, and intense solar radiation [ 4 ]. For this reason, many desert cyanobacteria colonize the subsurface or the interior of rocks [ 4 , 6 , 7 ]. A microorganism commonly inhabiting deserts is the cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis . This genus is characterized by non-motile solitary spherical cells forming non-polarized agglomerations, and the ability to reproduce by non-motile baeocytes [ 8 , 9 ]. It has been isolated from cold and hot deserts, hot springs, and spacecraft assembly clean rooms [ 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ], with some isolates even surviving space [ 17 , 18 ]. Previous studies have highlighted extreme temperature tolerance as a lineage-specific trait, with different lineages characteristic of hot or cold deserts, respectively [ 15 , 19 ]. Nevertheless, strains have also been found in seemingly moderate environments [ 12 , 20 , 21 ]. This environmental diversity, combined with the large number of strains available from culture collections, make Chroococcidiopsis an ideal test subject for the study of adaptations to extreme environments. It has become clear that at least some members of the Chroococcidiopsis genus can also thrive in the absence of visible light, for instance in soil, biofilms, or within sedimentary rocks, by using far-red light / near-infrared radiation (~700–750 nm) [ 16 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ]. In order to do so, they undergo a process called far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP). This involves the extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus and the synthesis of new pigments, namely chlorophyll f , as well as traces (<1%) of chlorophyll d [ 23 , 27 , 28 ]. The significance of chlorophyll d in particular is an unsolved puzzle, as some studies locate it in the reaction center of far-red Photosystem II [ 23 , 29 ], yet many strains appear to lack it altogether [ 21 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ]. In addition, FaRLiP relies on a 20-gene cluster encoding paralogues of Photosystem I, Photosystem II and phycobilisome components, as well as a phytochrome regulatory cascade [ 24 ]. It is present in a small but diverse range of cyanobacteria, and is mainly associated with shading by other photosynthetic organisms [ 22 , 24 ]. However, certain types of rock such as quartz may create similar microenvironments through the preferential transmission of longer wavelengths [ 6 , 16 ]. As desert Chroococcidiopsis strains have been frequently isolated from lithic habitats, they might provide models for understanding not only the evolution of far-red light photoacclimation, but also its role in the environment. Some Chroococcidiopsis lineages are either hot or cold desert specialists [ 15 , 19 ]. Other strains from moderate environments might be generalists, based on the wide spread of this genus [ 12 , 20 ]. Comparing their FaRLiP capacities could highlight selective pressures and constraints for the habitat. Nevertheless, recent research casts doubt on taxonomically assigning certain extremophilic lineages to the same genus. For example, the lineage known as “Cold Desert Chroococcidiopsis ” has recently been typified as the separate genus Aliterella [ 35 ]. Still, there is strong evidence of FaRLiP being present in the last common ancestor of Chroococcidiopsidales (the order containing Chroococcidiopsis ), thereby motivating our research [ 22 , 36 ]. Traditionally, many related strains have been intermixed and simplified as “ Chroococcidiopsis ”. Recent research has been addressing this topic, but an overarching view that combines fine-scale 16S rRNA gene, genomic and ecological data is still missing [ 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ]. The availability of cultured strains sampled from all over the world, together with the recent expansion in sequencing data, including metadata and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), enabled this investigation. Therefore, this work presents a fine-grained evolutionary history of far-red light photoacclimation within the genus Chroococcidiopsis , and reveals a stark contrast in FaRLiP maintenance in generalist versus specialist taxa. In the process, this work also clarifies phylogenetic relationships within this genus and its associated order. Materials and methods Cyanobacterial strains and cultivation The 43 cyanobacterial strains were obtained from the culture collections PCC, SAG, CCALA, CCMEE, and BCCM/ULC (Table S1 ). The last two provided the extremophilic strains. All strains were grown in BG11 [ 9 ] at room temperature, apart from Antarctic BCCM/ULC strains (10 °C). Far-red light incubators used LEDs centered at 750 nm (LED750-03AU, Roithner). Cultures were grown in parallel under white light. The photon flux ranged between 10 and 30 μmol photons m –2 s –1 . Fluorescence microscopy and spectra In order to investigate photosynthetic acclimation, fluorescence images and spectral scans of cyanobacterial samples were acquired with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Leica SP8) using a HC PL APO x63/1.40 oil CS2 objective. Strains were grown for more than 20 days under FRL, immobilized onto BG11 medium containing 1% agar (w/v) and excited at 488 nm. Fluorescence images were taken by detecting the emission from phycobilisomes and chlorophyll a at 660–700 nm and from chlorophyll f at 720–750 nm. CLSM lambda-scans were obtained by collecting the emission from 550 to 800 nm with 3 nm steps and 5 nm bandwidth. Images were analyzed with Leica LAS X (version 3.5.6) and FIJI [ 41 ]. Spectral analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook (version 6) running Python 3. Pigment analysis Pigments were extracted and analyzed by HPLC using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Samples were run on a Supelco Discovery HS C18 column (5 μm particle size, 120 Å pore size, 250 × 4.6 mm) at 1 ml·min –1 and 40 ˚C. Solvent A was 64:16:20 (v/v/v) methanol:acetone:H 2 O, while solvent B was 80:20 (v/v) methanol:acetone. Solvent B was held at 50% for the first 2 min, increased linearly to 100% over 10 min, and was held there for 25 min. Elution of chlorophylls a , d , and f was detected by monitoring absorbance at 665, 696, and 705 nm, respectively. DNA extraction and quantification Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research), with a longer bead-beating time (20 min). DNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop spectrometer or a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplification of marker genes The ability of strains for FaRLiP was assessed by amplifying the far-red specific marker gene apcE2 by PCR from genomic DNA. This has been previously shown to be a simple, reliable assay in a wide variety of species [ 22 , 42 ]. Two additional primer sets were used for the amplification of 16S rRNA gene and for the hypervariable intergenic sequence (ITS) between the 16S and 23 S rRNA genes. The PCR and extraction protocol used was the same as published before, with 25 ng gDNA per 25 µl reaction [ 22 ]. The amplicons obtained were sequenced (Microsynth Seqlab). For apcE2 amplicons in particular, 5ʹ tags were used as sequencing primers. All primers are listed in the Supplementary Material (Table S2) . Single-gene phylogenies and rooting In addition to the amplicons obtained above, 16S rRNA and apcE2 gene sequences were also recovered from NCBI [ 43 , 44 ]. Search settings for apcE2 : BLASTp (nr database) and tBLASTn (WGS database, “cyanobacteria”). Search settings for 16S rRNA genes: BLASTn, nr, 1000 results. Query: 16S rRNA of Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT using Jalview [ 45 , 46 ]. Phylogenies were built with RaxML on the CIPRES webserver [ 47 , 48 ]. Settings: RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE, model GTR CAT, bootstrap iterations 100. Trees were edited with iTOL [ 49 ] and Inkscape 0.92. For the graphical abstract, BioRender was used. Networks were built with Splitstree for alternative visualization [ 50 ]. Large branches with uncertain labels (e.g. “uncultured bacterium”), or outside the scope of this study, were removed. So were 16 rRNA genes showing high similarity to Chroococcidiopsis sequences, and assumed to be close relatives in previous work [ 38 ], but revealed by genome phylogenies to be distantly related [ 36 ]. “ Chroococcidiopsis ” sequences belonging to different orders were also largely filtered out (Table S8 ). Additional divergent sequences, including partial sequences (700 nt) were recovered through BLAST searches, for a total alignment length of 1284 ± 169 bp. For the apcE2 phylogeny, the root point was confirmed with Minimal Ancestral Deviation (MAD) [ 51 ] and previous work [ 22 ]. For the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, rooting was done with Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327 as an outgroup. This strain is capable of FaRLiP, and branches out from just outside the group containing the Chroococcidiopsidales together with their closest relatives, the Nostocales [ 24 , 36 ]. Except for the position of the Nostocales as an artifact in 16S rRNA gene trees, the branching pattern closely mirrored the genome tree and was therefore regarded as overall more accurate [ 36 ]. Using either Nostocales or Gloeobacter as an outgroup significantly changed this branching pattern, and was therefore considered less accurate. Previous work also shows this branching instability [ 15 , 35 , 37 , 38 , 52 ]. Sequence comparison of 16S rRNA genes Simple sequence similarity can be a useful phylogenetic proxy. The 16S rRNA genes were aligned with MUSCLE in a ClustalW format [ 53 ]. The output was submitted to Clustal Omega in order to generate a percentage identity matrix (PIM) [ 54 ]. The matrix was parsed and statistics calculated with Python 3.7 using PyCharm (modules: pandas, statistics) [ 55 ]. RNA structure prediction D1-D1’ and Box B loop structures from the ITS were predicted by running SPOT-RNA on a Linux server [ 56 ]. This included non-canonical base pairs/pseudoknots stabilized by tertiary interactions. Results were cross-checked with Mfold and RNA-fold [ 57 , 58 ]. Genome data sourcing: sequencing and assembly Based on their phylogenetic position, Chroococcidiopsis sp. SAG 39.79, SAG 2023, SAG 2025, and Chroococcopsis gigantea SAG 12.99 were sequenced using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Table S3 ). Samples were sequenced according to vendor protocols on a MiSeq and MinION (MinKNOW version 1.10.23), the former using Nextera XT v2 and the latter a R9.4.1 flowcell with base-calling via Albacore (version 2.1.7). In addition to these samples, a metagenomic dataset from the Atacama Desert (NCBI codes SRR2394720 and SRR2396013), associated with ignimbrite rock, was reassembled. Its sourcing is described in the following section. Trimming and quality control was performed with BBDuk (settings: qtrim=r trimq=10 minlen=30 ktrim=r k = 23 mink=11 hdist=1 tpe tbo) [ 59 ]. Assembly was executed for each individual sample with MEGAHIT (settings: meta-sensitive, paired) [ 60 ] for the metagenome, and the hybrid assembler Unicycler for the cultured strains [ 61 ]. Samples were co-binned with vamb [ 62 ]. CheckM, Prokka, and the BBMap statswrapper module were used to estimate bin quality after refinement with anvi’o [ 59 , 63 , 64 , 65 ]. The SAG 39.79 assembly was further improved with LongStitch (settings: tigmint-ntLink-arks) [ 66 ]. Genome-level analyses Besides the locally sequenced samples, genomes were recovered by genus name, as well as by BLAST searches [ 43 ]. For clades with little to no representation, four additional metagenome bins were obtained: “ignimbrite12”, “ignimbrite01”, “Atacama+Negev” and “mojave”. The first two are associated with samples from the Atacama Desert (Fig. S3 ) [ 67 ]. Their raw data was shown to contain apcE2 fragments corresponding to Chroococcidiopsidales in a previous study using SearchSRA for data mining [ 22 , 68 ]. Bin “Atacama+Negev” was identified from the literature as Chroococcidiopsis [ 16 ], and confirmed with a genome tree. It is representative for three near-identical FaRLiP endolithic bins from the Atacama and Negev deserts (IMG/MER bin used 3300037877_1; similar bins 3300039401_1 and 3300039404_1) [ 16 ]. Bin ‘mojave’ was originally sampled from the Mojave desert, and recovered with IMG/MER’s 16S rRNA-based BLAST search (original IMG/MER bin ID 3300034134_4; permission granted by Kirsten Fisher from California State University, USA) [ 69 ]. The genome phylogeny was built with OrthoFinder, and included 13 strains which belong to the Chroococcidiopsidales [ 70 ]. Orthofinder uses proteome inputs; where not already available, these were obtained from genomic sequences with Prokka [ 65 ]. Despite the different genus name, both the 16S rRNA gene and the genome labeled Scytonema millei VB511283 (JTJC00000000.3) clustered with Chroococcidiopsis strains. To identify clade-specific genes, the genomes and metagenome bins were submitted to OrthoVenn2 [ 71 ]. Datasets chosen as representatives for their respective clades: Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7428, Aliterella atlantica CENA595, the original ignimbrite12 metagenome, the mislabeled Scytonema millei VB511283, Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCALA 051, Chroococcales cyanobacterium IPPAS B-1203, Mojave metagenome. As ignimbrite12 was the only representative of its clade, clade-specific genes were approximated by dataset-specific genes. Default settings. The orthologue sets recovered were submitted to BlastKOALA and KofamKOALA on the KEGG webserver [ 72 , 73 ], with KEGG Mapper enabling a better understanding of genus-specific functional pathways [ 74 ]. Environment classification Desert environments were classified into hot and cold depending on the main reason for their aridity: evaporation or low temperatures, respectively [ 5 ]. This has been typically used in cyanobacterial work [ 15 ]. Equivalents in the Köppen–Geiger climatic scheme: Bwh for hot deserts, and ET (polar or alpine) for cold deserts [ 75 ]. For the purposes of this study, the mild Atacama Desert was considered ‘hot’. In addition, a subset of hot deserts with large seasonal variations, where average monthly temperatures might drop below 0° C, were additionally labeled “hot-and-cold” [ 76 ]. This category also included sampling sites from unspecified deserts. For 16S rRNA genes, all NCBI metadata was considered, together with citing literature when necessary / available. Results and discussion Red-shifted chlorophylls d and f are extensively present in the genus Chroococcidiopsis A broad range of 43 samples labeled as Chroococcidiopsis were obtained from culture collections. These strains are representative of either non-extreme environments (19) or deserts (20 from hot deserts, 4 from cold deserts) (Table S1 ). The strains were tested for their ability the perform FaRLiP by using a combination of molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical methods. A first screening approach was performed by PCR for the FaRLiP marker gene apcE2 (Table S2 ). This gene has always and exclusively been found co-occurring with chlF ( psbA4 ), the gene encoding the chlorophyll f synthase [ 22 ]. Out of the 43 tested strains, 22 were positive for the presence of apcE2 . A phylogenetic tree was built with the amino acid sequences encoded by these 22 apcE2 genes, together with homologs recovered from the NCBI. The ApcE2 phylogeny is split into two main branches (Fig. 1A : I and II). The majority of sequences fall in group I, and are associated with a narrow definition of Chroococcidiopsis around the type strain Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 (hereafter referred to as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto ). These strains have been largely sampled from non-extreme environments (Fig. 1B ). However, sequences for “ Chroococcidiopsis’ CCMEE 10, CCMEE 130, and ignimbrite12 (a metagenomics sequence from ignimbrite rock in the Atacama Desert) are clearly divergent from the others (Fig. 1A : II). These strains have been sampled from hot deserts and appear to belong to a different genus, yet to be defined. Fig. 1: Distribution of FaRLiP in the order Chroococcidiopsidales . A Phylogeny of ApcE2 marker sequences from Chroococcidopsis strains, or strains previously classified as such. Bullet points mark full-length proteins. There is a clear split between two branches, I and II, with the largest one (I) associated with Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto . Type species Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 is listed in bold. B Distribution of FaRLiP in the genus Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I). The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny includes strains which tested positive for apcE2 and/or strains with a known FaRLiP cluster (red). Most of them also survived under far-red light, except for a minority of non-axenic strains (CCALA 44, 47, 51, 52, 927). One strain tested negative for apcE2 and did not survive under FRL (black square). HPLC data showed the presence of chlorophylls d and f (circles) or only chlorophyll f , as reported in previous studies (triangles). Trees built with RaxML. Bootstrap values < 30 not shown. Full size image The ApcE2 phylogeny (Fig. 1A ) matches the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 1B ), the genome tree discussed later, as well as a higher-resolution Chroococcidiopsis tree based on MALDI-TOF data [ 20 ]. These results are consistent with vertical descent driving the distribution of FaRLiP within this genus, as opposed to horizontal gene transfer as has previously been suggested for this phenotype [ 24 ]. As the apcE2 gene is an indirect, though fast marker for FaRLiP [ 22 ], additional methods were used to assess the cellular response. These included monitoring the long-term survival of the strains under far-red light (as judged by pigmentation), recording fluorescence emission spectra and determining pigment composition by HPLC. Out of the 22 apcE2 -positive strains, 18 strains were selected for further analyses as representative of phylogenetic and environmental variation. Out of these, 13 strains survived in far-red light (Table S1 ). They included 11 strains from group I and 2 from group II. The remaining 5 cultures (group I) showed abundant non-cyanobacterial growth, which likely outcompeted the cyanobacteria under the test conditions. FaRLiP is a slow process, taking 12-14 days for full acclimation, during which cyanobacteria do not grow [ 77 ]. None of the 8 apcE2 -negative strains tested survived these conditions. To accurately distinguish the FaRLiP cyanobacterial cells from contaminants on a single-cell level, we recorded fluorescence emission spectra using confocal microscopy. All strains surviving in far-red light showed emission peaks that indicated the presence of red-shifted chlorophylls in the photosystems (Fig. 2 , or S1 for full results). The chlorophylls involved extend the emission range to 720–750 nm, in addition to the commonly found fluorescence attributed to chlorophyll a and phycobilisomes in the range of 640–700 nm at room temperature. This response is specific to far-red light and it does not occur under standard, white-light conditions [ 24 ]. As confocal microscopy is unable to identify the specific pigments, HPLC analysis was performed on a subset of 9 strains from groups I and II that were phylogenetically representative and exhibited low contamination levels. Fig. 2: Far-Red Light Photoacclimation in the Chroococcidiopsidales . The synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls and their incorporation into photosystems can be seen in confocal micrographs (left). In addition to florescence emission from chlorophyll a and phycobilisomes (magenta, 660–700 nm), there is emission from chlorophyll f (yellow, 720–750 nm). Rightmost micrographs mark the overlay of both channels. Excitation, 488 nm. Scale bar, 10 µm. Spectral characteristics can be also observed through a fluorescence emission scan, with the aforementioned channels highlighted (second column from the right). Y-axis: Intensity (a.u.). Composite graph for a minimum of 3 cells. Pigments were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (right). Absorbance traces at 696 nm are shown, indicating the presence of chlorophyll d (16.3 min), f (16.7 min) and a (19.0 min). Full size image All of the HPLC-tested strains contained chlorophylls a , d , and f when cultured under far-red light (Fig. 2 , Table S1 ). Chromatogram peaks were visually consistent with the published percentages of approx. 90% chl a , 9% chl f and 1% chl d of the chlorophyll content [ 24 ]. Chlorophylls d and f were always observed in HPLC data for samples that showed a red-shifted fluorescence peak under far-red light, and these peaks were always observed for samples containing these red-shifted chlorophylls (Fig. 2 ). It has been shown that chlorophyll f is essential for FaRLiP [ 24 ], and the trace pigment chlorophyll d has been reported from the majority of strains undergoing this process [ 27 ]. However, the literature is divided on the significance of the latter. Some strains appear to lack chlorophyll d [ 21 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ], including Chroococcidiopsis strains from a subtropical forest [ 21 ]. These strains are 98.2-100% similar in 16S rRNA sequence to ours [ 21 , 23 ]. All of our phylogenetically diverse samples contained chlorophyll d (Fig. 1B ). This is consistent with previous studies indicating that Photosystem II (PSII) from far-red grown FaRLiP cyanobacteria contain a single chlorophyll d pigment in the reaction center, including in the type strain Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 [ 23 , 29 ]. Since the amount of PSII per cell is known to vary depending on growth conditions [ 78 ], the detection of chlorophyll d might thus be more difficult under certain conditions and explain its apparent absence in some cases. Therefore, we suggest that having one chlorophyll d per PSII may be a conserved attribute of all FaRLiP strains. Future studies could consider growth phase in their chlorophyll d pigment analyses. Overall, it is clear that the capacity for FaRLiP is correlated with the phylogenetic lineage. Specifically, within Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), all but one of 24 strains (96%), tested positive for chlorophyll f synthesis via multiple methods (marker gene presence, confocal microscopy, HPLC) (Fig. 1 ). In contrast, in lineage II, the majority of strains (18, or 73%) tested negative for chlorophyll f (Fig. S2 ). Out of 24 desert strains tested, only 3 were positive, belonging to lineage II. This seemingly contradicted our initial expectation that extreme endolithic environments would be enriched in FaRLiP cyanobacteria. Therefore, in order to investigate the connection between FaRLiP and habitat, and whether this is influenced by phylogenetic history, we set out to understand phylogenetic groupings within the Chroococcidiopsidales , and the adaptive niches they may be associated with. Improved phylogeny of the order Chroococcidiopsidales Triggered by the observed divergence in the ApcE2 tree (Fig. 1A ), a 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 3 ) and a sequence similarity network (Fig. S3 ) were built to better understand the evolutionary history of the order Chroococcidiopsidales . Trees based on 16S rRNA genes carry limited phylogenetic information and are therefore prone to issues such as unreliable branching patterns, polyphyly, and/or mislabeling. In contrast to them, genome-level phylogenies are less sensitive to noise, but full genomes are available for far fewer strains [ 36 , 40 ]. This study took advantage of both methods, by building a genome phylogeny (Fig. 3B ) and using it to correct and interpret the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 3A ). Fig. 3: Phylogenetic history of the Chroococcidiopsidales order. Phylogenetic trees of the Chroococcidiopsidales order based on 16S rRNA genes ( A ) and genome information ( B ). The two trees mirror and complement each other. In ( A ), it can be seen that the genus ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’ is currently polyphyletic. Strains identified as such actually belong to multiple clades, some of which may be highly supported, but whose relationships with each other is sometimes unclear. Large, highly supported clades and/or clades with type species have been collapsed. Each color represents a genus-level taxon, some with associated genome information ( B ). These taxa include well-defined genera such as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), Sinocapsa (IV), Aliterella (VI), Haliplanktos (VII) and Pseudocyanosarcina (VIII). They also encompass yet-undefined genera lacking a type species—Hot desert Chroococcidiopsi dales (II) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V). Moreover, ‘ Gloeocapsa ’ (III) represents a cluster of taxonomically ambiguous, closely related strains ( Gloeocapsa , Gloeocapsopsis , Chroogloeocystis and Speleotes ). Although showing low support in this tree, the Sinocapsa (IV) branch is stable across multiple tree-building methods. The related Nostocales are indicated by a gray rectangle (see “Materials and Methods”: Single-gene phylogenies and rooting). The tree was rooted with Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, another FaRLiP strain, as an outgroup. Full size image The resulting Chroococcidiopsidales genome tree covered a diversity of lineages, by combining publicly available NCBI data (12 genomes), metagenome bins (3) and locally sequenced strains (2). Of the latter, Chroococcidiopsis sp. SAG 2025 was sequenced to the level of a complete, circularized genome (Table S3 ). Combining our trees with other recent work, showed six highly supported clades (III-VIII) besides the two already mentioned (I-II) (Fig. 3 ; See Figs. S2 , S4 – S8 for individual trees) [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]. These include five genera, such as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), Sinocapsa (IV), Aliterella (previously ‘Cold desert Chroococcidiopsis ’) (VI), Haliplanktos (VII) Pseudocyanosarcina (VIII), and the two additional taxa ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales ’ (previously ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsis ’) (II) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V). One extra clade is represented by a monophyletic cluster of genera related to Gloeocapsa (III), with >95% similarity between 16S rRNA gene sequences. Because the taxonomy of Gloeocapsa -related strains requires revision (Fig. S4 ), for the purposes of this paper they will be discussed together. All of these clades, including those yet to be described, are likely equivalent to genera. This can be seen from 16S rRNA gene similarities (>95% within clades) (Table S4 ) [ 79 ], from the shape of D1-D1’ (Fig. S9 ) and Box-B loops of the rRNA operon’s hypervariable region (Fig. S10 ), from shared genes (Fig. S11 ), as well as metadata. For ease of cross-referencing, names used in previous publications were collated (Table S5 ). Although it was noted as a possibility from an early landmark paper [ 80 ], polyphyly within Chroococcidiopsis has been insufficiently acknowledged in the literature [ 15 , 19 ]. This can lead to biased assumptions in comparative microbiological studies, which can propagate through later research. For example, a model organism used for cryo-EM studies of Photosystem I is Chroococcidiopsis sp. TS-821 [ 81 ], which we show actually belongs to ‘Gloeocapsa’ (III) (Fig. 3 ). Awareness of ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’ diversity grew in recent years through the introduction of genera such as Aliterella and Sinocapsa [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]. Our work highlights two additional genus-level clades (II and V) which have been commonly mislabeled as ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’. The present phylogeny considers all the data available (16S rRNA genes, genomes, MAGs) to produce a state-of-the-art understanding of evolutionary relationships within the Chroococcidiopsidales , and assist further research on this order. FaRLiP within the Chroococcidiopsidales is common to generalists, not specialists By recovering sampling location data, many clades could be associated with particular (micro)environments, and were therefore defined as ‘specialists’ (Fig. 4 ). The majority of strains in specialist clades do not appear to have FaRLiP, indicative of gene loss. FaRLiP-lacking clades include ‘ Gloeocapsa ’ (III), which is strongly associated with hot spring or saline environments (Supplementary Text 1 ), and Aliterella (VI) which appears linked to cold deserts, such as polar and alpine regions (Supplementary Text 2 ). Fig. 4: Environmental preferences within Chroococcidiopsidales lineages. This figure considers the temperature/humidity of the original sampling sites (inside row), as well as the capacity to utilize far-red light (outside row). Lineages are listed on the tree branches. Lineage II appears to be highly specialized to living in hot deserts. In contrast, Aliterella (VI) sequences have often found in cold deserts. Gloeocapsa and related strains (III) are characteristic of hot springs, while Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I) appears to have a wider distribution. Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto is the largest of the clades recovered, and it is strongly associated with the ability to perform FaRLiP. FaRLiP capacity was assessed by combining experimental and genome data. Strains listed as positive survived under far-red light and / or carried the entire FaRLiP gene cluster. Negative strains did not survive under far-red light, failing the apcE2 PCR assay, and / or lacked the gene within a complete genome. Tree built with RaxML. An extended version with labels can be accessed at https://itol.embl.de/tree/1301336668200071662129117 . Full size image In specialist lineage II, only 3 out of the 18 tested strains proved capable of FaRLiP. We defined this clade as ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales ’. Out of 35 available 16S rRNA gene sequences, 33 were recovered from hypo-/endolithic niches in hot deserts (Fig. 4 , S2 ). Adaptations to extremophilic life have been documented by considerable laboratory work (Supplementary Text 3 ) [ 15 , 19 ]. The three FaRLiP strains are CCMEE 10, 12 and 130, with the first two identical in 16S rRNA gene sequences. Out of them, CCMEE 10 has been recently shown to only carry a partial, though functional, FaRLiP cluster, lacking Photosystem I genes [ 42 ]. The partial or total loss of FaRLiP genes seems surprising given that these strains are found in far-red light enriched habitats. It is possible that living in stable, extreme environments may result in less competition for light, leading to gene loss. Although gene loss in this phylum has been mainly studied in the highly reduced genomes of marine picocyanobacteria, the environmental stability hypothesized to underpin this genome optimization [ 36 ] might also apply to deserts. The majority of FaRLiP-positive strains in this study fall under the classification of Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I) (Fig. 4 , Table S6 ). All but one of the tested strains in this genus were FaRLiP-positive. Considerable support exists for FaRLiP in this group, as the genus included most of the genomes, sequences and strains recovered. Strains within Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto can be defined as generalists, as they appear to inhabit highly diverse environments. They have been found in freshwater, saltwater, as well as in dry soil and on rocks. However, they have only rarely been identified in hyperarid areas, unlike the closely related clade II, Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales . Therefore, in contrast to the generally held view, they appear to be generalists with limited extremotolerance potential, supported by field and laboratory studies [ 16 , 19 ]. Genome comparisons suggest that, in contrast to related genera, they may carry a conserved group of genes associated with hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Text 4 ). We hypothesize that these genes could have been co-selected, together with FaRLiP, for living in shaded environments such as soil or microbial mats. These widespread generalist strains have mostly been underrepresented in discussions of Chroococcidiopsis phylogenetic history. Yet, not only do they form their own clade, but it is the largest among the known Chroococcidiopsidales . While this might be partially explained by sampling bias (non-extreme environments may be easier to sample), these strains appear to be extremely successful. They live in highly diverse environments, unlike those in extremophile genera. This might be due to higher competition, predation and many additional challenges in these moderate environments that are difficult to discern but shape evolution as much as the more obvious abiotic factors [ 82 ]. Not all lineages observed in this study were as straightforward to investigate as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto . No genomes, and very few strains, were available for clades IV-V and VII-VIII. Therefore, we were unable to assess their FaRLiP capacity. Regarding environments, for Sinocapsa (IV) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V), there were at least sufficient 16S rRNA gene sequences available with associated metadata to suggest that these groups may be extremotolerant (Fig. 4 ). The latter group included sequences sampled a wide variety of desert environments (Utah, Tibet, Atacama). For groups VII-VIII, there were few sequences available, and no inferences could be made. This study relied on recovering sampling locations from 16S rRNA datasets to balance out the limited strain availability. It proved particularly valuable for taxonomic groups for which cultured strains are rare, difficult to obtain/grow (as is the case with many polar microbes) or labeled with varying accuracy. It also allowed for correction of previous assumptions about prokaryote dispersal. Likely due to limited data, Chroococcidiopsis -related lineages have long been considered to be largely constrained to specific continents [ 15 ]. The present study, supported by additional work [ 12 ], contradicts this, showing that gene flow occurs frequently. Although nearby sampling locations may share closely related strains (sequences with >99% identity from similar locations were trimmed in our study) [ 15 ], this does not scale at higher taxonomic or geographic levels. For example, within a small branch of the Aliterella 16S rRNA gene tree, there are sequences from four continents, in no particular pattern. This is especially remarkable for extremophile clades, as deserts have been described functionally as “islands” [ 15 ]. Yet widespread geographic dispersal undoubtedly also plays a significant role for generalists, as they encounter diverse environments where survival may involve relying on various acclimation processes, such as FaRLiP. Conclusion Chroococcidiopsis has been previously defined as an extremophile cyanobacterium. However, many of the strains known under this name form separate genera. Some of them are specialists adapted to extreme environments such as hot or cold deserts; others are generalists. By combining bioinformatics data mining with large-scale laboratory assays, we have been able to connect genes, genomes, environments and adaptations. FaRLiP has been inherited from a common ancestor, and it remains near-universal in Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto , a generalist genus. However, it has been commonly lost in specialist extremophile genera. It may have been co-selected with genes for hypoxic environments. Chlorophyll d was present in all our FaRLiP samples, supporting its predicted significant role in FaRLiP.

Photo by Mike Tate, Kansas Department of Health and Environment, Bureau of Water, Technical Services Section Specific Indicators Documented Nutrient Pollution Nutrient loads and yields Fertilizer Manure Documented Impacts Hypoxia Harmful algal toxins Groundwater nitrate Assessed and impaired waters State Actions Underway Limiting loads (Status of Nutrient Requirements for NPDES-Permitted Facilities) Adoption of standards Nutrient Indicators Dataset Home About this indicator One of the potential effects of excess nutrients in lakes is the overgrowth of cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, which produce toxins (cyanotoxins) that are harmful to people’s health and can kill fish, mammals and birds. When the density of such harmful organisms leads to the presence of scum on the lake surface or discoloration of the water, they are known as harmful algal blooms (HABs). The frequency and severity of HABs has been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities (Lopez et al . 2008), and cyanobacterial HABs are considered one of the clearest indicators of excess nutrient concentrations (Paerl and Fulton, 2006). Cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins (nervous system), hepatotoxins (liver) and dermatoxins (skin), posing a threat to human health when blooms occur in drinking water supplies. Additionally, cyanotoxins in recreational waters can pose a danger to people, pets, and livestock when they come in contact with the water. The data presented here pertain to microcystins, and not other algae which may produce toxins. The data for this indicator are the number of lake visits sampled per state for microcystins during EPA’s 2017 National Lakes Assessment, and the number of samples which contained greater than EPA’s national recommended human health recreational criterion of 8 µg/l. When applied as a Clean Water Act section 304(a) water quality criterion, EPA recommends no more than 3 excursions (10-day assessment periods) within a recreational season per year. When used as a swimming advisory, EPA recommends the value not be exceeded on any single day. Number of state lake visits sampled for microcystins and the number of samples which contained greater than 8 µg/l of microcystins.

In this study, EPA conducted a national survey of the condition of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, which included sampling for microcystins. Number of lake visits was obtained from table 2-2 in the 2017 National Lakes Assessment Technical Support Document . At each lake site, a sample was taken at a single station located at the deepest point in the lake, which would be expected to minimize the chance for false positives. Users may download the report and all the raw data directly from EPA’s National Lakes Assessment website Data from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys from the table entitled “National Aquatic Resource Surveys Data.” What to consider when using these data The lakes sampled for the 2017 National Lakes Assessment were chosen in a random, probability-based manner. However, while the base funding for the survey provided for the sampling of enough sites to make national and regional scale estimates of lake conditions, most states could not sample enough sites to allow for generation of state-level estimates. Therefore, the data shown here should not be extrapolated to make state-wide estimates of the percent of lakes presenting risk of exposure to microcystins. Users should also consider that the lake samples were collected for the survey at particular times during the summer of 2017, and the levels of microcystins are affected by spatial, temporal and climatic variables, such as season, temperature, and level of precipitation. Future assessments will continue to inform on the risk of exposure in different parts of the country. References and links to other data sources Graham, J.L., Loftin, K.A., and Kamman, N. 2009.

To develop a sustainable animal cell culture system, we aimed to study the consumption of l -lactate using a photosynthetic microorganism. As genes involved in l -lactate utilization were not found in most cyanobacteria and microalgae, we introduced the NAD-independent l -lactate dehydrogenase gene from Escherichia coli ( lldD ) into Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. The lldD -expressing strain consumed l -lactate added to basal medium. This consumption was accelerated by expression of a lactate permease gene from E. coli ( lldP ) and an increase in culture temperature. Intracellular levels of acetyl-CoA, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and malate, and extracellular levels of 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and malate, increased during l -lactate utilization, suggesting that the metabolic flux from l -lactate was distributed toward the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This study provides a perspective on l -lactate treatment by photosynthetic microorganisms, which would increase the feasibility of animal cell culture industries.

Hann, Sean Overa, … Robert E. Jinkerson Introduction Cultured animal cells are valuable in industries such as biopharmaceutical production 1 , 2 . Cultured meat production has also been studied, in which only edible parts are produced by cultured animal cells 3 , 4 . To produce nutrients for animal cells (e.g. sugars and amino acids), photosynthetic microorganisms (i.e. prokaryotic cyanobacteria and eukaryotic microalgae) have been recently studied because of their high ability to produce biomass from atmospheric CO 2 5 . Mouse C2C12 myoblasts and primary bovine myoblasts have been successfully cultured using cell extracts from Chlorella vulgaris , Chlorococcum littorale , and Arthrospira platensis as nutrients 6 , 7 . Thus, by treating waste compounds from animal cells (such as ammonium and l -lactate) using a photosynthetic microorganism, a sustainable animal cell culture system, that is, a circular cell culture (CCC) system, can be developed 8 (Fig. 1 ). Consumption of ammonium in the culture waste of C2C12 cells has already been achieved through the cultivation of C. vulgaris and C. littorale 9 . The potential application of the CCC system was previously shown using C. littorale , RL34 hepatocytes, and C2C12 myoblasts as producers of nutrients, growth factors, and muscles, respectively 8 . However, l -lactate consumption by photosynthetic microorganisms has not yet been investigated. l -Lactate is a major waste compound in cultured animal cells, and its accumulation in medium causes cytotoxic effects by changing the pH and osmolarity 10 . Therefore, l -lactate removal is a ubiquitous requirement in industries that utilize cultured animal cells and is necessary for optimal functioning of the CCC system. Figure 1 Scheme of circular cell culture (CCC). Full size image Cyanobacteria such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 harbor d -lactate dehydrogenase ( d -LDH; EC 1.1.1.28) as an enzyme involved in lactate metabolism and can produce d -lactate 11 , 12 (Fig. 2 ). The genetically engineered strains of PCC 6803 into which NAD-dependent l -lactate dehydrogenase ( l -nLDH, EC 1.1.1.27) has been introduced can also produce l -lactate 13 . However, the ability of microalgae and cyanobacteria to consume l -/ d -lactate remains unclear. Several heterotrophic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli , Corynebacterium glutamicum , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa , can utilize l -lactate with the help of NAD-independent l -lactate dehydrogenase ( l -iLDH, EC 1.1.2.3), which catalyzes the conversion of l -lactate into pyruvate 14 , 15 , 16 . For example, E. coli harbors the lactate operon, which is composed of the lldD ( l -iLDH) and lldP (lactate permease) genes for l -lactate utilization as well as the lldR (regulatory protein) gene 14 . Figure 2 Enzymes involved in l -lactate metabolism. Full size image The present study aimed to develop a method for l -lactate consumption using a photosynthetic microorganism. Most cyanobacteria and microalgae do not possess genes for l -lactate metabolism and cannot utilize l -lactate. Therefore, the ability for l -lactate utilization was added to PCC 7002 by heterogeneous expression of the lldD and lldP genes from E. coli . The distribution of metabolic flux derived from l -lactate was determined through metabolome analysis. This study provides a perspective on l -lactate treatment by photosynthetic microorganisms and establishes a method to develop cyanobacteria with the ability to utilize l -lactate. These findings will be valuable to industries using animal cell cultures and would increase the feasibility of the CCC system. Results and discussion l -Lactate utilization ability of cyanobacteria and microalgae in nature l -Lactate has cytotoxic effects on animal cells 10 . In the present study, C2C12 cells were examined, and addition of l -lactate higher than 20 mM significantly decreased cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). To achieve a sustainable CCC system 8 (Fig. 1 ), we aimed to develop a method for l -lactate consumption using a photosynthetic microorganism. The conservation of genes involved in l -lactate metabolism was first investigated in silico to examine the l -lactate utilization ability of photosynthetic microorganisms in nature (Fig. 2 ). In this investigation, cyanobacteria and microalgae harboring l -iLDH (EC 1.1.2.3), l -lactate oxidase (LOX, EC 1.1.3.2), or lactate 2-monoxygenase (LMO, EC 1.13.12.4) genes were identified using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database 17 . l -iLDH and LOX convert l -lactate into pyruvate, and LMO converts l -lactate into acetate 18 . In contrast, l -nLDH (EC 1.1.1.27) synthesizes l -lactate from pyruvate reversibly or irreversibly 19 . Therefore, cyanobacteria and microalgae harboring LOX and LMO genes were not found. In addition, the l -iLDH gene is absent in most cyanobacteria and microalgae, except Aureococcus anophagefferens 20 , Crocosphaera watsonii 21 , Trichodesmium erythraeum 22 , and Rivularia sp. 23 , among which A. anophagefferens and T. erythraeum are known to cause harmful algal blooms. Thus, the present study found that l -lactate utilization genes are absent in most cyanobacteria and microalgae. To experimentally examine the l -lactate utilization ability, several cyanobacteria and microalgae, i.e. Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 24 , Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 25 , Arthrospira platensis NIES-39 26 , Chlamydomonas sp. KOR1 27 , and Pavlova sp. OPMS 30543 28 , were cultured phototrophically in the presence of l -lactate. The growth of these cyanobacteria and microalgae, except for PCC 7120, was not suppressed by 20 mM l -lactate, which is nearly equivalent to the culture waste of animal cells. However, lactate concentration in the medium did not change during cultivation (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). These results suggest that few cyanobacteria and microalgae species in nature can utilize l -lactate. Therefore, genetic engineering should be a suitable approach for creating photosynthetic microorganisms capable of utilizing l -lactate. Genetic engineering of cyanobacteria for l -lactate utilization To develop photosynthetic microorganisms capable of l -lactate utilization, this study introduced heterogenous genes into the marine cyanobacterium PCC 7002, which is tolerant to salinity of animal medium. Because several heterotrophic bacteria can grow using l -lactate due to l -iLDH 14 , 15 , 16 , the present study employed l -iLDH encoded by the E. coli lldD gene. The lldP gene encoding lactate permease was previously shown to improve d -lactate export in cyanobacteria such as PCC 7002 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 12 , 29 , 30 . This study employed the lldP gene to enhance l -lactate uptake. The lldD and lldP genes were expressed in PCC 7002 cells using the constitutive trc promoter (Fig. 3 A). These genetic elements were introduced into the ldhA gene site encoding d -LDH to prevent d -lactate synthesis from pyruvate by the native enzyme. Integration and complete segregation were confirmed using PCR (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Figure 3 Evaluation of the lldD / lldP -expressing cyanobacteria. ( A ) Genetic elements for l -lactate utilization. The ldhA (d-lactate dehydrogenase) gene in the pAQ7 plasmid of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was replaced with the gentamicin resistance cassette (Gm R ) and codon-optimized NAD-independent l-lactate dehydrogenase ( lldD ) and lactate permease ( lldP ) genes from Escherichia coli . The lldD and lldP genes were constitutively expressed in the trc promoter region. The black boxes indicate homologous sequences used to introduce these genetic elements into the ldhA gene site. ( B , C ) Comparison of the lldD / lldP -expressing strains. Cyanobacteria were phototrophically cultured in the presence of 20 mM l -lactate, and the dry cell weight (DCW)-based biomass concentrations ( B ) and lactate concentration in the medium ( C ) were investigated. ( D , E ) Influence of temperature on l -lactate utilization. The cyanobacteria expressing both lldD and lldP were phototrophically cultured in the presence of 20 mM l -lactate at 30–40 °C, and DCW-based biomass concentrations ( D ) and lactate concentration in the medium ( E ) were investigated. Error bars indicate standard deviation of three replicate experiments. Full size image To evaluate the l -lactate utilization ability, PCC 7002 and the recombinant strains were phototrophically cultured in the presence of 20 mM l -lactate. During the early stage of cultivation, the recombinant strains showed more enhanced cell growth than PCC 7002 (Fig. 3 B). l -lactate concentration in the medium significantly decreased in the lldD -expressing strain, while it remained unchanged in PCC 7002 (Fig. 3 C). Additional introduction of the lldP gene enhanced l -lactate consumption by the lldD -expressing strain, and as a result, 20 mM (1.8 g·L −1 ) of l -lactate was completely consumed in 9 days. Thus, the l -lactate utilization ability was successfully added to PCC 7002 using the lldD / lldP genes. These results indicate that both LldD and LldP proteins were functional in cyanobacteria and that lldP can contribute to l -lactate import. To accelerate l -lactate consumption, the culture temperature of the lldD / lldP -expressing strain was examined. During the initial 4 days, biomass concentration was not significantly different at 30–40 °C (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, higher temperatures resulted in higher l -lactate consumption, and 20 mM l -lactate was completely consumed in 7 days at 35–40 °C (Fig. 3 E). This result indicates that l -lactate utilization by the lldD / lldP -expressing strain can be enhanced by elevated temperatures probably because this temperature range is suitable for these E. coli enzymes. Thus, we established a method to develop cyanobacteria with the l -lactate utilization ability. Addition of a functional l -iLDH would also be valuable in adding l -lactate utilization ability to microalgae. Distribution of metabolic flux from l -lactate In lldD/lldP -expressing cells, pyruvate synthesized by LldD is converted to other metabolites by intrinsic enzymes. To elucidate the distribution of the metabolic flux derived from l -lactate, metabolome analysis of lldD / lldP -expressing cells cultured in the absence and presence of l -lactate was performed. Lactate, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) accumulated in cells when supplemented with l -lactate (Fig. 4 A). In addition, several metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, that is, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG), succinate, and malate, accumulated in the presence of l -lactate. These results indicate that the metabolic flux from l -lactate was largely distributed to the TCA cycle. Figure 4 Metabolome analysis during l -lactate utilization. The lldD / lldP -expressing strain was phototrophically cultured in the absence and presence of 20 mM l -lactate at 30 °C for 7 days. ( A ) Intracellular metabolites in lldD / lldP -expressing cells.

Ru5P ribulose-5-phosphate, RuBP ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, TCA cycle tricarboxylic acid cycle. Full size image A significant intracellular accumulation of these metabolites should trigger their releases from lldD / lldP -expressing cells during l -lactate utilization. By analyzing the metabolites in the culture supernatant, we found that several metabolites increased extracellularly when supplemented with l -lactate (Fig. 4 B). Extracellular levels of pyruvate, 2-OG, succinate, and malate in the lldD / lldP -expressing strain when supplemented with 20 mM l -lactate were 2,021.1, 496.7, 300.6, and 53.3 μM, respectively. The accumulation of intracellular metabolites by l -lactate utilization likely caused a significant release of these organic acids. A similar phenomenon, with elevated release of organic acids such as pyruvate and 2-OG, has been reported in glycogen-deficient cyanobacterial mutants 31 , 32 , 33 . Because 2-OG can be converted into glutamine, which is an essential and abundant amino acid in the medium for mammalian cell cultures 34 , the lldD / lldP -expressing strain may also be valuable for producing amino acids in animal cells. Photosynthetic activity during l -lactate utilization To examine whether the photosynthetic activity of lldD/lldP -expressing cells was affected by l -lactate utilization, the cells were analyzed in the presence and absence of l -lactate. First, O 2 evolution was analyzed on day 3 when the cells performed biomass production and l -lactate utilization (Fig. 3 ). The apparent O 2 evolution rate measured under light conditions significantly decreased in the presence of l -lactate (Fig. 5 A). The O 2 consumption rate was measured in the dark and was found to be significantly increased when l -lactate was supplied to the medium. This might be due to the enhanced metabolic flux of the TCA cycle during l -lactate utilization (Fig. 4 A) as the TCA cycle is the dominant source of NAD(P)H for respiratory electron transport 35 . The net photosynthetic O 2 evolution rate was calculated by subtracting the O 2 consumption rate from the apparent O 2 evolution rate and was found to be almost the same in the presence or absence of l -lactate. Figure 5 Photosynthetic activity during l -lactate utilization. lldD/lldP -expressing cells were phototrophically cultured in the absence and presence of 20 mM l -lactate at 30 °C for 3 days and then subjected to analyses of photosynthetic activity.

Full size image To further examine photosynthetic activity, the CO 2 fixation activity of lldD/lldP -expressing cells was analyzed by in vivo 13 C labeling experiments. NaH 13 CO 3 was added to the medium on day 3 to supply the lldD/lldP -expressing cells with 13 CO 2 . After incubation for 0–20 min, the 13 C fraction of metabolites in the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, which conducts photosynthetic CO 2 fixation by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), was analyzed. The de novo synthesis of 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA), ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P), and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) from CO 2 occurred even in the presence of l -lactate, although the 13 C fraction of 3-PGA was slightly decreased (Fig. 5 B). These results reveal that photosynthesis in the lldD/lldP -expressing cells continued even during l -lactate utilization. In the presence of l -lactate, the de novo synthesis of Ru5P was not changed (Fig. 5 B), while its accumulation significantly increased (Fig. 4 A). These results are contrasting but not necessarily conflicting because these experiments analyzed for distinct metabolic parameters at different time points. The higher growth rate of l -lactate-assimilating cyanobacteria than that of PCC 7002 (Fig. 3 B) might be due to the simultaneous utilization of CO 2 and l -lactate as carbon sources. Thus, this study established a method to consume l -lactate in animal cell cultures using photosynthetic cyanobacteria expressing the heterogenous lldD and lldP genes. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of a sustainable CCC system for the animal cell culture industry. Materials and methods Strains and culture conditions Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 and the recombinant strains were phototrophically cultured in double-deck flasks on a BR-40LF bioshaker (TAITEC, Aichi, Japan). The upper stage of the flasks was supplemented with 70 mL of Medium A2 (8.30 × 10 –3 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, 1.76 × 10 –2 M NaNO 3 , 3.10 × 10 –1 M NaCl, 2.00 × 10 –2 M MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 2.50 × 10 –3 M CaCl 2 ·2H 2 O, 3.70 × 10 –4 M KH 2 PO 4 , 8.10 × 10 –3 M KCl, 8.90 × 10 –5 M Na 2 EDTA·2H 2 O, 3.00 × 10 –5 M FeCl 3 ·6H 2 O, 5.50 × 10 –4 M H 3 BO 3 , 2.20 × 10 –5 M MnCl 2 ·4H 2 O, 2.30 × 10 –6 M ZnCl 2 , 2.10 × 10 –7 M Na 2 MoO 4 ·2H 2 O, 1.20 × 10 –8 M CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O, 5.10 × 10 –8 M CoCl 2 ·6H 2 O, and 3.00 × 10 –9 M vitamin B 12 ), containing 40 mg·L −1 gentamicin when necessary. To investigate l -lactate utilization, 20 mM l -lactate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 20 mM NaOH were added to the medium. The lower stage of the flasks was supplemented with 50 mL of 2 M K 2 CO 3 /KHCO 3 solution, which adjusted the CO 2 gas concentration to 2% ( v/v ). Cells were inoculated at an optical density of 750 nm (OD 750 ) = 0.1 and cultured under continuous illumination with white fluorescent lamps at 100 µmol photons·m −2 ·s −1 at 30 °C with rotary shaking at 100 rpm 24 . Construction of recombinant strains The pUC118-based vectors, harboring the trc promoter and homology arms for the ldhA gene (SYNPCC7002_G0164) in the pAQ7 plasmid of Synechococcus sp., were used to introduce the lldD and lldP genes from E. coli via homologous recombination. The codon-optimized genes of LldD (NP_418062.1) and LldP (NP_418060.1) were prepared by the Genscript gene synthesis service and cloned into the vector using the In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). PCC 7002 was transformed as previously described 24 . Integration and complete segregation were confirmed by PCR using the specific primer pair 5′-AGACATTTCCCACAGACCACATCAAATTA-3′ and 5′-GGATCAATTTACGTCTTTGTTGGCGCA-3′. Measurement of lactate Each culture was centrifuged at 8000× g for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered using a Shim-pack SPR-Pb column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). l -Lactate (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the quantitative standard to determine the lactate concentration using a calibration curve. Metabolome analysis To prepare intracellular metabolites, a culture broth containing cells equivalent to 5 mg dry weight was mixed with four times the volume of 32.5% ( v/v ) methanol pre-cooled at − 30 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 8000× g for 3 min at 4 °C. After complete removal of the supernatant, the cells were washed with 20 mM ammonium carbonate once and immediately resuspended in 1 mL of pre-cooled methanol containing 37.5 μM l -methionine sulfone and 37.5 μM piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) as internal standards. The cell suspension (500 μL) was added to 200 μL ultrapure water and 500 μL chloroform pre-cooled at 4 °C and then vigorously mixed using vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation at 14,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C, the aqueous layer was collected and filtered using an Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit UFC5003BK (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) by centrifugation at 14,000× g at 4 °C. The sample (300 μL) was dried under vacuum using a centrifugal evaporator CEV-3100 (EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) and resuspended in 20 µL of ultrapure water. To prepare extracellular metabolites, the culture was centrifuged at 8000× g for 5 min. The supernatant (500 μL) was mixed with 500 μL chloroform pre-cooled at 4 °C by vortexing. After centrifugation at 14,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C, the upper layer was collected and filtered using UFC5003BK (Merck Millipore) as described above. Next, 400 μM l -methionine sulfone and 400 μM PIPES were added as internal standards. The intracellular and extracellular samples were subjected to capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) using a G7100 CE and G6224AA liquid chromatography-mass selective detector (LC/MSD) TOF system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) 24 . Analysis of photosynthesis Cells were cultivated for 3 days under the conditions described above. To analyze the O 2 evolution rate, cultured cells were harvested, centrifuged at 8000× g for 5 min, and resuspended in fresh Medium A2 with or without 20 mM l -lactate to adjust the cell density to OD 750 = 5.0. The O 2 concentration in the cell suspension was measured using an oxygen electrode (Hansatech, King’s Lynn, UK). During the measurements, the cell suspension was maintained at 30 °C and mixed using a magnetically controlled microstirrer. The O 2 consumption rate of the cells was determined by measuring the O 2 concentration in the dark, while the apparent O 2 evolution rate was determined under illumination with a red LED light (200 μmol photons·m −2 ·s −1 ). The photosynthetic O 2 evolution rate was calculated by subtracting the O 2 consumption rate from the apparent O 2 evolution rate 24 . To investigate carbon fixation from CO 2 , in vivo 13 C labeling of metabolites in the CBB cycle was performed. After 3 d of cultivation, the cell culture was added to 25 mM NaH 13 CO 3 as a carbon source and incubated under illumination with white fluorescent lamps (100 μmol photons·m −2 ·s −1 ). After labeling for 0–20 min, the intracellular metabolites were analyzed as described above 24 . The ratio of 13 C in the total carbon ( 13 C fraction) of the metabolite was determined based on the shifts between the 12 C and 13 C mass spectra. Statistics and reproducibility Data in this study are represented as mean ± standard deviation of three replicate experiments. Statistical significance was determined by Welch’s t test.

Although the bioactive and physicochemical properties of cyanobacterial-based EPS are attractive, their commercial exploitation is limited by the high production costs. Bioprospecting and characterizing novel EPS-producing strains for industrially relevant conditions is key to facilitate their implementation in various biotechnological applications and fields. In the present work, we selected twenty-five Portuguese cyanobacterial strains from a diverse taxonomic range (including some genera studied for the first time) to be grown in diel light and temperature, simulating the Portuguese climate conditions, and evaluated their growth performance and proximal composition of macronutrients. Synechocystis and Cyanobium genera, from marine and freshwater origin, were highlighted as fast-growing (0.1–0.2 g L −1 day −1 ) with distinct biomass composition. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, showed a production of 0.3 and 0.4 g L −1 of released polysaccharides (RPS). These were found to be glucan-based polymers with high molecular weight and a low number of monosaccharides than usually reported for cyanobacterial EPS. In addition, the absence of known cyanotoxins in these two RPS producers was also confirmed. This work provides the initial steps for the development of cyanobacterial EPS bioprocesses under the Portuguese climate.

Peixoto Efficient bubble/precipitate traffic enables stable seawater reduction electrocatalysis at industrial-level current densities Article Open access 05 April 2024 Jie Liang, Zhengwei Cai, … Bo Tang Introduction Cyanobacteria and microalgae are major contributors to the bio-economy by sourcing feedstocks for food, feed, bioenergy, cosmetics and bioplastics 1 . Additionally, significant research & development efforts are leveraging the current industrial production of these photoautotrophic factories into economically feasible applications 2 . Certain products, such as biopolymers (i.e. polymeric susbtances of natural origin), are still limited by the production cost and capacity when considered for bulk markets. There are, however, high added value markets, for particular applications where cyanobacteria/microalgae biopolymers can be successfully commercialized due to their specific physicochemical and/or bioactive properties 3 , 4 , 5 . The relevance of these biopolymers in the bio-economy can be hailed through technological improvements and the discovery of new photoautotrophic factories 1 . Thus, bioprospecting for industrially relevant conditions (e.g. light, temperature) is key for bioprocess development and cost reduction 6 , 7 . Cyanobacteria are a promising source of biopolymers in the form of polysaccharides, which are found intracellularly (e.g. glycogen) or extracellularly as exopolysaccharides (EPS) 8 , 9 , 10 . EPS are polysaccharide-rich exudates that stick to the cell wall's outer side. However, they also exist in the supernatant, not connected to the cell wall. Although the origin of these polysaccharides in the supernatant is not fully understood, evidence suggests that they have similar monosaccharides composition 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . However, these two phases are extracted differently and are distinguished as cell-bound polysaccharides (CPS) and released polysaccharides (RPS) 15 . These biopolymers have been intensively studied, and some showed interesting techno-functional properties 16 , 17 , 18 ; with bioactive properties such as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties 19 , 20 , 21 making them good candidates for high added-value products. A comprehensive review on the methodologies applied to bioprospecting cyanobacterial EPS showed common features: light and temperature profiles are set constant, and strains explored are predominantly from Nostocales and Oscilatoriales orders and Nostoc genus 15 . These studies showed that EPS content is a strain-specific trait. The biological diversity present in culture collections can be a source of raw material for the exploration of biotechnological applications 22 . The Blue Biotechnology and Ecotoxicology Culture Collection (LEGE-CC) is a biobank of cyanobacteria and microalgae. Currently comprises more than 700 non-axenic cyanobacterial strains, 80% isolated from Portuguese environments 23 . Bioprospecting under process-oriented conditions is a useful way to determine critical process factors and use them to discover adapted microbial resources, at the same time, get closer to industrial scenarios 6 , 24 . Portugal has pioneered microalgae production and commercialization in Europe, having the oldest production unit, and now this segment is well represented by several industrial and artisanal producers 25 . The Portuguese climate has compatible conditions with the ones necessary for the industrial production of cyanobacteria. In this context, non-axenic cyanobacterial strains have been screened for relevant industrial conditions to determine and characterize their potential as a source of EPS biopolymers and non-toxic biomass for biotechnological applications. For that, strains were initially evaluated regarding their productivity and protein content when grown in photobioreactors (PBR) simulating the central Portugal spring diel light and temperatures. Then, the biomass of most productive strains under these criteria were profiled for their proximate composition (protein, carbohydrates, lipids and ashes). Strains producing RPS were prioritized. Those were checked for the presence of cyanotoxins through the detection of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these known toxins through traditional molecular methods and confirmed through ESI–LC–MS/MS. Their polysaccharides were partially characterized through GC/MS-EI of trimethylsilyl- O-glycosides for monosaccharides composition and HPSEC-MALS for molecular weight estimation. Results LEGE-CC holds EPS producing strains A pre-screening of sixty-three cyanobacterial strains (data not shown) allowed the selection of twenty-five strains through the staining of neutral polysaccharides using Alcian blue formulation. A qualitative characterization of these twenty-five strains is presented in Supplementary Material (SM) Table S1 . Overall, neutral polysaccharides were mostly attached to the cellular structure, as CPS, while some had no closeness to the cyanobacterial cells, belonging to the RPS fraction. The identification of the selected strains (SM Table S2 ) shows high diversity among them, comprising five orders: Chroococcales (54%), Synechococcales (25%), Nostocales (13%), Chroococcidiopsidales (4%) and Oscillatoriales (4%). The study sample, shown in Fig. 1 , comprises cyanobacteria from diverse habitats: freshwater environment (81%), marine origin (15%) and terrestrial (4%). Figure 1 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 183 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of cyanobacteria. Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 and G. violaceus PCC 8105 were used as the outgroup. LEGE-CC strains used in this work are indicated in bold and with a black circle. The different colour segments represent strain placement at the order level following 26 . Bootstrap values over 50% are indicated at the nodes. Full size image Strain productivity under simulated Portuguese climate The selected strains of cyanobacteria were exposed to spring-simulated conditions, with a temperature range of 11–22 °C, a maximum light intensity of ~ 1200 µmol m −2 s −1 , and a day length averaged to 14 h. Twenty-one of the twenty-five strains were able to thrive on these culture conditions while four were excluded for not being capable of duplicating their biomass during the fifteenth-day cultivation, namely Chrocodiopsales cyanobacterium LEGE 14612, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 16638, Microcystis aeruginosa LEGE 91353, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17617. In addition, other five strains were excluded from the screening due to contamination by microflagelates around day eight of cultivation: Cyanobium gracile LEGE 09399, Geminocystis sp. LEGE 16574, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 18573, Pegethrix sp. LEGE 18685 and Synechocystis sp. LEGE 16643. In sum, nine of the twenty-five strains were excluded from the following steps. The combination of diel light and temperature directly affected the biomass productivity of cyanobacteria, as shown in Fig. 2 . Two virtual groups can be distinguished: a less productive group (< 0.10 g L −1 day −1 ) composed of nine strains and a more productive group (≥ 0.1 g L −1 day −1 ) consisting of seven strains. Interestingly, the most productive group is composed of all marine strains understudy, mostly belonging to Synechocystis and Cyanobium genera ( Synechocystis salina LEGE 000038, Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041, Synechocystis salina LEGE 06099, Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140) and three freshwater strains ( Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367, Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970). Among these, the highest biomass productivity was reached by the two Cyanobium strains (Fig. 2 ). Figure 2 Biomass productivity of cyanobacterial strains for the period of 15 days. Biomass productivity is expressed in g L −1 day −1 ± standard error (n = 3). Full size image The least productive group is represented by nine strains from Chroococcales (4), Synechococcales (2), Nostocales (3) and Oscilatoriales (1) orders, namely Synechocystis sp. LEGE 06079, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE 11397, Desmonostoc muscorum LEGE 12446, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17607, Altericista sp. LEGE 17690, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19969, Planktothrix sp. LEGE XX280, Nostocales cyanobacterium LEGE 18510 and Chalicogloea sp. LEGE 18580. Protein content Figure 3 shows the protein content of cyanobacterial biomass produced in the PBR, except for Chalicogloea sp. LEGE 18580, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE 11397 and Desmonostoc muscorum LEGE 12446, due to insufficient amount of biomass. Overall, the protein content of the cyanobacterial biomass varied from 20 to 40% dry weight (DW), and there were significant differences globally (Kruskal–Wallis test, chi-squared = 36.26; df = 12, p -value < 0.001). The post-hoc Nemenyi test found significant differences between the strain LEGE 19969 (the one with higher content, 43% DW) and both LEGE 06140 and LEGE 17690 strains (the two with lower content, 24% and 24.7%, respectively). Figure 3 Protein content in percentage of dry weight (DW) of the cyanobacterial strains. Different letters indicate significant differences between strains according to the Nemenyi post-hoc test. Values are given as means ± standard deviation ( n = 3 ). Full size image The correlation between biomass productivity and protein determined by the Spearman coefficient was negative but non-significant ( \(\rho\) = − 0.29; S = 12,790; p -value = 0.07). Biomass proximate composition of most productive strains The most productive cyanobacterial strains (four marine and three freshwater) were selected, and a full biomass proximate composition was carried out (Fig. 4 ). A Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was applied in other to detect dissimilarity between strains (Fig. 5 ), presenting a stress value of 9.22 × 10 –5 . Figure 4 Biomass proximate composition of the most productive cyanobacterial strains ( n = 3 ). Full size image Figure 5 Plot of the non-metric multidimensional scaling for the biochemical composition of the seven strains. Full size image Protein content among these marine and freshwater strains varied from the highest proportions for Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 (41% DW) and the marine Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 (41%), whereas lowest content was observed for marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 (24% DW). Relative lipid content was lowest for marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 (8% DW) and highest for freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 (12% DW) (Fig. 4 ). Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038, LEGE 00041 and LEGE 06099) showed a similar total lipid content (11–12% DW), whereas Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed only 10% DW of total lipids. Ash content for marine strains varied from 10.5% DW ( Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140) to 24.3% DW ( Synechocystis salina LEGE 00038), while among freshwater strains, ash content varied from 5% ( Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611) to 6.9% DW (Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970). Carbohydrate content was highest for marine Cyanobium sp. (LEGE 06140), representing almost 60% DW, while the lowest value was found for Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 (28.1% DW). Interestingly, freshwater strains averaged higher carbohydrates than marine ones. Additionally, the marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 and freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 showed very similar levels of carbohydrate accumulation: 57% DW and 54% DW, respectively. The three Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038, 00041 and 06099) showed varying carbohydrate levels (28–39% DW). Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 registered almost even proportions of carbohydrates and protein. The NMDS analysis (Fig. 5 ) showed the biomass composition of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 and Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 were very similar, with an overlap in their positions (Fig. 5 ). These two strains are associated with high relative protein and lipid content (Fig. 4 ). Also, Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 was associated with these two components, but its higher ash content showed a displacement towards this component in the first dimension (Fig. 5 ). Synechocystis salina strain LEGE 00038 was characterized by its relatively high ash content (Fig. 4 ) and appeared associated to it (Fig. 5 ), Synechocystis salina LEGE 06099 showed the most balanced proportion of all the elements, being the closest to the origin (Fig. 5 ). Cyanobium strains LEGE 15611 and LEGE 06140 were associated with carbohydrates, since they had the largest proportion (Fig. 4 ). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was built to explore the relationships between the biochemical composition of the most productive strains (Fig. 6 ). Results of the PC1 explain 65.5% of the total variance. This component was negatively correlated with carbohydrate content and positively with protein, lipid and ash content. The PC2 axis explains 22.3% of the total variance, mostly positively correlated with lipid and protein, and negative with ash. The most remarkable pattern was the negative association between carbohydrate content and all the other components. The PC1 showed the characterization of strains LEGE Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 and Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 showed a higher relative carbohydrate content with respect to all other strains; the first was relatively richer in lipids and proteins whereas the second was poorer in lipids and proteins and richer in ash. Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 was more correlated to lipids and proteins. The PC2 confirmed two groups with opposed patterns regarding lipid and protein on one side and ash on the other. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 were richer in proteins and lipids, and Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038 and 06099) were richer in ash. Figure 6 PCA of biochemical components for the most productive cyanobacterial strains. Full size image Partial characterization of RPS Neutral polysaccharides at the end of cultivation were stained and microphotographed as shown in Fig. 7 . The marine cluster of microphotographs showed a similarity between the EPS staining composed of Synechocystis salina strains. Contrarly, the freshwater Cyanobium strains showed a difference between the connection of cells and EPS fractions. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 showed a layer of mucilage surrounding its cells while the one of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed what we could distinguish between RPS and CPS. EPS production in the form of RPS was only detected for two freshwater strains, Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. The volumetric and massic raw RPS yield was higher for the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, as shown in Table 1 . Figure 7 Microphotographs of cyanobacterial EPS after PBR cultivation stained with Alcian Blue formulation clustered by origin. Magnification ranged from 100 to 400× and was adapted to cell size to capture the main profile of EPS around the cells.

Full size image Table 1 Characterization of the volumetric and mass yields of raw RPS obtained from the two freshwater strains. Full size table Monosaccharides composition The compositions in monosaccharides of cyanobacterial RPS from Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 were carried out using GC/MS-EI (SM Figure S2 ). The molar % of monosaccharides detected in the cyanobacterial RPS are shown in Table 2 . Both RPS samples are glucose-rich, indicating the nature of these polysaccharides to be glucan-based, with other neutral sugars. The RPS of Synechocystis sp. is composed of four main monosaccharides Glucose (Glc), Galactose (Gal), Rhamnose (Rha) and Mannose (Man), while traces (molar % < 1%) of Xylose (Xyl), Fucose (Fuc) and Ribose (Rib) were detected. The RPS of the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 presents in the same way four main monosaccharides Glc, Rha, Gal and Man with traces of Xyl and Fuc. Table 2 Monosaccharides composition of cyanobacterial RPS. Full size table Molecular weight (Mw) distribution The Mw distribution of the RPSs was determined by HPLC-SEC/MALS analysis, experiments were carried out in 0.1 mol L −1 NaNO 3 (SM Figure S3 ). The polysaccharides were eluted between 16 and 23 mL which are typical range for high molecular weight fractions and exhibited distinct elution profiles. Effectively, the LS signal of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 does not return to the initial level at the end of the elution, which indicates a tailing phenomenon of the compound analyzed, unlike the RPS of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. Thus, this indicates non-ideal elution, characterized by slow elution of molecules regardless of their hydrodynamic volume which can affect the separation of entire molecular weight in the samples. In order to improve the dissolution of RPS, different parameters were tested (concentration, temperature, high homogenization). The concentration detector (refractive index detector) and the dn dc −1 used (0.150) allowed to calculate the samples recoveries compared to the original mass of the injected sample. Sample recoveries obtained from Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 was lower (< 10%) than Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 (around 30%). Filtration of the sample through a small pore size filter (≤ 0.45 μm) may result in sample loss in the case that high molecular weight RPS may be present as aggregates. These low recoveries might also be due to material loss caused by sample adsorption due to interaction with the column packing material, as suggested by the LS signal. A summary of the Mw distribution of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19,970 RPS is shown in Table 3 . Both RPS presented a polydispersity index of the same magnitude. The average Mw of the RPS of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 is higher than Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 RPS. A subtle UV signal was detected in the RPS fractions of both cyanobacteria (data not shown). Table 3 Average Mw, polydispersity index (D) and Mw distribution of cyanobacterial EPS. Full size table Cyanotoxin detection Cyanobacterial toxins were evaluated for both RPS-producing strains (Table 4 ). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection was carried out for six genes associated with the biosynthesis of four cyanotoxins (Microcystin, Saxitoxin, Cylindrospermopsin and Anatoxin). Although no genes were detected for both freshwater strains, the stx gene was initially detected for Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367. Sequencing of the amplified PCR product did not correspond to the saxitoxin-related gene. To conclude the absence of this toxin, an ESI–LC–MS/MS analysis was carried out for both biomass and supernatant of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 culture. STX standard solution showed a retention time (RT) of 3.25 min and mass fragments of 282, 266, 240, 221, 204 and 144 m/z (Figure S4 ). The Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 cell extracts and media total ion chromatograms were analyzed in the LC signal region with RT 2–10 min and all the collison induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrum did not show the fragment pattern expected for STX or Neosaxitoxin (Figure S4 C–F). Together, the evidence supports the absence of STX and Neosaxitoxin in the cells and media of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367. Therefore, both freshwater strains are free of known cyanotoxins.

Full size table Discussion This study has explored a novel way in bioprospecting EPS producing strains by subjecting them to industrially relevant conditions (diel light and temperature). A screening study comprising rich biodiversity was carried out in the Roscoff Culture Collection, with five different orders explored, broadening the knowledge of cyanobacterial RPS producers under constant light and temperature. Synechococcus sp. RCC 2380 was highlighted as a RPS-producing strain showing a fair productivity of 4 mg L day −1 27 . Our study contributed to increase the screened taxonomic diversity over five orders from several genera. When bioprospecting EPS producing strains reports have consistently focused on EPS as single product 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 while some included biomass production 34 , 35 , 36 and few biochemical parameters 37 . Using diel light and temperature to simulate real climate is crucial to address the industrial implementation of these photoautotrophic factories 38 . Understanding which strains adapts better to these conditions can help to reduce energy input for process control. For that, biomass productivity is a valuable metric to assess the potential of these strains. Spirulina sp. LEB-18 RPS-producing when grown in a 250L raceway tank showed peak biomass productivity of 0.02 g L −1 day −1 39 . Our study showed maximal biomass productivities around 0.2 g L −1 day −1 however, these are expected to lower when volume of cultivation increases. Harnessing other valuable metabolites beyond EPS can provide multi-product from one single cultivation and valorise the overall bioprocess. Some studies have explored EPS and pigments 40 , 41 or the production of bioethanol 42 . Our study has focused on the macromolecular composition of the biomass which provides a general overview of each cyanobacteria biochemical profile. Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06133 has been highlighted as a rich source of pigments (phycobiliproteins and carotenoids) with a biomass productivity of 0.14 g L −1 day −1 under optimized conditions 43 . The two most productive Cyanobium strains, showed higher biomass productivity than the one grown in optimized conditions. The other most productive strains screened in this work belong to the Synechocystis genus. Synechocystis salina has been reported as a valuable source of antioxidant molecules 44 and polyhydroxyalkanoates 45 , making them potential candidates for a biorefinery concept 46 . The demand for alternative protein sources is rising, and cyanobacteria are in the spotlight as one of them 47 . The present study evaluated the protein content of the following genus for the first time: Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17607, Altericista sp. LEGE 17690, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19969, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE XX280 and Nostocales cyanobacterium LEGE 18510. Our studied strains had relatively lower protein content in comparison to other well-studied cyanobacterial genera, namely Anabaena (43–56% DW), Arthrospira (17–72% DW), Aphanizomenon (62% DW), Synechococcus (46–63% DW) 48 . Although there are different routine methodologies for protein quantification (nitrogen analysis, colorimetric assays, and sum of anhydroamino acids), inconsistencies have been shown between the results obtained with one or the other, so conclusions about the actual protein content must be careful 48 . The model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a reported protein content varying from 32 to 57% DW 49 , similar to that found for Synechocystis strains (34–40% DW). The Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06113 was characterized by low protein content 50 , following the one here obtained for the Cyanobium strains. The most productive strains showed similar lipid content. Nordic freshwater cyanobacteria grown under synthetic wastewater showed similar total lipid content (6.7 and 23.5% DW) 51 . The freshwater Cyanobium sp. CACIAM06 showed 5.5% DW of lipid content 52 , lower than the one observed for the freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611. The different ash content obtained for marine strains compared to freshwater strains is related to the higher concentration of salts in the marine medium. Carbohydrate accumulation is thought to work as a carbon sink from photosynthesis whenever nutrient-depleted conditions occur. In addition, under non-depleted nutrient conditions, cyanobacteria can be composed of low carbohydrate content (10–30% DW) 53 . Our results showed 5 out of 7 cyanobacteria with carbohydrate content higher than 30% DW, whereas the other two have levels near this virtual maximum, indicating that the cultures might be at the end of the growth phase in nutrient-depleted conditions. In the present work, a higher average % DW of carbohydrates was found for freshwater strains in comparison with marine strains. However, there is not enough bibliography to discuss this aspect. The NMDS stress value was considerably low, indicating a very good fit. This is probably due to the relatively low number of objects in the analysis and dimensions to establish the dissimilarities. As a result, the reduction to a 2-dimensional dissimilarity plot is very simple and robust. The PCA analysis showed a negative correlation between carbohydrate and protein content. A previous study on cyanobacterial biomass have found similar results 54 . The negative correlation between carbohydrate and lipid content was described for seven cyanobacteria strains, which agrees with previously obtained results 55 , 56 . To date, no study has explored the correlation between lipid and protein content in cyanobacteria, whereas our study indicates this positive correlation for both strains of marine and freshwater environments. Our NMDS are in accordance with the PCA correlation observed. The carbohydrate levels obtained in this study correspond to intracellular carbohydrates and CPS since biomass harvest did not undergo any washing step. Thus, we can assume that Cyanobium sp. strains (LEGE 06140 and LEGE 15611) are either rich in intracellular carbohydrates or CPS. Depending on their location, these carbohydrates could be feedstock for bioenergy purposes 57 or, in the case of CPS, the production of extracts for cosmetics or cosmeceuticals 58 . The EPS detection method employed in this work has been frequently applied to detect cyanobacterial EPS 59 , 60 , 61 . As observed in the microphotographs there is not a clear distinction between the RPS-producing strains and the non producing strains, since this stain is not molecular weight specific lower sizer fractions can be also stained however, the methodology applied in this work targets high molecular weight. Therefore, the staining approach among the most productive strains served as an indicator of the EPS architecture involving the cyanobacterial cells. Cyanobacteria rich metabolism allows the use of different nutrient sources which affect their physiology and performance 56 . The use of extract sea mud in a f/2 modified media promoted an EPS productivity of 1.3 g L −1 day −1 on Cyanothece genus strain however, no insights into biomass productivity or composition was mentioned 30 . Despite the surprising EPS productivity the impact on the use of this resource at large scale must be considered. Some of the most studied cyanobacteria for EPS production were grown under diazotrophic conditions 28 , 31 , 33 , 36 . Diazotrophic conditions promoted higher RPS productivities than the ones obtained in this study namely for axenic cultures of Nostoc sp. PCC 7413 and Nostoc sp. PCC 8109 around 47 mg L −1 day −1 and 30 mg L −1 day −1 , respectively 28 . The absence of nitrogen source can have a huge economical impact on nutrients associated costs however, the sensitivity of nitrogenase enzyme to oxygen is a factor affecting the growth rate of cyanobacterial biomass and must be addressed at a strain specific level before considering industrial exploitation 62 . Our study screened non nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria from a broad range of cyanobacterial orders using an industrial optimized version of f/2 media. This formulation is expected to be cost competitive in comparison to more complete versions of cyanobacterial growth media. The RPS productivities under Portuguese climate were considerably higher when compared to those obtained from representants of Nostocales, Chroococcales, Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales, Spirulinares Pleurocapsales orders which were mostly grown under stable light and temperature conditions 27 , 29 , 32 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 63 . Both obtained RPS are glucan-based, in accordance with EPS composition described for cyanobacteria 64 . However, no uronic acid was detected, which represents a less common trait found in these EPS 9 , 65 . Two common uronic acids (GlcA and GalA) were used as standards with a detection limit of 0.5 µg µL −1 , which should be enough to detect their presence. Less common uronic acids could be expected from cyanobacteria, so further experiments are required to confirm the absence of these sugar acids. Performing a reducing step prior to derivatization with TMS, NMR 13C, or ionic chromatography without derivatization are some of the techniques to be applied. Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed four main monosaccharides, among which 80% were glucose and rhamnose, suggesting the presence of a Rhamnoglucan RPS. These two monosaccharides have been described to be ubiquitous in cyanobacterial EPS 64 . Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 monosaccharides composition has shown a distinct composition when compared to Synechocystis PCC 6803 and PCC 6714 despite glucose was a major monosaccharide, a total of 11–12 monosaccharides and uronic acid were identified 66 . PCC 6714 RPS had a glucose content more similar to Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS. Additionally, the wild type of PCC 6803 was shown to have more balanced amounts of hexoses, while derived mutants have shown increasing amounts in hexoses, particularly of glucose which seems to be closer to the RPS composition of LEGE 07367 67 , 68 . Genetic differences between these strains or the culture conditions applied could be responsible for the observed variability in monosaccharides composition. Average molecular weight found for both RPS are within the ranges described for cyanobacterial EPS 69 . Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS average molecular weight is in agreement with the molecular weight proposed for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 70 . A smaller RPS fraction was found for the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 averaging 636 kDa. The absence of a purification step for Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS could influence the polydispersity index. The conductivity and salinity parameters of the RPS were suitable for monosaccharides analysis and thus, a broader estimated range of molecular weight was obtained. Mota and collaborators 18 have observed that the RPS from Cyanothece CYY010 has a diverse relative abundance whereas most polymeric fractions ranged from 50 kDa to 343.2 Da, yet 30% of the RPS fraction contained MDa size polymers. The diversity on monosaccharides and number of molecular weight fractions clearly indicate the complexity of the RPS. In addition, these structural features found can be affected by the extraction methodologies and the analytical methods applied 9 , 71 . Purification steps can help to hinder the structures of these polysaccharides and better understand how related to each other they are. The proteic moieties detected in both RPS fractions is commonly described in cyanobacterial RPS 9 , 72 . Cyanotoxins are responsible for negatively impacting the ecosystems, however, they could also be a high added value product for standards market or biomedical applications 73 . Some Synechocystis strains were found to be potent neurotoxin and hepatotoxin producers 74 . However, in strain Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 the absence of cyanotoxins was confirmed, as well as in strain Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. This positions their interest for certain biotechnological applications. Certainly, process-oriented screenings of unexplored cyanobacterial strains will play a role in the implementation of cyanobacteria-based bioprocess for the biotechnology sector in Portugal. Conclusions The screening of cyanobacteria using diel light and temperature of Portuguese climate allowed to distinguish strains from a rich taxonomic group according to their performance, biomass composition, ability to excrete polysaccharides and produce cyanotoxins. Two cyanotoxin-free cyanobacterial strains, Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, were identified as fast growing (0.14 and 0.12 g L −1 day −1 , respectively) sourcing soluble glucan-rich RPS of high molecular weight 2910 kDa and 636 kDa, respectively. Their biomass composition rich carbohydrates (> 42% DW) and in protein (> 36% DW) hold potential for a wide range of applications. Fast-growing yet non-RPS-producing strains [ Synechocystis salina (3) and Cyanobium strains (2)] should be considered for the biorefinery concept due to their rich carbohydrate and/or protein content, which together accounted for 65–83% DW. This work provides an entry point for future outdoor cultivation of cyanobacteria with natural sunlight and reduced temperature control. The LEGE-CC showed its potential as a source of unexplored diversity, after the detection of potentially new genera of cyanobacteria, including one RPS producer. Materials and methods Strains pre-selection and cultures maintenance Sixty-three cyanobacterial strains were provided by LEGE-CC. At this point strains were kept under culture collection conditions and evaluated through light microscopy with Alcian Blue staining for neutral polysaccharides 34 . Briefly, strains (stationary phase) were kept under a 12/12 h Light/Dark cycle (L/D), light intensity < 20 µmol m −2 s −1 (fluorescent light, Acardia),19 °C, and maintained in a strain-dependent culture media: Z8 medium 75 , Z8 medium supplemented with 25‰ synthetic sea salts (salt Tropical Marin, Berlin, Germany) and 1‰ with vitamin B12 75 or BG11 0 76 Cultures and Alcian blue formulations were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and using a Leica DMLB light microscope coupled to a Leica ICC50 HD digital camera (Leica Microsystems, Germany), the presence of neutral polysaccharides was observed. Then, the twenty-five strains were adapted to Allmicroalgae’s industrial medium, based on Guillard’s F/2 medium 77 , containing 10 mM of nitrogen and 12.5 mM of iron. Cultures were kept at 25 °C, 18/6 h L/D cycle, 10–30 µmol m −2 s −1 . Marine strains were grown under the same medium but supplemented with magnesium water and NaCl to reach salinity of 30 g L −1 . DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and sequencing Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions for Gram-negative bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence (specific primer pairs available in SM Table 3 ) was obtained upon PCR amplification following the same conditions 78 . The sequencing was performed at GATC Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), and the nucleotide sequences obtained were manually inspected for quality and assembled using the Geneious Prime 2021.2.2 software (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Sequences were checked for possible chimera formation using the DECIPHER software 79 before any phylogenetic analysis. Sequences obtained were inserted in the BLASTn (Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool for Nucleotides) database, and the results were analyzed. The sequences associated with this study were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers OR046505 to OR046517. Phylogenetic analysis A total of 183 sequences were used in the final analysis, including 2 strains of Gloeobacter violaceus as outgroup, 159 sequences of cyanobacteria including type and reference strains retrieved from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA), and 22 sequences of LEGE-CC strains 23 . Multiple sequence alignment was constructed using MAFFT v7.450 80 , 81 and sequences were manually proofread and edited. The best substitution model for ML-based analyses was chosen using jModelTest 2 software 82 using the Akaike information criterion. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was carried out using the substitution model GTR + G + I with 1000 bootstrap resampling replicates using the IQ-TREE 2 software 83 . The final phylogenetic tree was edited on iTOL (Interactive Tree of Life) 84 and Inkscape 1.2 85 . Experimental set-up and photobioreactor operation Prior to cultivation in PBR, strains were placed in an orbital shaker SHK-2013 (100 rpm) for 7 days ALGAETRON AG230 (PSI Instruments) illuminated with cool white LED at 70 µmol m −2 s −1 and 22 °C under 18:6 L/D cycle. PBR cultivation was carried out in ALGEM systems (Algenuity, UK) with 25 (v/v %) inoculum, comprising 0.2 L cultivation volume. ALGEM features a geographic environment modelling that can be used to precisely simulate a specific environment. The location of Allmicroalgae S.A. production plant (39.652936 N, − 8.988986 W), was used as virtual site of experimentation, while diel light and temperature for the month of May simulated spring. The pH was set to 8 and controlled on demand through the injection of a 30% CO 2 –air mixture. Agitation was set constant at 100 rpm, and no aeration was provided. Cultivation was carried out for 15 days, and samples were taken every 2 or 3 days for culture monitoring. Biomass harvest and supernatant processing Biomass harvest was carried by centrifugation (Herareus Megafuge 16R, Germany) at 15000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored for further analysis. The supernatant was then subjected to a second centrifugation step at 18,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, to remove persistent biomass and remaining cell debris. Thereafter, the supernatant was precipitated in cold ethanol at 3:1 (v/v %) and kept overnight under − 20 °C. A mesh and a strainer were used to recover the precipitate, which was then dried and stored. Cyanobacterial growth performance Biomass productivity was calculated from biomass concentration obtained on days two and fifteen. Briefly, the biomass concentration was determined by dry cell measurements carried under mild vacuum filtration. Ammonium bicarbonate (0.5 M) was used to wash the GF/F glass microfibre filters (Whatman). Filters (F) were previously dehydrated at 60 °C for at least 24 h proceeded by silica chambers for 1 h, before (F1) and after (F2) biomass retention. Dry cell weight corresponding to biomass concentration was obtained in g L −1 and calculated according to Eq. 1 . Biomass productivity was calculated according to Eq. 2 . $$Biomass\;concentration\;C_{x} \left( {\frac{{\text{g}}}{{\text{L}}}} \right) = \frac{F2 - F1}{{Volume\;of\;culture}}$$ (1) $$Biomass\;productivity\;R_{x} \left( {\frac{g}{L \cdot day}} \right) = \frac{{\Delta C_{x} }}{days\;of\;cultivation}.$$ (2) Biomass proximate composition Protein content was estimated for the fifteen strains that grew under the simulated environment by CHN elemental analysis, according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer, using a Vario el III (Vario EL, Elemental Analyzer system, GmbH, Hanau, Germany). The final protein content was determined by multiplying the percentage of nitrogen by 5.22 86 . Lipid, ash and carbohydrate contents were only estimated for the most productive strains. The lipid content was estimated using the Bligh & Dyer method 87 described in with minor modifications 88 . Briefly, freeze dried cyanobacterial samples (7–35 mg) were mixed with ~ 0.6 g of glass beads and extracted with methanol through bead-milling using a Retsch MM 400 mixer mill at 30 Hz for 3 min. The tubes were centrifuged (10,000 g), and the supernatants were collected to new vials. The pellets suffered a second extraction, and both methanol supernatants were pooled. Chloroform and water were added to the methanol (2:1:2), and the samples were vortexed for 5 min. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (2500 g for 10 min) to obtain a biphasic system, and the lipid extract (chloroform) was separated. A known volume of the extracts was transferred to pre-weighed tubes, evaporated and weighted in order to determine the lipids gravimetrically. The ash content was determined by burning the freeze-dried biomass (approximately 35 mg) in a furnace (J. P. Selecta, Sel horn R9-L, Barcelona, Spain) at 550 °C for 6 h 89 . The carbohydrate content was determined by difference of the remaining macronutrients. RPS purification Raw RPS samples were purified when necessary, using ultrafiltration membranes (cut-off 50 kDa) by using AMICON Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit. Briefly, raw RPS samples were solubilized in ultra-pure water and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm and room temperature. Conductivity and salinity were followed (HANNA Instruments) to track the presence of salts. When a 0.2% (w/v) RPS solution exhibited low conductivity (< 500 µS cm −2 ), it was considered appropriate for further analysis. RPS partial characterization Monosaccharides composition Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) by Eletrocnic Impact (EI) was used to determine the monosaccharides composition. Briefly, 1 mL of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used for the dissolution of 10 mg of RPS. The hydrolysis step was performed with a thermoblock at 120 °C for 90 min followed by solvent evaporation under Nitrogen atmosphere at 60 °C. Trimethylsilylation derivatization method was performed as proposed by.Pierre and collaborators 90 , 91 . L-Rhamnose (L-Rha), L-Fucose (L-Fuc), L-Arabinose (L-Ara), D-Xylose (D-Xyl), D-Mannose (L-Man), D-Galactose (D-Gal), D-Glucose (D-Glc), D-Glucuronic acid (D-GlcA), D-Galacturonic acid (D-GalA), D-Glucosamine (D-GlcN), and D-Galactosamine (D-GalN) were used as standards. The samples were injected on a Shimadzu Nexus Gas Chromatrography 2030 system coupled to a GCMS-QP2020NX (Shimadzu, Japan), equipped with an OPTIMA-1MS Accent column (Macherey–Nagel, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm. Hydrogen flow rate was set at 1.75 mL min −1 . (7.8 psi). The first temperature ramp was set to 100 °C during 2.75 min then an increase until 200 °C was achieved at 8.4 °C min −1 . The second temperature ramp was raised until 215 °C during 0.95 min at a constant pace. The electronic ionization (EI, 70 eV) was carried at 150 °C, and the target ion was fixed at 40–800 m/z. The solvent cut time was set at 5 min, the split ratio was 50:1, and the temperature of the injector was 250 °C. The relative molar proportions were determined according to the area normalization. MestReNova Software 7.1.0–9185 (Mes-trelab Research, Coruña, Spain) was used to analyze the data. Mw estimation High pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled with three detectors: Multi-angle laser light scattering detector (MALS, Mini-DAWN TREOS II, Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA), differential refractive index (DRI) detector (RID-10 A, Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) and UV–vis detector (SPD-20A, Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) were used to determine molecular weight of the samples. The HPSEC line consisted of an SB-G guard column and three columns in series (SB-806 HQ, SB-804 HQ and SB-803 HQ). The system was eluted with NaNO 3 0.1 M and NaN 3 2.5 mM, filtered through a 0.02 µm, 47 mm membrane filter (Anotop 47, Whatman, Maidstone, England), and carefully degassed. RPS samples were previously prepared by stirring in the elution buffer for at least 24 h at 60 °C and homogenized in Ultraturrax at 19,000 rpm for 20 s. Lastly, samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Grace Altech, Maryland, USA). Injection was carried through a 100 µL full loop and the elution was performed with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min −1 . Data were evaluated using ASTRA 7.2.2 software. Cyanotoxin detection Molecular methods The cyanotoxin detection was carried by molecular methods. Genomic DNA was obtained as in “ DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and sequencing ” section. Genes mcyE, mcyA, were targeted for microcystin (MCs) and nodularin (NOD) production potential, sxtA, sxtG and sxtI for saxitoxin (STX), and cyrJ cylindrospermosin (CYN) and anaC-gen for anatoxin (ANA) using specific primer pairs available in SM Table 3 . Extraction, SPE and ESI-LC–MS/MS analysis Both cells and media were analyzed by ESI–LC–MS/MS to chemically confirm the Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07,367 toxicity of the Saxitoxin positive molecular outcome. Cells (fresh pellets) were collected after centrifugation, separated from the media (lyophilized) and extracted with some modifications 92 . The cells were dissolved in 15 mL of a methanolic solution (MeOH:H 2 O, v/v 20:80), sonicated to lysis (ice, 95% amplitude, 5 min) and centrifuged (5000 g, 4 °C, 2 min). This extraction was repeated twice, and all the supernatants were pooled together prior complete rotavapor dryness of the methanol. Both cell extracts and lyophilized media were resuspended in 200 mL of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade) before being submitted to solid phase extraction using Supelclean ENVI-carb cartridges (250 mg, 6 mL, SUPELCO, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). ENVI-carb cartridge was wetted with 6 mL of dichloromethane (DCM), 6 mL of MeOH, and 6 mL of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade). Samples (200 mL) were loaded at ~ 10 mL min −1 via a 12-port vacuum manifold (Waters, USA). Cartridges were then blown dry under nitrogen, eluted with 10 mL 60:40 MeOH:DCM (0.5% formic acid) into 15 mL glass test tubes and dried under vacuum with a rotary evaporator. Final extract was then reconstituted with 500 µL 10:90 H 2 O:MeOH (0.1% formic acid) and transferred to a 1.5 mL vial for LC–MS/MS analysis. Samples were injected in a Liquid Chromatograph Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC System (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA), coupled with a Mass Spectrometry LCQ Fleet™ Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). The program used for data acquisition and processing is XcaliburTM version 2. Mass Spectrometer Tune Method parameters optimization was performed thought direct injection of a Saxitoxin standard (CRM-00-STX, Lot 18-001, 99% purity, from Cifga, ES) solution of 1 ppm in10:90 H2O:MeOH (0.1% formic acid). Mass Spectrometer operated in electrospray positive polarity mode using Full scan (30–1500 m/z) and Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) at 300 m/z and 316 m/z, corresponding to Saxitoxin and Neosaxitoxin molecules ion precursors. The spray voltage maintained at 7.0 kV; Capillary temperature at 350 °C; Capillary voltage and tube lens maintained at 22 and 50 kV, respectively. Nitrogen was used as sheath and auxiliary gas and collision energy at 35 eV. Separation was achieved on a ACE Excel C18 (50 × 2.1 mm I.D., 1.7 μm, Batch: v19-3430, AVANTOR ACE ®, VWR, PT) kept at 30 °C, with a flow rate of 0.25 mL min −1 . and injected volume was 10 μL in loop partial mode. The eluents used were methanol (A) and water (B) both acidified with formic acid at 0.1% (v/v). The gradient program started at 30% A, increasing to 60% A in 10 min, turning back to initial conditions in 5 min, equilibrating more 10 min with 30% A. Under these conditions, the SAX retention time (RT) was 3.75 min and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 3 μg L −1 and 5 μg L −1 , respectively. The precursor ion (m/z 300) and SAX reference fragment ions with m/z values of 282, 266, 240, 221, 204 and 144 were searched in the CID mode, to validate the presence or absence of the toxin. Statistical analysis All the analyses were performed with R software 93 . The Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test was performed with the kruskal.test function from the stats package, and the post-hoc Nemenyi test, with the function kwAllPairsNemenyiTest from the PMCMRplus package. Multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed with manova function from stats package, and multi-variate Shapiro–Wilks test with the function mvShapiro.Test , from package mvShapirotTest . Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated with cor function from stats package. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, employing Bray–Curtis distance, was performed with metaMDS function, from vegan package.PCA was performed with PCA function from FactoMineR package. Data availability Accession number of the genetic sequences were deposited in GENBANK and are available in supplementary material—Table S2 .

Swimming is banned for people and pets, according to the Oregon Health Authority, just as Portlanders need to cool off. By Katherine Chew Hamilton August 16, 2023 A cyanobacteria bloom Image: Cheng Wei/shutterstock.com Update 8/16/23: Cyanobacteria has quickly bloomed across the entire downtown swath of the Willamette River. According to an advisory issued on August 15 by the Oregon Health Authority, the affected span runs from the Ross Island Lagoon northward (that’s downstream) to Cathedral Park. That area includes Cottonwood Bay Park, Willamette Park, and Poet’s Beach, as well as the popular swimming areas at Duckworth Dock and Cathedral Park. The OHA emphasizes that in the affected areas, people and pets are advised to stay dry and not drink the water, because water ingestion is the primary route of exposure (not skin contact). Other activities are safe, including catch-and-release fishing, camping, hiking, biking, picnicking, bird-watching, canoeing, and kayaking. Boating is safe as long as speeds do not create excessive water spray, which can lead to inhaling cyanotoxins. OHA water sample testing will continue this week. Now is prime time for plunging into Oregon’s rivers, lakes, and swimming holes . But you (and your dog) might want to look before you leap. The Oregon Health Authority issued advisories for cyanobacteria blooms in four bodies of water in the Portland area. “Pets are who we’re most concerned about,” says David Farrer, a toxicologist for the Oregon Health Authority. “We’ve never had any people that we know of die from exposure to one of these blooms, but we have had a lot of animals die from these blooms, especially dogs, sometimes livestock.” Blooms can look like blue or blue-green paint, thick like pea soup, or foamy and reddish brown, like the photos here . As of August 2, affected areas near Portland include Aarons Lake, Pete’s Slough, and Sturgeon Lake on Sauvie Island , as well as the Willamette River near Willamette Cove . Near Vancouver, WA, advisories have also been issued for Lacamas Lake and Vancouver Lake. These warnings counsel against swimming and drinking the water, even with filtering. High-speed boating is also not recommended, due to spray that leads to inhalation. Eating fish from these waters is also ill-advised. Cyanobacteria blooms, which are often colloquially referred to as “algae” blooms aren’t really algae, according to OHA . Cyanobacteria naturally occur in bodies of fresh water worldwide, but when they bloom en masse, they sometimes produce high levels of cyanotoxins, like microcystins and cylindrospermopsin. When ingested, they can produce red rashes on the skin, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea for up to 72 hours. For dogs, ingesting cyanotoxins can even be deadly . Summer and early fall are the peak seasons for cyanobacteria blooms (they happened last August, too , and every previous year since monitoring began ). Sunlight and warm water temperatures help the bacteria thrive, as do nutrients from human activity like fertilizer and waste. Climate change and high population density also contribute to the increasing frequency of algae blooms. You’re more likely to find them in shallow, warm, and still bodies of water—which, Farrer notes, can also include backyard ponds or livestock troughs. It’s impossible to tell whether a bloom is toxic just by looking at it, and not all bodies of water are regularly tested for cyanotoxins. Thus, experts say to avoid bodies of water with visible cyanobacteria blooms. You can check out a complete list of Oregon advisories here , and Washington advisories here .

Initially, the bioreactor containing 3N-BBM medium was inoculated with Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus mixture with a density of 1.0 × 10 4 cells/mL and the consortium was cultivated for 30 days. Then, the bioreactor was semi-continuously fed with liquid digestate with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 days, and the treatment process was continued for the next 15 weeks. The change in the microalgal and cyanobacterial species domination was measured in regular intervals using cell counting with droplet method on a microscope slide. At the end of the experiment, Desmonostoc sp. cyanobacteria (identified with 16S ribosomal RNA genetical analysis) as well as Tetradesmus obliquus green algae along with Rhodanobacteraceae and Planococcaceae bacteria (determined with V3–V4 16sRNA metagenomic studies) dominated the microbial community in the photobioreactor. The experiment demonstrated high treatment efficiency, since nitrogen and soluble COD were removed by 89.3 ± 0.5% and 91.2 ± 1.6%, respectively, whereas for phosphates, 72.8 ± 2.1% removal rate was achieved.

Special attention is paid to the management of waste generated in various production processes 1 , 2 , 3 . Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a leading technology used for organic waste valorization and generation of energy. The anaerobic treatment process has many benefits, mainly production of methane-rich biogas resulting in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 4 . At the same time, each biogas plant generates troublesome byproducts, mainly digestate. Raw digestate contains large amounts of organic solids, is rich in nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) but can also contain heavy metals and other toxic substances. The composition of digestate depends on many different factors, including feedstock composition, digester operating conditions or the source of microbial inoculum. Digestate can be processed in its original form or can be separated into liquid fraction (containing the majority of the volatile solids) and solid fraction (containing mostly insoluble particles). Solid digestate is often composted or processed into fertilizer, while liquid digestate is much more difficult to manage. Importantly, treated liquid digestate, can be re-used in biogas plants to dilute raw waste, which, in turn, could significantly reduce water consumption 5 , 6 . Unfortunately, conventional treatment methods applied to liquid digestate have many shortcomings, including high operating costs, generation of unwanted by-products, or weak nutrient removal 7 . Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly techniques, to treat liquid effluents generated in biogas plants. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the use of microalgae or microalgae-bacteria consortia systems. Microalgae are a diverse group of photoautotrophic organisms capable to bind CO 2 and convert it into a valuable source of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates stored in biomass. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are able to tolerate and grow in a variety of environments, including liquid digestate. However, only a few types of microalgae (e.g., Tetradesmus sp., Chlorella sp., Desmodesmus sp.) have been reported to survive in such environment 8 , 9 , 10 . The presence of water and nutrients in the digestate allows for a cost-effective microalgae cultivation with simultaneous treatment 11 . It has been shown that microalgae–bacteria consortia are more suitable for digestate treatment than monocultures or microalgal axenic cultures. During photosynthesis, microalgae produce oxygen, further used by aerobic bacteria to mineralize organic compounds. Indigenous bacteria, on the other hand, provide microalgae with carbon dioxide, necessary for their growth. In addition, nitrifying bacteria can oxidize high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen that can be toxic to microalgae and thus improve the removal of nitrogen from the digestate. Through a symbiotic relationship, it is possible to obtain greater removal rates of pollutants and acquire highly valuable biomass 12 , 13 , 14 . To fully incorporate circular economy concept, a lipid-rich microalgal biomass cultivated on the liquid digestate can be further used as a sustainable feedstock for the 3rd and 4th generation biodiesel 7 . The dynamic relationship between bacteria and microalgae during the digestate treatment can be quite complex. It has been noticed that microalgae are able to compete with bacteria for nutrients, mainly in a phosphate-limiting environment 15 . Besides, it was found that the survival of pathogenic bacteria present in the digestate can be limited by various conditions of microalgae cultivation, such as high light intensity, variable pH, an increased concentration of dissolved oxygen or continuous stirring applied in the bioreactor 16 . In the research reported by Sobolewska et al. 10 , a microbial consortium containing Tetradesmus obliquus , Desmodesmus subspicatus and Microglena sp. green algae was reported to efficiently remove both nutrients and organic pollutants from the liquid digestate in a small-scale laboratory installation. The following study summarizes the results of the undiluted liquid digestate treatment performed in a larger-scale photobioreactor operated under conditions closer to industrial implementation. Particular attention was paid to the microbial community and the roles of microalgae, bacteria and cyanobacteria in the treatment process. In contrast to the experiments described by other authors 12 , 17 , 18 , 19 , in this research, pretreatment of the substrate such as dilution or sterilization was not applied. Additionally, rarely used environmental isolates, including Microglena sp. (previously applied only in limited studies 10 ) were employed allowing to achieve high removal rates of both nutrients and organic contaminants. Materials and methods Liquid digestate The digestate was delivered from Warmia Fruit and Vegetable Processing Company Ltd. (Kwidzyn, Poland) as a product generated during anaerobic digestion of corn, peas and bean wastes. The liquid fraction was then obtained by centrifuging the digestate for 10 min at 4000 rpm (4800 G) using a Rotina 420 centrifuge (Hettich, Switzerland). The substrate was not subjected to the initial pre-treatment such as sterilization or dilution as such processes are usually omitted on a technological scale 20 . During the experiment, the liquid digestate was stored at 4 °C in closed plastic containers. Before each batch cycle, the substrate was first brought to room temperature. To confirm substrate stability, a full psychochemical analysis of the liquid digestate was performed 4 times throughout the study period according to the methodology described in “ Chemical and physical analyses ”. The characteristic of the liquid digestate is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 Chemical and physical composition of liquid digestate* Full size table Inoculum Bioreactor was inoculated with Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus microalgae mixture of 1.0 × 10 4 cells/mL cell density. The respective species were isolated, genetically identified and their sequences were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for the rbcl gene under accession number of ON457158–ON457161, and ON426490–ON42693 for ITS region ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov , accessed on 20 April 2022), which was described by Sobolewska et al. 10 . For the initial microalgae multiplication, a cultivation on Bold Basal Medium with threefold nitrogen concentration (3N-BBM), prepared in accordance with Andersen 21 was used. Photobioreactor design and operation The experiment was carried out semi-continuously in a glass photobioreactor with a 5 L working volume and continuous stirring at 150 rpm (Fig. 1 ). The reactor was illuminated with LED lamps in the 14 h light/10 h dark cycle mode. T8 LED Linio model lamps with the following parameters: 1440 lm (luminous power), 14.5 W (electric power) and 6000 K (color temperature) were employed for the process. The illumination intensity was set at 3500 Lux. A membrane pump (Yasunaga, Japan) delivered air to the reactor at a flow rate of 0.2 L/L/min. Initially, the bioreactor was filled with a 3N-BBM medium, inoculated with a 10% v/v microalgae consortium, and operated in a batch mode for 30 days to increase the biomass concentration. After this period, the reactor was semi-continuously fed with the liquid fraction of the digestate for the next 15 weeks. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 30 days following the previous experiences 10 , 22 . Once a day, 167 mL of the liquid was withdrawn from the reactor and the same volume of fresh liquid digestate was introduced. As the biomass was not recycled back to the bioreactor, the hydraulic retention time was equal to solid retention time (SRT). Feeding and discharge operation was carried out by a peristaltic pump. Once a week total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity as well as biomass parameters, including optical density (OD), the concentration of chlorophyll a (chl- a ) and the microalgal cell abundance were measured in the effluent. pH, soluble COD (sCOD), ammonium nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites, orthophosphates were determined in the effluent after filtration. The efficiency of nutrient and organic contaminant removal was calculated for steady-state period with Eq. ( 1 ). Steady-state period was defined as an experimental period during which most of the determined indicators were not changing by more than 10%. The removal efficiency of individual indicators was calculated assuming theoretical, complete separation of microalgal biomass. $$ {\text{R}}\left[ \% \right] = \left( {{\text{c}}_{{1}} {-}{\text{c}}_{{2}} } \right) \times {1}00/{\text{c}}_{{1}} $$ (1) Where R—removal efficiency of an indicator (PO 4 3− ; NH 4 + , NO 3 − , NO 2 − (total nitrogen); COD); c 1 —concentration of an indicator in the fresh liquid digestate; c 2 —concentration of an indicator in the effluent. Figure 1 Installation with a photobioreactor used for the experiment. Full size image Analytical methods Chemical and physical analyses All chemical analyses were performed using an UV–VIS DR6000 spectrophotometer (Hach Lange, Loveland, CO, USA) and Hach Lange tests. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, total volatile fatty acids, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium nitrogen and orthophosphates were measured by LCK214, LCK365, NitraVer 5, NitriVer 3 tests, a modified Nessler method (no. 8038) and a PhosVer 3 test (no. 8048), respectively. The contents of nitrogen in ammonium nitrogen, nitrates and nitrites were then summed up to calculate the total nitrogen (Eq. 2 ). Measurements of organic nitrogen forms were not performed considering the fact that liquid digestate primarily consists of ammonium nitrogen and only low amounts of organic nitrogen forms 23 , 24 . The concentration of chlorides, sulfides and sulfates were measured by a thiocyanate method no. 8113, a methylene blue method no. 8131 and a SulfaVer 4 method no. 8051, respectively. In addition, an AluVer method no. 8012 (for aluminum), CuVer 1 method no. 8506 (for cooper), FerroVer method no. 8008 (for iron), Zincon method no. 8009 (for zinc) were applied. The Hach Lange kits were applied to diluted samples to match detection ranges of the tests used. Final indicator values were calculated including the dilution factor used. The color, turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) were assessed in accordance with 8025, EN ISO 7027 and 8006 methods, respectively. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS) and pH were examined in accordance with Standard Methods 25 . Biomass productivity was calculated in accordance to methodology described in Min et al. 26 based on TSS values: $$ {\text{Total nitrogen }}\left[ {{\text{mgN}}/{\text{L}}} \right] \, = \, 0.{778} \times {\text{ cNH}}_{{4}}^{ + } + \, 0.{226 } \times {\text{ cNO}}_{{3}}^{ - } + \, 0.{3}0{4 } \times {\text{ cNO}}_{{2}}^{ - } $$ (2) Where 0.778—nitrogen molar mass to NH 4 + molar mass ratio; 0.226—nitrogen molar mass to NO 3 − molar mass ratio; 0.304—nitrogen molar mass to NO 2 − molar mass ratio; c [mg/L]—concentration of a respective nitrogen form (NH 4 + /NO 3 − /NO 2 − ). Biomass analysis Optical density Optical density was measured at 680 nm, which correlated with the second peak of chlorophyll absorption, and reflected the concentration of biomass in the cell suspension 27 . This value was also confirmed experimentally by scanning microalgal culture in the absorption spectrum between 540 and 900 nm. The analysis was performed using a UV–VIS DR6000 spectrophotometer (Hach Lange, Loveland, CO, USA). Quantitative and qualitative microalgae–cyanobacteria structure in photobioreactor The density of microalgal and cyanobacterial cells in the bioreactor was established using a droplet method on a microscope slide. Only healthy, active cells were counted. The abundance of cells was calculated based on Eq. ( 3 ). Additionally, the percentage share of the individual taxa in examined biomass was ascertained. $$\mathrm{Dx }[{\text{cells}}/{\text{mL}}] = (\mathrm{zi }\times \mathrm{ Ap})/(\mathrm{Ai }\times \mathrm{ V})$$ (3) where Dx—the density of cells in 1 mL of culture, zi—cell number of particular taxa, Ap—the cover-slip surface area (= 400 mm 2 ), Ai—the surface area observed under the microscope (mm 2 ), V—the sample volume placed on a microscope slide (cm 2 ). Chlorophyll a concentration To determine the chlorophyll a concentration, the procedure according to Lee et al. 28 was used. After extraction performed with a 90% methanol solution, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at the wavelengths of 665 nm and 650 nm. For these measurements, a 10 mm path length of the cuvette was applied. The chlorophyll a concentration was calculated based on Eq. ( 4 ): $$ {\text{chl - }}a\left[ {{\text{mg}}/{\text{L}}} \right] = \left( {{16}.{5} \times {\text{A}}_{{{665}}} } \right) - \left( {{8}.{3} \times {\text{A}}_{{{65}0}} } \right) $$ (4) Taxonomic analysis of cyanobacteria Cultivation of Desmonostoc has been done to multiply its biomass in the form of unialgal culture, prior to isolation of its DNA, to obtain high DNA yields of good quality. Isolation of cells and multiplication of strain biomass for DNA isolation protocols is a standard procedure, widely used in algal molecular characterization. The cyanobacteria taxa from bioreactor were identified using an integrated morphological and molecular approach. Individual trichomes were isolated using microcapillary and inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E, Precoptic Co., Warsaw, Poland) via passaging through a series of BG-11 drops to washed out excess of bacteria and transferred into sterile 1.5% BG-11 agar plates. Biological material was cultivated under artificial light from fluorescent tubes (Osram FLUORA T8 L 36W/77) of 2800 Lux in a 16 h/8 h day/night period, with a temperature of 22  ± 0.2 °C and air humidity of 50 ± 5%. The genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy PowerBiofilm Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The 16S rRNA molecular region was amplified by PCR reaction, using primers 359F 29 and 23S30R 30 with Color Perpetual Taq PCR Master Mix (Eurx, Gdansk, Poland) in 50 μL reaction volume under the reaction conditions as in Nowicka-Krawczyk et al. 31 . The results of PCR were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel and the sample was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The sample was sequenced commercially using Sanger Sequencing and the primers of PCR reaction. The sequences were assembled and clean up in Geneious software ver.11.0.15 and screened using BLAST in nucleotide collection of NCBI GenBank database. Obtained sequence was submitted to GenBank under the OQ792152 accession number. Determination of microcystins To confirm whether Desmonostoc sp. cyanobacteria, present in the tested culture do not produce cyanotoxins and can only positively contribute to nitrogen and phosphorous removal, a HPLC-DAD analysis was conducted for the presence of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and microcystin-RR (MC-RR). To analyze the microcystin (MC) content in freshwater material, the 13 mL of sample was filtered through GF/C Whatmann filter. The material collected on the filter was extracted in a 75% solution of aqueous methanol and then the sample was sonicated for 30 s in the Misonix (Farmingdale, NY, USA) ultrasonicator with a ultrasonic liquid processor XL. The extract was then centrifuged twice at 11,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C in the Eppendorf 5804 centrifuge (Germany). The supernatant was collected and together with a water subsample after filtration process were evaporated to dryness in the SC110A Speedvac ® Plus, ThermoSavant (Holbrook, NY, USA). The samples were redissolved in 500 μL of 75% aqueous methanol and filtered through a Gelman GHP Acrodisc 13 mm syringe filter with a 0.45 μm GHP membrane and minispike outlet (East Hills, NY, USA). A chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 1100 series HPLC system consisting of a degasser, a quaternary pump, a column compartment thermostat set at 40 °C, and a diode array detector operated at 200–300 nm on a Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) Purospher STAR RP-18e column (250 mm × 4 mm I.D. with 5 μm particles) protected by a 4 mm × 4 mm guard column. The mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 1 mL/min with the following linear gradient program: 25% B at 0 min, 70% B at 5 min, 70% B at 6 min, 25% B at 6.10 min; stop time, 9 min. The injection volume was 20 μL. The content of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and microcystin-RR (MC-RR) in the samples was analyzed by comparing the retention time and UV spectrum (200–300 nm with an absorption maximum at 238 nm). For calibration of the HPLC analysis, commercial standards of MCs (EnzoLife Sci.) were used. Metagenomic analysis At the end of the experimental run, the biomass from the reactor was analyzed metagenomically (V3-V4 of 16S rRNA) for bacterial community. The collected biomass was stored at − 20 °C until analysis. For the isolation of genomic DNA, Genomic Mini AX Bacteria + kit (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) was applied. The FastPrep-24 homogenizer and zirconia beads were used to perform mechanical cell lysis. The PCR was carried out applying Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, United Kingdom). Dedicated primer sequences 314F (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 785R (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC) were used to amplify the selected region. Amplification, indexing as well as library quantification were executed on an Illumina MiSeq system in accordance to the procedure of ""16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation"" with Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase applied as the only modification method. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was conducted on a MiSeq apparatus, in 2 × 300 paired-ends, using the Illumina v3 kit (Illumina, USA). Bioinformatic analysis ensuring the classification of reads to the species level was performed with the QIIME 2 software package based on Silva 138 (reference sequence database). Metagenomic data stored in fastq format has been deposited to the NCBI database. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) tool was used to create a bioproject with accession number of PRJNA922144, and generated BioSampleAcc. number of SAMN32643820. The 16S rRNA gene fragments were matched to the appropriate taxonomical levels (from phylum to species) in order to determine phylogenetic microbial diversity. Statistical analysis The measurements were conducted in triplicates and results were expressed as mean value ± standard deviation. Mean values, standard deviation, error bars and the analysis of correlation were determined in Microsoft Excel 365 (version 2211). Results and discussion Characteristic of liquid digestate The composition of liquid digestate is depicted in Table 1 . The liquid was characterized by alkaline pH, typical for plant waste digestate 32 , and COD greater than that typically reported in the literature 33 . It also contained a significant concentration of nitrates (1020 mg/L) and orthophosphates (350 mg/L). The analysis for metals showed the highest concentration of zinc (15.04 mg/L) and lowest content of iron (4.07 mg/L). The digestate was also characterized by relatively low salinity with 217 mg/L of chlorides and 1.5 mg/L of sulfides. Photobioreactor performance The liquid digestate treatment process was evaluated based on the removal rates of nutrients and organic carbon (expressed in COD). Changes in pH, nitrogen, orthophosphates, total and soluble COD are shown in Fig. 2 . Characteristics of effluent collected from the bioreactor and pollutant removal rates are shown in Table 2 . Figure 2 Changes in pH ( a ), orthophosphates ( b ), nitrogen ( c ), COD ( d ), turbidity and TSS ( e ) in the photobioreactor effluent. Full size image Table 2 Characteristics of the effluent from the photobioreactor and the pollutants removal efficiency in the steady state period. Full size table Removal of phosphates Phosphorus plays a significant role in the growth and energy metabolism of microalgae. Microalgae mainly use inorganic phosphates and transform them into organic compounds by the process of phosphorylation 34 . In the 3N-BBM medium used for initial cultivation of microalgae, phosphorous was supplied with K 2 HPO 4 and KH 2 PO 4 , salts known as one of the most bioavailable sources of this nutrient for microalgae 35 . Regarding the liquid digestate used in the study, the phosphorous concentration (calculated based on orthophosphates) remained below the threshold value of 0.179 g/L reported in the literature to be inhibitory for microalgae 36 . It can be hypothesized that an increased removal rate of phosphate could be due to a generally high initial concentration of this nutrient. This phenomenon is known as “luxury phosphorous uptake”, which relies on greater phosphate accumulation by microorganisms cultivated under stressful conditions as described previously 37 , 38 . During the experimental run, the pH value in the effluent remained at approximately 8 for the first 6 weeks. After this period, a decrease in pH was observed, which corresponded with a drop in orthophosphates. This further indicates that removal of phosphates resulted from microbial uptake rather than precipitation 34 . The most noticeable phosphate decrease strongly corresponded with the significant growth of microalgae reported between the 5th and 11th week. In the same time, an intensive development of cyanobacteria (and probably bacteria) was also observed. It should be noted that these microorganisms usually exhibit higher ability to fix phosphorous than microalgae 39 , 40 . After reaching steady state (8–15 weeks), the average concentration of orthophosphates dropped to 95.1 ± 7.3 mg/L (Fig. 2 b) and the calculated removal rate for this period was 72.8 ± 2.1%. The removal rate of phosphates was therefore greater than that reported in the previous experiments described by Sobolewska et al. 10 . This could have been influenced by the appearance of cyanobacteria Desmonostoc sp., which could enhance the treatment process (further discussed in “ Biomass parameters monitoring ” and “ Relative abundance of microbial community in bioreactor ”). Higher removal rates of 78.3 ± 1.1% were reported by Sayedin et al. 41 describing the treatment of thin stillage anaerobic digestate by microalgae. However, the cited authors investigated diluted liquid digestate after preliminary struvite recovery. In another study, the liquid digestate from maize silage and distillery stillage anaerobic processing was subjected to biological treatment using two microalgal species 42 . The authors used centrifugation/distillation and dilution as pretreatments and achieved 94.2% and 70.4–87.4% phosphorous removal rates for Arthrospira platensis and Chlorella vulgaris, respectively. In contrast, Deng et al. 43 treated sterilized anaerobic digestate from swine manure reaching 20.0–29.7% of total phosphorous removal. Nitrogen removal Nitrogen is a nutrient necessary for the growth and metabolic processes of all living organisms. Eukaryotic microalgae assimilate inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium, nitrates and nitrites while cyanobacteria can also transform atmospheric nitrogen 34 , 44 . Although nitrates are a preferred nitrogen source, ammonium nitrogen is usually assimilated by microalgae faster 45 , 46 . The ability to assimilate various nitrogen forms or their inhibitory concentrations are species and strain dependent 47 . In the 3N-BBM medium, ammonium nitrogen was not present (NaNO 3 used as a primary nitrogen source), while in digestate both ammonium nitrogen and nitrates were. An increased ammonium concentration could potentially inhibit the microalgal growth, however, in the previous study reported by Sobolewska et al. 10 , the Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus consortium could successfully grow in the same substrate. The concentration of nitrates showed a slightly increasing trend throughout the entire run, whereas ammonium nitrogen increased up to 6th week, and then dropped. From the 8th week of the experimental run, both nitrogen forms remained at relative constant levels suggesting stabilization of the process (steady-state operation). After the 6th week of the experiment, a simultaneous decrease in both pH and ammonium nitrogen concentration was reported (Fig. 2 a,c) suggesting the possible occurrence of nitrification. The presence of nitrifying bacteria within the reactor community was also confirmed in the metagenomic analysis. However, as dissolved oxygen and/or CO 2 /carbonates were not measured, it cannot be unambiguously confirmed that nitrification was the main process, which contributed to nitrogen removal. Apart from nitrification, ammonium nitrogen could have been removed through its microbial assimilation by bacteria and microalgae as well as cyanobacteria. The activity of nitrifying bacteria contributes to the reduction of free ammonia concentration, which might be toxic to microalgae. Hence, the coexistence of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria could increase the removal rate of nitrogen and overall bioreactor performance as reported previously 14 , 48 . Considering the steady-state operation, nitrogen was removed in 89.3 ± 0.5%, and its average concentration in the effluent was 73.4 ± 3.8 mgN/L. Lower treatment efficiency was reported by Xu et al. 49 for piggery anaerobic liquid digestate. It should be noted that authors used initial substrate sterilization and dilution achieving total nitrogen removal rates of 58.39–74.63%. Pizzera et al. 17 investigated diluted liquid agro-digestate treated by Chlorellaceae and Scenedesmaceae reaching 20 ± 29% total nitrogen removal rates. In contrast, Khalid et al. 50 achieved 96% NH 4 + removal rates for recycled, sterilized agricultural wastewater. A similar treatment efficiency was also demonstrated by Sayedin et al. 41 . COD and TSS changes Carbon, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, is an important component used by microalgae. It can be consumed either directly in the form of soluble carbonates, or converted into carbon dioxide and then utilized through photosynthesis 34 . Although some microalgae can directly assimilate organic carbon 51 , the removal of organic substances is mainly due to bacterial activity in mixed cultures. On the other hand, microalgae can provide oxygen necessary for decomposition of organic substances by bacteria, which, in turn, release carbon dioxide used by photosynthetic organisms 44 , 52 . The observed COD reduction was therefore associated with the activity of both co-existing microbial groups. As shown in Fig. 2 d, a sharp decrease in total and soluble COD was observed after the first week of the treatment process. From the third week, the values of total and soluble COD remained at a constant low level of 1687.5 ± 482.9 mgO 2 /L and 696.9 ± 128.0 mgO 2 /L, respectively. For that period, the calculated sCOD removal rate exceeded 90% while the corresponding value for tCOD was 79%. Zhu et al. 53 noted lower efficiency for non-sterilized dairy liquid digestate (DLD) but the authors employed axenic cultures of Chlorella vulgaris. They observed that with increasing DLD load, the sCOD removal rate also increased from 1.5% (25% DLD) to 32.2% (100% DLD). The sCOD removal rate of 29 ± 17% was reached by Pizzera et al. 17 , who investigated diluted liquid digestate from agricultural waste processing. Likewise, Wang et al. 54 treated diluted dairy manure digestate using wild-type microalgae. Depending on the dilution used, the sCOD removal rates of 27.4–38.4% were achieved. Bankston and Higgins 18 showed that axenic cultures of Chlorella sorokiniana and Auxenochlorella protothecoides cultivated on diluted, sterilized digestate may increase soluble COD whereas the presence of anaerobic digestion microorganisms suppress this effect to a small extent. In contrast to COD, turbidity and especially TSS showed an increasing trend throughout the experiment (Fig. 2 e). Turbidity is directly influenced by light dispersion resulting from the presence of colloids, suspended particles, pollutants and microorganisms 55 . This may also explain the correlation between turbidity, optical density and the abundance of microalgae (which form colloidal structures) as illustrated in Fig. 3 . Although all microorganisms can influenced turbidity and TSS, it seems that cyanobacteria and microalgae were mainly responsible for this since a correlation between chlorophyll a concentration (Fig. 3 a), TSS and turbidity was noticed. Biomass productivity, calculated as a function of TSS (see “ Chemical and physical analyses ”) was recorded at 11 mg/L/day. Given the proper separation of treated effluent, the remaining biomass can be valorized to generate biofuels or other value-added products (pigments, nutraceuticals, fertilizers) 56 , 57 . Figure 3 Changes in optical density, chlorophyll a concentration ( a ) and percentage share of particular taxa of microalgae and cyanobacteria ( b ). Full size image Biomass parameters monitoring During the experimental run, the growth of microalgal biomass was monitored with optical density, chlorophyll a concentration and cell count determinations (Fig. 3 ). After initial cultivation, for the first 7 weeks Tetradesmus obliquus followed by Microglena sp. were the most abundant microalgae. Then, the number of T. obliquus cells gradually decreased, which corresponded to a pH drop below 7. The growth of T. obliquus is strongly dependent on environmental pH with the optimal value close to 7. Lower pH may result in cell division inhibition 21 , 58 . Simultaneously, from the 8th week, the growth of heterocytous bacteria was also observed. The morphological features of trichomes allowed to predict the Nostoc sensu lato group. However, molecular analysis (BLASTn) confirmed the presence of Desmonostoc species with 100% coverage and 100% identity to Desmonostoc sp. PCC7422 (HG004586). As the digestate used in this study had not been subjected to pre-treatment processes (see “ Liquid digestate ”), it contained various native microorganisms. It can therefore be assumed that singular Desmonostoc sp. cells were introduced to the bioreactor along with the digestate, and their rapid multiplication was accelerated by the temperature increase and pH drop 59 . For example, Desmonostoc muscorum was observed in soils at pH below 5.0 60 . In general, representatives of this genus prefer slightly acidic to neutral environment (pH 5.3 up to 7.0) 61 . A rapid growth of cyanobacteria was reflected by an increase in optical density, chlorophyll a concentration, as well as TSS and turbidity. A strong correlation between these indicators (R > 0.85) was found. Although it is commonly believed that cyanobacteria can produce toxins hazardous for other organisms, their release is usually strain dependent 62 . Cyanotoxins can be released during water treatment processes as a result of mechanical and chemical stress factors 63 . For instance, the use of aluminum sulfate or chlorine dioxide for water and wastewater treatment can contribute to the lysis of cyanobacteria cells and caused the release of microcystins into water as demonstrated for full-scale applications 64 , 65 . However, a HPLC–DAD analysis (described in “ Determination of microcystins ”) confirmed the absence of MC-LR and MC-RR microcystins in the analyzed samples. Moreover, the presence of blue-green algae can also facilitate bioremediation and biomass generation, which can be further processed to value added products 66 . Relative abundance of microbial community in bioreactor Metagenomic analysis of the biomass collected at the end of the experimental run allowed to assess the microbial community (bacteria and archaea) present in the photobioreactor. The community was dominated by Cyanobacteria (37.59%) and Proteobacteria (34.96%) phyla followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota. Within the Cyanobacteria phylum, 27% of relative abundance was attributed to Desmonostoc sp. and 5% to Tetradesmus obliquus green algae, which were reported to grow under harsh environmental conditions, utilizing recalcitrant substances and nutrients 59 , 67 . Degradation of organic substances, reflected by a COD decrease can be linked to the activity of bacteria, especially those attributed to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota phyla 68 . Moreover, numerous species of Proteobacteria are known to remove phosphorous and nitrogen from wastewater 69 . The removal of phosphates can also be linked to the appearance of bacteria belonging to the Chloroflexi phylum 70 . On the other hand, nitrogen transformation could have been influenced by Rhizobiales (14.63% relative abundance). Within this order, Beijerinckiaceae , Rhizobiaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the dominant families, and these microbes could be responsible for nitrogen fixation and denitrification 71 , 72 . Salinarimonas sp. (4.29% of relative abundance) is known to grow in the pH range of 6–9, utilizes nitrates as a nitrogen source and is commonly found in substrates such as soil or piggery derived digestates 73 , 74 . Other denitrifying bacteria belonged to Rhodanobacter sp. within the Xanthomonadales order (10.45% relative abundance), and were previously reported to easily adapt to nitrogen-rich environments and low pH 75 . Furthermore, the appearance of Sporosarcina sp. ( Planococcaceae ) along with Ferruginibacter sp. ( Chitinophagaceae ) could enhance both nitrogen and COD removal as these bacteria are capable of simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and organic matter degradation 76 . Other bacteria detected belonged to the Sphingomonadaceae family with Sandaracinobacter sp. being the most abundant and Comamonadaceae dominated by Comamonas sp. A photoheterotrophic bacteria Sandaracinobacter sp. has been described as capable of degrading various organic compounds and growing at pH of 6–8. Species of these bacteria were previously found in soil, freshwater or sludge 77 , 78 , 79 . Comamonas sp., has been previously reported to reduce nitrites and accumulate polyphosphates 48 , 80 (Fig. 4 ). Figure 4 Microbial community of the reactor biomass at an order and family level. Full size image The majority of detected bacteria and cyanobacteria (i.e., Desmonostoc sp., Salinarimonas sp., Rhodanobacter sp., Sporosarcina sp, Sandaracinobacter sp., Nitrosomonas sp., Nitrospira sp., Nitrosospira sp.) inhabit environments within the pH range of 6–9 and are commonly found in digestates or agricultural substrates 59 , 67 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 81 . Bacteria native for the raw substrate did not directly influence the microalgal population as chlorophyll a concentration did not change with digestate feeding (Fig. 3 a). It is believed that microalgae–bacteria consortia are more suitable for digestate treatment than axenic or non-axenic monocultures. During photosynthesis, microalgae produce oxygen used by aerobic bacteria for mineralization of organic compounds. In turn, native bacteria provide carbon dioxide necessary for microalgae. Higher pollutant treatment efficiency can be therefore achieved through such the symbiosis 12 , 13 , 14 . Conclusions This study demonstrated that microalgae, bacteria and non-toxic cyanobacteria can be successfully used for the treatment of undiluted and unsterilized liquid digestate. For steady state period, nitrogen and phosphate removal rates reached 89.3 ± 0.5% and 72.8 ± 2.1% respectively. Furthermore, total COD was reduced by 78.9 ± 6.0% whereas soluble COD was lowered by 91.2 ± 1.6%. A significant pH change contributed to the rapid development of cyanobacteria, however nutrient removal efficiency remained at a relatively constant level. No MC-LR and MC-RR microcystin were detected. The investigation also proved that unsterilized, non-diluted liquid digestate can be successfully treated by a mixed consortium of microalgae, cyanobacteria and bacteria, and the growth of the latter two groups can enhance the treatment efficiency, especially the removal of nutrients. Further research is needed to find symbiotic relationships between microalgae, cyanobacteria and bacteria as well as mechanisms of contaminant removal at a proteolytic and metabolomic levels.

By Jenna Bernstein - August 2, 2023 2 Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Linkedin Email Print A previous aerial photo of a cyanobacteria bloom. —Courtesy Circuit Arts Cyanobacteria, a potentially toxic blue-green algae, is no new sight to Islanders, but MV Cyano is now bringing regular, up-to-date monitoring of some of the Island’s freshwater and brackish ponds to the public for two reasons: the first, to monitor the safety of the water for people and animals, and the second, to study and protect the Vineyard’s ponds and ecosystems. Founded only three years ago, MV Cyano monitors cyanobacteria that exist in mixed fresh and salt waters, an area of science that Great Pond Foundation Executive Director Emily Reddington says has little been studied. MV Cyano hopes to keep the public aware of cyanobacteria levels in Island ponds in collaboration with the Great Pond Foundation and the Island boards of health, to promote safety for recreational users. Warming water temperatures and nutrient-rich waters, made richer by nitrogen pollution from septic and agricultural runoff, are the primary contributing factors to these harmful algal blooms, according to Reddington and the foundation’s director of science and collaboration, David Bouck. Cyanobacteria creates a filmy layer or thick mat of algae on the edges and on the surface of freshwater and brackish ponds. Occasionally ponds, like Seth’s Pond, have been closed to the public due to hazardous levels of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria, when it blooms, may produce cyanotoxins, which can create potentially unsafe conditions for humans, pets, and livestock. While there is some risk to swimming and wading, the highest risk comes from ingesting cyanotoxins, for both people and pets. Not all cyanobacteria blooms produce cyanotoxins, and not all green algae lead to the toxic blooms. Not every pond that has a film of green algae is toxic. Knowing the difference is part of the work being done at MV Cyano, Reddington says. “We help the public to differentiate between nontoxic regular things you’d see in the water, and something potentially toxic, like cyanobacteria,” Reddington said. “Not all types of cyanobacteria are toxic, but what MV Cyano does is say, ‘When is there a risk, and what is it?’ so that people can still use the water.” Cyanobacteria can appear in many ways, and can be tricky to diagnose with the eye. “Blooms can look like a blue-green scum, can look filamentous like globby algae, or it can be toxic and the water looks clear,” Reddington said. “That’s why regular monitoring is really important.” Some ponds are monitored on a weekly basis, like Chilmark Pond and Edgartown Great Pond. “It’s serious when you talk about cyanotoxins, and it shouldn’t be taken lightly, but it really depends on the type of toxin present and the concentration. The goal with MV Cyano is to try to get out public information quickly and effectively,” says Reddington. MV Cyano and the Island’s boards of health work in collaboration to put up fliers to advise on the quality of the water and which activities are safe, have some risk, or are not advised. These notices are color-coded in conjunction with the maps uploaded on the website. On both website and flier, green indicates no cyanobacteria detected. The maps and more information on MV Cyano are available at greatpondfoundation.org/mvcyano . James Pond, Mink Meadows, and areas of Tisbury Great Pond and Chilmark Pond are currently displaying advisory levels for cyanobacteria. Reddington also encouraged anyone who suspects a pond not monitored by MV Cyano may have some kind of algae to report it to the town’s board of health. Yellow alerts are common for ponds in the summer, Reddington said. “It just means that cyanobacteria are present, they are measurable. There’s always some risk for a dog, or a jump in the water. Yellow is a normal thing that you often see in summer ponds. It’s just a ‘use some caution,’” Reddington explained. “Orange indicates numbers have come up and that there is a potential harmful algal bloom,” also called a HAB for short, Reddington said. “If they continue to rise it could go to an advisory. It’s telling you that the concentration of cyanobacteria has increased enough to use more caution.” “The only one that says no swimming is the red,” said Reddington, the HABs advisory, but she says in scenarios involving HABs, it’s all about individual risk tolerance. “These are advisories,” said Emily. “No handcuffs.” If walking a dog along a pond with a HABs alert, watch, or advisory, be sure to prevent the dog from drinking the water, as cyanotoxins become more dangerous when ingested. While human disease resulting from HABs is rare, known effects of ingesting cyanotoxins involve neurological problems, with select studies examining a speculative link between HABs and ALS. These toxins are only of concern when present in high concentrations, but shellfish grown in waters experiencing cyanobacteria blooms or alerts should not be consumed. If pond water is visibly bright green, or if there is any sign of a bloom, it is recommended to avoid swimming and avoid eating seafood harvested from the pond until testing confirms toxin levels are safe. Oysters, blue crabs, soft-shell clams, and other shellfish are harvested en masse from ponds around the Island. “The shellfish industry is really important economically and also culturally,” acknowledged Reddington. While cyanobacteria and toxic blooms may be natural, and nothing new, Reddington and Bouck’s mission with MV Cyano is to help keep these dynamic ecosystems in a state of healthy balance. “Last month, July, was the hottest month on record, globally,” says Reddington. “The things that drive blooms are imbalance in the ecosystem, like when it’s super-hot and there’s too much nitrogen or phosphorus feeding the ponds. The more nitrogen and phosphorus we put in the water, and the warmer the temperature, the more likely we are to see future blooms.” In partnership with Falmouth’s Marine Biological Lab, MV Cyano tested four Island ponds using technology that allowed researchers to determine the source of nitrogen, be it naturally occurring or originating from wastewater or fertilizer runoff. “You can actually tell by the nutrient sample where the nitrogen is coming from, and that percentage,” said Reddington. Of the four ponds studied on the Island, more than 50 percent of the nitrogen came from wastewater. The next greatest contributor was fertilizer and other human-introduced nitrogen sources, according to Reddington and the MBL study. “This has been a large discussion in the state of Massachusetts and the Cape specifically, what to do about this nitrogen problem,” said Bouck. “A lot of it comes from wastewater, and probably the majority of that is from septic leach fields and septic tanks.” Because MV Cyano has only been monitoring the ponds for three years, Bouck and Reddington could not comment on any trend indicating increased toxic blooms. They did have some recommendations about things the community could do to lessen the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen humans contribute to the ecosystem. “The simplest thing that we know will help is to stop using fertilizer,” said Reddington. “But that has to be homeowners, that has to be landscapers, that has to be a lot of people choosing not to use fertilizer,” she said, a potentially big ask for the Island’s landscaping and agricultural economies. When it comes to mitigating nitrogen in wastewater runoff, Bouck has been researching innovative alternative systems and technologies that the Island could adopt. “There are many different setups for many different kinds of homes,” he said. Bouck explained that filters can be installed in septic tanks that remove nitrogen from the water before it can make it into the groundwater, decreasing the amount of nitrogen entering water bodies downstream. “Ammonium or nitrate are harmful to ponds; those are forms of nitrogen,” Reddington said. “But this converter converts it to nitrogen gas, which is already plentiful in the air. The goal is to transform harmful nitrogen into harmless nitrogen.” Expanding wastewater treatment plants could also be a good strategy, as Reddington says they are particularly good at removing nitrogen and phosphorus from the water. “It may be easier and more affordable in the long run to do that than to change every single individual septic system in a neighborhood, but it depends on the community,” said Bouck, when speaking of possible future solutions. Reddington commented on the town of Tisbury’s water treatment plans, calling them “innovative in putting forward different solutions and working to get regulations in place and systems tested.” “It’s not required right now on the Island, but it’s probably needed. You can see these blooms are happening,” said Reddington. Reddington and Bouck say there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, should the Island community and towns choose to tackle it. “It’s going to have to be unique to the community, to the watershed, and to the pond itself. That’s why it’s so important to collect this environmental data,” said Reddington. “There’s a lot of beautiful water here we want to protect,” she said.

The bay’s shallow, nutrient-rich, and seasonally warm waters offer ideal growing conditions for the floating, plant-like organisms, which can multiply and aggregate into vast masses that discolor parts of the lake. The summer of 2023 was no exception. The Operational Land Imager (OLI) on Landsat 8 acquired this natural-color image of a bloom swirling near the mouth of the Missisquoi River on September 1, 2023. The satellite collected similar images in August as well. While it is not possible to determine the type of phytoplankton with Landsat observations alone, this bloom is likely cyanobacteria (also called blue-green algae)—an ancient type of marine bacteria that captures and stores solar energy through photosynthesis. Several trained cyanobacteria spotters submitted photographs and reports of dense green mats of cyanobacteria lining the shores of Missisquoi Bay to Verrmont’s cyanobacteria tracker website around the same time the image was acquired. Cyanobacteria blooms are monitored closely because some species produce toxins known as cyanotoxins , including a widespread type called microcystin , that can sicken people and animals, contaminate drinking water, and force closures of boating and swimming sites. In recent years, teams of researchers working with NASA’s DEVELOP program have used observations from several satellites to track where in Lake Champlain harmful blooms are most common and identify key risk factors associated with them. In a technical report , the researchers reported that Missisquoi Bay and nearby St. Albans Bay had the lake’s highest concentration of toxic cyanobacteria blooms between 2016-2022. “There are multiple contributors to blooms like nutrients, temperature, and wind and wave conditions,” noted Kent Ross , a science advisor for the Lake Champlain DEVELOP project. “We focused on the availability of one of the nutrients— phosphorus .” Phosphorus is a common nutrient found in runoff from farmland, lawns, and developed areas. While much of Lake Champlain is surrounded by forests, which filter nutrients, Missisquoi Bay is flanked by farmland, where fertilizer use leads to higher levels of phosphorous in the rivers that flow into the bay, Ross explained. “That’s where our project partner, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Service , comes in,” added Ross. “They recommend best practices to farmers to limit nutrient runoff.” Adjusting the timing or type of fertilizer, changing grazing rotations, upgrading drainage systems, and improving soil health are among the strategies farmers might pursue. One of the challenges for scientists who study cyanobacteria blooms is that blooms don’t always contain the species that produce harmful toxins. “The currently used indices based on multispectral imagery cannot distinguish between the toxin-producing subspecies of microcystis and non-toxin producing microcystis algae blooms,” said Jeffrey Luvall, also a science advisor for the DEVELOP team and a scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. “But the upcoming PACE mission —scheduled to launch in 2024—will make hyperspectral observations able to do that.” NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang , using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey .

The limited outflow of the lake allows for the accumulation of nutrients derived primarily from surrounding communities’ agricultural and sewage waste. The increased nutrient levels can lead to plankton blooms. This astronaut photograph, taken from the International Space Station, captures two such blooms along the eastern shoreline of the lake.

However, the discovery of hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase (HpnP) in Alphaproteobacteria led to the downfall of this molecular proxy. In the present study, we re-examined the distribution of HpnP in a new phylogenetic framework including recently proposed candidate phyla and re-interpreted a revised geological record of 2-methylhopanes based on contamination-free samples. We show that HpnP was probably present in the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria, while the gene appeared in Alphaproteobacteria only around 750 million years ago (Ma). A subsequent rise of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes around 600 Ma probably reflects the expansion of Alphaproteobacteria that coincided with the rise of eukaryotic algae—possibly connected by algal dependency on microbially produced vitamin B 12 . Our findings re-establish 2-methylhopanes as cyanobacterial biomarkers before 750 Ma and thus as a potential tool to measure the importance of oxygenic cyanobacteria as primary producers on early Earth. Our study illustrates how genetics can improve the diagnostic value of biomarkers and refine the reconstruction of early ecosystems.

León-Zayas Main Cyanobacteria played a crucial role in transforming Earth from its initial anoxic state to a modern, oxygenated system, capable of sustaining increasingly complex life 1 , 2 . Because cyanobacteria were presumably the only relevant group of oxygenic primary producers for much of the Precambrian 3 , their fossilized remnants can serve as an indicator for the presence of oxygenic photosynthesis and relative variations in primary production and carbon burial in the geological past. Yet taphonomic alteration and non-quantitative preservation of cyanobacterial microfossils render their use in Precambrian reconstructions complicated 4 . By contrast, lipid molecules from cyanobacterial cellular membranes are less susceptible to taphonomic bias in environments that favour the preservation of organic matter. Thus, fossilized lipids in the form of biomarker hydrocarbons—in this case hopanoids—can provide important semi-quantitative information for reconstructing the ecological importance of cyanobacteria in the deep past 5 , thereby framing the environmental context that is crucially needed for better understanding the evolution of increasingly complex life. Hopanoids are triterpenoid lipids predominantly produced by aerobic bacteria and considered functional analogues of eukaryotic sterols 6 , 7 . In contrast to the overall wide distribution of hopanoids in bacteria, hopanoids methylated at the C-2 position (2-methylhopanoids) have a much narrower taxonomical representation and were once extensively explored as taxon-specific biomarkers for cyanobacteria 8 . A cyanobacterial association was further supported by frequently observed concurrent records of elevated 2-methylhopane abundance and stable nitrogen isotope ratios suggestive of nitrogen fixation 9 , 10 —cyanobacteria being the major diazotrophs in modern oceans 11 . Although the physiological roles of methylhopanoids are not yet fully understood, protective roles against environmental stress have been suggested 12 , 13 . Precambrian rocks were found to generally contain higher proportions of 2-methylated hopanoids relative to Phanerozoic sediments, and this observation was interpreted to reflect an elevated proportion of cyanobacteria as Precambrian primary producers 8 , 14 . Also throughout the Phanerozoic, systematic trends and fluctuations in 2-methylhopane abundances relative to non-methylated regular hopanes (2-methylhopane index; 2-MHI) were widely used as an indicator of environmental stress and cyanobacterial proliferation 9 , 15 . Discovery of hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase (HpnP), however, called such interpretations into question by revealing the capacity for 2-methylhopanoid biosynthesis in both Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria 16 , 17 . It was even suggested that HpnP first evolved within aerobic Alphaproteobacteria 18 and was only later horizontally transferred to Cyanobacteria. These inferences ultimately led to much uncertainty, debate and a questionable utility of ecological proxies involving 2-methylhopanoids. Here we report on the existence of diagnostic time windows for fossil 2-methylhopanes in the geological past. Numerous new bacterial phyla have recently been found to possess hopanoid-producing genes 19 , and this urges a re-evaluation of 2-methylhopanoid distribution in bacteria and their geobiological implications. We re-examined the distribution of HpnP in the bacterial domain and its evolutionary history using up-to-date genomic datasets and an integrated approach towards phylogenetics 20 , 21 . In addition, by now, we know that pervasive contamination can overprint Precambrian lipid signatures, and doubts have been raised about previously published Precambrian biomarker records 22 . Hence, our molecular data were combined with new analyses of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes to provide an integrated account of 2-methylhopane production through Earth history. Results and discussion Hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase in bacteria HpnP is mostly distributed across a subset of bacteria that possess squalene cyclase (SC), which creates the non-methylated hopanoid structure. Nearly all species that possess both the SC and HpnP genes retain only a single copy of each gene. Synteny (gene co-localization) between the SC and HpnP genes was not observed in any phylum, and thus these two genes may be independently inherited. In the current study, SC was found in 31 bacterial phyla, whereas HpnP was found in 12 phyla (Fig. 1a ). This contrasts with only four phyla that were previously known to harbour HpnP-containing species 23 , 24 . Yet, the distribution of SC and HpnP is sporadic in most phyla that contain these two enzymes, and HpnP in particular is concentrated in three phyla: Rokubacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria (Fig. 1a,b ) (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 − 5 provide more details). Rokubacteria is a recently proposed candidate phylum 25 , and its HpnP homologues have not been described thus far. Despite the sporadic occurrence of SC among bacteria, a recent comprehensive phylogenetic study suggests that SC was present in the individual common ancestors of three HpnP-containing phyla (Rokubacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria). This implies multiple events of SC gene loss within individual phyla, and HpnP seems to have followed a similar complex evolutionary history. It is currently not clear what selective pressure caused the loss or retention of the SC and HpnP genes. Fig. 1: Distribution of SC and HpnP in bacteria. a , Distribution in individual bacterial phyla; only phyla that harbour SC are shown. Light yellow colour indicates that only a small number of species possess the gene (below 10% of available genomes). Note that the orange colour does not necessarily mean the gene is ubiquitous in a phylum. Individual proteobacterial classes are treated as phyla in the main text.

Supplementary Tables 1 − 5 provide the details within individual families. Full size image HpnP phylogenetic analysis The evolutionary relationship of HpnP in 12 bacterial phyla was examined through phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 − 3 ). HpnP forms a monophyletic group among multiple clades of uncharacterized HpnP-like proteins (HpnP clade; Fig. 2 , insert). HpnP and HpnP-like proteins broadly retain three conserved domains: a B-12 binding domain, a radical SAM domain and a domain of unknown function (DUF4070). Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) dependency of HpnP was recently experimentally confirmed 24 , and our results suggest this cobalamin dependency is a general characteristic of HpnP homologues. Other distant homologues with a radical SAM domain do not retain all three conserved domains. Currently, methyltransferase activity is confirmed only for several proteins in the HpnP clade, and thus it is unknown if HpnP-like proteins are even involved in hopanoid (or more generally terpenoid) biosynthesis. Individual clades of HpnP and HpnP-like proteins display different taxonomical distributions and the tree topology within those clades generally does not follow the species tree at the phylum level. Some species were found to possess multiple HpnP homologies, in addition to HpnP. For instance, many cyanobacteria possess two HpnP homologues—HpnP and an uncharacterized HpnP-like protein. The latter was once thought to be HpnP 26 , but this was later corrected 24 . Those HpnP-like proteins serve as outgroup sequences in the present study. Fig. 2: Maximum likelihood tree of HpnP protein sequences. The tree was generated using 135 representative sequences and 534 conserved sites. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% for both maximum likelihood inference and Bayesian inference (node support is shown only for major clades). Filled grey circles indicate that the node support is above the same threshold for one of the two inferences. The presence/absence of the SC gene is indicated next to the tree. The insert displays major clades of HpnP homologues (HpnP and HpnP-like proteins) that retain three conserved domains; B-12 binding domain, radical SAM domain and DUF4070 domain. The scale bar represents 0.4 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Supplementary Figs. 1 − 3 provide the complete trees with the species annotation. Full size image The deepest-branching HpnP homologues in the HpnP clade were obtained from Deltaproteobacteria (myxobacteria, in particular) that do not possess SC in their genomes (Fig. 2 ). This suggests that deltaproteobacterial HpnP homologues are not involved in hopanoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Note 2 ). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that deltaproteobacteria containing HpnP homologues may acquire and methylate non-methylated hopanoid precursors from the environment. Except for Deltaproteobacteria, most bacteria that possess an early-diverging HpnP homologue also possess SC, and those bacteria presumably (although not experimentally confirmed) have the ability to produce 2-methylhopanoids. Currently, 2-methylhopanoid production has been confirmed only for the three late-branching phyla: Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria 8 , 27 , 28 . Thus, characterization of early-diverging HpnP homologues from other bacterial phyla, including Deltaproteobacteria, may provide important information about the functional evolution of radical SAM methyltransferases towards HpnP. Focusing on HpnP proteins accompanied by SC, the tree topology does not replicate the known relationships between bacterial phyla and a complex history of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is inferred (Fig. 2 ). However, Cyanobacteria, Rokubacteria and Alphaproteobacteria are well separated with robust nodal support by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferences (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ), and no sign of recent HGT is observed. This suggests that the HGT events at the root of those sub-clades are ancient and the bacterial lineages that mediated those transfers (but were not necessarily producing 2-methylhopaonids themselves) are long extinct. Whereas HpnP sequences from Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominate our dataset, the evolutionary pattern seen in the two clades is distinct. Alphaproteobacterial sequences come from a sporadic number of sub-clades, suggesting HpnP emerged late in the group, while cyanobacterial sequences largely mirror the species tree, suggesting HpnP was inherited vertically in crown-group cyanobacteria. These observed patterns are described in more detail below. Evolution of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria Unlike in previous studies that were based on more limited datasets 16 , 18 , alphaproteobacterial HpnP homologues do not form a monophyletic clade but instead cluster together with homologues from Acidobacteria and the newly proposed candidate phylum Eremiobacterota (Fig. 2 ). Hence, it is not clear if HpnP appeared only once in Alphaproteobacteria and was later horizontally transferred to the other phyla or if Alphaproteobacteria received HpnP through multiple HGT events from different sources. The two alphaproteobacterial clades are taxonomically distinct. One clade mostly consists of the family Methylobacteriaceae and some unclassified alphaproteobacteria, while the other principally contains Beijerinckiaceae and Nitrobacteraceae (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). These three alphaproteobacterial families belong to the same order Hyphomicrobiales (formerly Rhizobiales), while HpnP is nearly absent in other families (17 families in total; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). Further, the observed HpnP tree topology is not consistent with the currently inferred species tree of Hyphomicrobiales (Extended Data Fig. 1 ), and HpnP is nearly absent from other alphaproteobacterial orders (Fig. 1b ). Thus, we infer that HpnP was horizontally transferred to Alphaproteobacteria only after the divergence of Hyphomicrobiales, possibly multiple times independently. Evolution of HpnP in Cyanobacteria In contrast to Alphaproteobacteria, the HpnP branching order in Cyanobacteria broadly matches the species tree, despite the overall distribution of HpnP being sporadic at the species level (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4 ). For instance, HpnP is found in two early-branching taxa ( Gloeobacter and Gloeomargarita ), and HpnP homologues from these taxa also branch early in the cyanobacterial HpnP tree. Here we examined the evolutionary history of cyanobacterial HpnP through reconciliation analyses of its tree topology. The reconciliation between the cyanobacterial HpnP tree and the species tree suggests that early-branching orders of the HpnP tree are well consistent with the species tree, while multiple transfer events of the HpnP gene seem to have occurred in individual sub-clades (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 ). The frequency of HGT is estimated to be no higher than ~15% (13 out of 86 branches) within HpnP-containing cyanobacterial species. Some putative transfer events are likely to be artefacts due to an inaccurate tree topology with low node supports and the heterotachy of some sub-clades in the HpnP tree (for example, weak node supports for the lineage that splits from Neosynechococcus ; Fig. 3 ). The absence of HpnP in the majority of cyanobacteria is attributed to gene loss that seems to have occurred multiple times independently in major lineages (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 3 for detailed discussions). Our results suggest that HpnP was present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and was subsequently vertically inherited, with multiple gene loss events and potentially some transfers within the phylum. SC has similarly been inferred to have been present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and vertically inherited 19 . However, this does not necessarily mean that SC and HpnP co-evolved, because no synteny is observed between the SC and HpnP genes. The ability to produce C-2 methylated hopanoids was thus probably present in the common ancestor of crown-group cyanobacteria, which contrasts with the here inferred late origin of alphaproteobacterial 2-methylhopanoid production (Supplementary Note 4 provides comparison with previous studies). Fig. 3: Maximum likelihood tree of HpnP in Cyanobacteria. A species tree that contained 44 representative cyanobacterial species (Supplementary Fig. 4 ) was compared to the HpnP tree through reconciliation analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5 for the comparison result and HGT inference by the reconciliation analysis software Notung). Solid lines in the HpnP tree indicate that they are consistent with the species tree. Dashed lines indicate that they are not consistent with the species tree, and thus the presence of HGT is inferred by Notung. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% for both maximum likelihood inference and Bayesian inference (node support is shown only for major clades). Filled grey circles indicate that the node support is above the same threshold for one of the two inferences. The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Full size image 2-Methylhopanoids as aerobiosis biomarkers The distribution of HpnP is nearly exclusive to obligate and facultative aerobes, even though the HpnP catalysis itself does not require molecular oxygen. HpnP-containing species constitute a subset of SC-containing bacteria, which are also mostly aerobes, although SC is additionally found in several anaerobic lineages (for example, Brocadiales, Desulfovibrionales) 29 , 30 . Hence, fossilized 2-methylhopanoids (2-methylhopanes) in the geological record are probable markers for aerobic bacteria and thus aerobic environments. This is consistent with an environmental survey that associated HpnP with microaerobic environments 17 . HpnP most likely evolved in, or was acquired by, stem-group cyanobacteria after the split from non-photosynthetic lineages (for example, Melainabacteria, Margulisbacteria; HpnP absent). In this framework, the analysis of geological 2-methylhopane records as aerobiosis markers potentially enables us to address the timing of incipient oxygen production before the onset of the GOE at ~2.4 billion years ago (Ga) as was originally proposed 8 , regardless of the phylogenetic identity of the biological host, if thermally well-preserved sedimentary sequences should ever be found 22 . Source of fossilized 2-methylhopanoids Understanding the evolutionary timeline of HpnP in individual phyla, in particular Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Rokubacteria, allows constraining the source of 2-methylhopanoids at different geological times. HpnP in additional bacteria suggests that Cyanobacteria was not the only lineage capable of producing 2-methylhopanoids. However, HpnP appears only sporadically in those additional lineages, possibly reflecting relatively recent HGT events or limited microbial sampling. Similarly, the presence of these proteins at the base of the HpnP tree could represent long branch attraction of proteins that are dissimilar from the better sampled clades (Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria)—perhaps representing a divergent function—or they could represent ancestry from an extinct lineage with an ancestral form of HpnP that was not necessarily involved in 2-methylhopanoid production, as implied for deltaproteobacterial HpnP homologues. We currently do not have enough data to adjudicate between these competing interpretations. Nevertheless, accepting these limitations, we can conclude that 2-methylhopanoid biosynthesis existed in Cyanobacteria before it appeared within Alphaproteobacteria. The evolutionary history of Rokubacteria is not constrained, and it remains unclear if any members actually produce geologically relevant amounts of 2-methylhopanoids. Rokubacteria are neither primary producers, nor have they been detected in marine settings. Also, rokubacterial HpnP seems confined to several late-branching clades, although the exact timing of HpnP acquisition is not clear (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 7 − 9 ). Hence, it appears unlikely that Rokubacteria substantially contributed to the Precambrian marine biomarker record. The same applies to other sporadic occurrences of HpnP discussed above. In contrast, cyanobacteria are generally accepted as important primary producers that substantially contributed to organic carbon burial throughout the mid-Proterozoic 3 , 31 . Also, our genome data reveal that HpnP is in fact distributed much more widely in marine cyanobacteria than previously known 23 (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Note 5 for more details). Therefore, cyanobacteria are the most likely source of fossilized 2-methylhopanoids before the evolution of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria (Hyphomicrobiales). Constraining the emergence of HpnP-containing Hyphomicrobiales then provides a means to determine geological periods and formations with (nearly) exclusively cyanobacterial signatures. The evolutionary timeline of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria was estimated using recently published phylogenomic analyses of Hyphomicrobiales (Fig. 4a ) 32 . This published dated phylogeny suggests that Hyphomicrobiales emerged around 1.5 Ga (node number 4 in Fig. 4a ), while the emergence of the stem groups of three major HpnP-containing families occurred only after 750 Ma (number 5 in Fig. 4a ; nodes a, b and c). The phylogenetic relationship between those families in the HpnP tree is not consistent with the species tree of Hyphomicrobiales, as described above (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Thus, the HpnP gene was probably horizontally transferred to those three families after 750 Ma. In contrast, HpnP is widespread within the individual three families, suggesting the presence of HpnP in the common ancestors of each of those individual families. The divergence of those three families is estimated to have occurred after 500 Ma (Fig. 4a ; three triangles in red) 32 . Therefore, the emergence of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria can be estimated to having occurred between the emergence of the stem groups and the divergence of the crown groups of three HpnP-containing families, somewhere between 750 and 500 Ma (node number 5; Fig. 4a ). In turn, fossilized 2-methylhopanoids in marine sedimentary rocks deposited before 750 Ma probably indicate cyanobacterial sources.

Both the tree topology and the node dates were adapted from a recent phylogenomic study (Supplementary Fig. 10 ) 32 . Numbers in the tree indicate major evolutionary events for the two phyla Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria: (1) divergence of crown-group cyanobacteria; (2) divergence of Alphaproteobacteria from Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria; (3) divergence of crown-group Alphaproteobacteria; (4) divergence of Hyphomicrobiales; (5) divergence of HpnP-containing Hyphomicrobiales families—Beijerinckiaceae (node a), Methylobacteriaceae (node b) and Nitrobacteraceae (node c). Nodes a, b and c indicate the emergence of three HpnP-containing families in Hyphomicrobiales. Node bars denote the 95% highest posterior density interval of posterior dates.

Each circle and square represent the average of all 2-MHI values from individual geological formations or published studies (Supplementary Table 7 ).

Full size image Non-contaminated 2-methylhopane record in the Precambrian The record of the 2-methylhopane index (2-MHI) published thus far is generally characterized by high values in Precambrian rocks and oils (up to 19%), relative to those in younger organic matter, and an elevated proportion of cyanobacterial primary production was thus inferred for the early Earth 8 , 14 . However, the syngeneity (analytes having the same age as the host rock) of 2-methylhopanes in Precambrian samples has never been adequately and systematically assessed. By now, it is widely recognized that even traces of contamination can pose a serious problem for organic-lean Precambrian samples, as was previously scrutinized for Archaean biomarker studies 22 . Hence, we re-investigated Precambrian rocks using rigorous slice-extraction and interior–exterior experiments, allowing us to separately study non-contaminated sample interiors and contamination-prone sample exteriors (surfaces) 22 , 33 . Our analyses revealed that high 2-MHI values are restricted to sample exteriors—up to 17% in the 1.64 Ga Barney Creek Formation that hosts the oldest known 2-MHI record 33 (Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Table 6 )—whereas non-contaminated interiors exhibit 2-MHI values with an average of 1.1% ( n = 42) and a maximum of only 2.4% (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). Abiotic hopanoid methylation at the position C-2 is highly unlikely (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 12 ). As our results highlight the need for a systematic re-evaluation of Precambrian 2-methylhopane abundances, we compiled a new non-contaminated 2-MHI record based on newly analysed rock samples from the Phanerozoic to the Paleoproterozoic that underwent syngeneity assessment ( n = 161), combined with previously published 2-MHI values, excluding any potentially contaminated samples from the pre-Ediacaran period ( n = 507) (Supplementary Table 7 ). In contrast to previous findings, the revised 2-MHI record exhibits consistently low relative 2-methylhopane abundances until the end of the Snowball Earth glaciations around 635 Ma (2-MHI < 2.4%; n = 93; average = 0.96%) (Fig. 4b ). An initial increase to 5.4% is observed in the early Ediacaran ( ~ 620 Ma) and followed by multiple episodes of large fluctuations. While the 2-MHI in the Ediacaran and Phanerozoic can be extremely high for individual formations (up to 24%), the averaged values over geological time units remain moderate at ~5%. Ecological implications of 2-methylhopanes Comparatively low 2-MHI values (~1%) in the mid-Proterozoic represent the average contribution of cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoids to mid-Proterozoic sediments and provide a baseline for gauging the activity of cyanobacteria, even though the 2-methylhopanoid production by marine cyanobacteria seems to be confined to nearshore environments 34 , 35 (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Note 8 for detailed discussions). The ‘rise of algae’ in the Cryogenian that broke the billion-year incumbency of cyanobacteria was attributed to a changing nutrient regime, which was triggered by massive glaciogenic inputs of phosphorus into oceans and allowed eukaryotic algae to permanently outcompete cyanobacteria 3 . Ecological shifts throughout the Ediacaran period—diminished abundances of microbial mats 36 , 37 and the expansion of HpnP-free cyanobacteria as major primary producers in pelagic regions (Extended Data Fig. 2 )—should have curtailed net cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoid productions and preservations. This draws particular attention to the unexpected Ediacaran increase of the 2-MHI that probably reflects the emergence of non-cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoid sources that may have played an important ecological role in Ediacaran oceans (Fig. 4b ). Combining the biomarker record with time-calibrated genetic analyses points to the emergence of this lipid biosynthetic capacity in Alphaproteobacteria as an explanation (500–750 Ma; Fig. 4a ). This inference is consistent with recent studies that proposed Alphaproteobacteria as the major source of Phanerozoic 2-methylhopanes 23 , 24 and also the dominance of alphaproterobacterial HpnP genes in many modern marine metagenomes 17 (Supplementary Notes 4 and 5 ). Hence, it is likely that the Ediacaran increase of the 2-MHI reflects the expansion of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria. We hypothesize that this dynamic shift in 2-methylhopanoid producers and the rise of algae proceeded in concert. It is well known that eukaryotes depend on symbiotic microbes for nutrient acquisition and have co-evolved with those symbionts, as observed for algae, plants and animals 38 , 39 . For instance, eukaryotes cannot biosynthesize vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) de novo, although the majority of green algae require this nutrient for the biosynthesis of the essential amino acid methionine (Supplementary Note 9 ) 40 . Dissolved oceanic vitamin B 12 concentrations are generally too low to sustain the growth of algae, which thus rely on the uptake of microbially produced vitamin B 12 (ref. 40 ). Vitamin B 12 dependency evolved in several algal lineages independently during the course of evolution, through developing mutualistic relationships with microbial donors and retaining an efficient vitamin B 12 -dependent methionine synthase 40 . In modern environments, dominant vitamin B 12 contributors to algae are Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria 41 , 42 that utilize an oxygen-dependent pathway for vitamin B 12 biosynthesis 41 , whose presence is predicted for many HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria (Supplementary Table 3 ). Hence, an expansion of vitamin B 12 -producing Alphaproteobacteria in mutualistic relationship with algae during the Ediacaran may be one factor tying the steep rise of 2-MHI values to the rise of algae (Supplementary Note 9 for more details). The elevated 2-MHI may additionally reflect an increased reworking of newly available algal biomass in increasingly oxygenated marine environments by heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria. These hypotheses are complementary to the previously proposed relationship between 2-methylhopanoid production and the nitrogen cycle during Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (Supplementary Note 4 ) 23 , 24 . In view of enhanced alphaproteobacterial 2-methylhopanoid production going back to the Ediacaran, it is likely that HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria were responsible for modulating the 2-MHI throughout the Phanerozoic. Conclusions The once suggested association of 2-methylhopanoids with cyanobacteria—a highly important proxy tool for our understanding of Earth system evolution and oxygen dynamics in the geological past—has been constantly debated. Both Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria can biosynthesize 2-methylhopanoids, and thus sedimentary 2-methylhopanes are not a diagnostic biomarker for a single taxonomic group. We show that such ambiguities can be refined by adding a genetic perspective. The phylogenetic tree topology of HpnP in Cyanobacteria suggests that HpnP was probably present in the common ancestor of crown-group cyanobacteria, whereas according to molecular clock analyses alphaproteobacterial lineages acquired HpnP after 750 Ma. This finding re-establishes the utility of 2-methylhopanes as a biomarker for cyanobacteria in pre-Ediacaran rocks, enabling us to measure the importance of HpnP-containing oxygenic cyanobacteria in the geological past. By contrast, 2-methylhopanes in post-Cryogenian oceans reflect additional signals from heterotrophic 2-methylhopanoid producers—Alphaproteobacteria. The synchronization between the 2-MHI increase during the Ediacaran and the ecological expansion of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria and eukaryotic algae may not be coincidental, involving a vitamin B 12 -based mutualistic relationship between Alphaproteobacteria and algae and enhanced reworking of algal biomass by Alphaproteobacteria in increasingly oxygenated marine environments. Our study demonstrates the strength of combining the geological record of fossil hydrocarbon biomarkers with genetic analyses to gain insights into ancient ecosystems and provides an important precedent for refining our understanding of biomarker utility throughout Earth’s history. Methods Bioinformatics analyses HpnP dataset construction Representative sequences for hopanoid biosynthesis enzymes were identified from UniProt ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ); HpnP ( B3QHD1 ), SC ( P33247 ). These protein sequences were utilized as seeds to identify homologous sequences in all three domains of life. Sequences were retrieved from GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), using BLASTp and PSI-Blast 43 , 44 , with the cut-off threshold of <1 × 10 −5 . Taxonomically redundant sequences were excluded. Protein domain identification was performed using HMMER v3.3.1 (ref. 45 ) with the PFAM-A database ( http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz ). Phylogenetic analysis Sequences were aligned using Muscle v3.8.31 (ref. 46 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by maximum likelihood inference using IQ-TREE v2.1.06 (ref. 47 ) and by Bayesian inference using MrBayes v3.2.6 (ref. 48 ). Substitution models were selected using ModelFinder in IQ-TREE−LG matrix with empirical frequencies estimated from the data ( F ) and the FreeRate model for rate heterogeneity across sites ( R ). For maximum likelihood inference, branch support was obtained by Ultrafast bootstrap in IQ-TREE. For Bayesian inference, two Markov chain Monte Carlo chains were run for at least 1,000,000 generations until the maximum discrepancy between chains was <0.05. A consensus tree was generated from two chains using a burn-in of 10% of sampled points. In initial analyses, several protein sequences were found to display high sensitivity to sequence alignments and instable positioning in generated trees (accession numbers PYX91820 and HBG07613 ). These sequences were excluded from the subsequent analyses. Cyanobacterial species tree construction and gene tree/species tree reconciliation The list of cyanobacterial species with HpnP proteins was used to create a species tree. The species names were converted into taxon IDs using the NCBI Taxonomy name/id Status Report Page ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/TaxIdentifier/tax_identifier.cgi ). These IDs were used with the research command line utility 49 to download all proteins for each taxon in NCBI’s Identical Protein Group (IGP) database. Single-copy orthologous proteins were identified in these IGP datasets using OrthoFinder v2.5.4 (ref. 50 ). OrthoFinder identified 34 single-copy orthologue groups, which were individually aligned using MUSCLE 46 and then concatenated together into a supermatrix using FASconCAT-G 51 . The species tree was generated from this supermatrix using IQ-TREE, including details of each protein’s beginning and end in the supermatrix alignment. We allowed IQ-TREE to determine the best model of amino acid evolution for each protein in the supermatrix individually before performing maximum likelihood inference. Once the species tree was generated, we compared how the topology of the cyanobacterial HpnP gene tree matched with the species tree using NOTUNG v2.9 tree reconciliation (DTL model) 52 . Rokubacteria species tree construction and gene tree/species tree reconciliation The phylum currently contains only metagenomic samples, and thus the same species tree construction as performed for cyanobacteria was not possible. Instead, a species tree was constructed by concatenating three ribosomal proteins L2, L3 and L4 (Supplementary Table 1 ), using IQ-TREE. The best substitution model was also determined by IQ-TREE. The topology of the rokubacterial HpnP tree was compared with the generated species tree using NOTUNG v2.9 (DTL model). Biomarker analyses Selection of previous biomarker studies Previous studies that are included in our dataset are summarized in Supplementary Table 7 (black colour). Phanerozoic samples are generally organic rich, and thus the influence of trace contamination overprint is probably negligible in most cases. Moreover, a much higher density of available datapoints minimizes the risk of interpreting outliers and unrepresentative samples. Therefore, samples were selected to uniformly cover the whole Phanerozoic period without considering the syngeneity of observed biomarkers. In contrast, Precambrian samples are mostly organic lean and thus are easily overprinted by trace contamination as shown for samples from the 1.64 Ga McArthur Basin (Supplementary Note 6 ). To minimize uncertainty due to contamination, Precambrian samples in our dataset consist mostly of our newly analysed samples, except for Ediacaran oil samples that are highly organic rich and difficult to substantially adulterate through contamination overprint. Biomarker extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy measurement Samples that were newly analysed in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 7 (highlighted in red). Biomarkers were extracted using interior–exterior and slice-extraction experiments as previously described 22 , 53 . For the interior–exterior experiments, rock samples were cut into two portions using a diamond saw—the exterior (exposed surface; approximately 3 mm thickness) and the interior (inner core). Slice-extraction experiments are an extension of the interior–exterior experiments, and rocks were cut into more than two slices to analyse the millimetre-scale distribution of biomarkers. Each slice was crushed independently with a stainless-steel puck mill and bitumen extracted with a Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE 200) using dichloromethane (DCM) for GR7 samples 33 and 90:10% DCM:methanol for LV09001 samples. Saturated fractions were eluted with 1.5 dead volumes n -hexane on a microcolumn of annealed (300 °C, 12 h) and dry-packed silica gel. D4-C 29 αααR-ethylcholestane (D4; Chiron Laboratories AS) was added to the saturate fraction before gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analyses with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 60 m DB-5 MS capillary column (0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness; Agilent Technologies) coupled to a Micromass Autospec Premier double sector mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). Hopanes were analysed with M + (412 for C 30 hopanes)→ m / z 191 and methylhopanes with M + → m / z 205 multiple reaction monitoring transitions. 2-Methylhopane peak assignment was based on the retention time and the comparison with the Australian Geological Survey Organisation standard. Using a DB-5 MS capillary column, C 31 2-methylhopane elutes just before C 30 αβ hopane on the chromatogram. Pyrolysis Aliquots (1 mg) of diplopterol (courtesy of P. Adam and P. Schaeffer, University of Strasbourg), 5α(H)-cholestanol (≥95%, Sigma-Aldrich) or cholesterol (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were transferred to glass tubes flame sealed at one end (Duran, 8 mm diameter, 1 mm wall thickness) dissolved in DCM. After DCM evaporation, ~20 mg active carbon (Sigma-Aldrich, DARCO, 100 mesh particle size, CAS: 7440-44-0) was added, tubes were evacuated to ≤300 mTorr and flame sealed with a gas torch. After pyrolysis in an oven at 300 °C for 24 h, tubes were cooled to room temperature, cracked open and the active carbon was transferred with sequential solvent rinses of n -hexane, DCM and methanol onto a small silica plug in a 4 ml solid phase extraction glass tube and subsequently extracted with about 10 ml n -hexane, 10 ml DCM and at least 4 ml methanol. Once solvents were evaporated under a stream of N 2 , the pyrolysate was applied onto a silica gel microcolumn (about 500 mg in a glasswool-plugged Pasteur pipette), and the saturated hydrocarbon fraction was eluted with 1.5 dead volumes n -hexane followed by GC–MS analysis. Pyrolysates were analysed on a Thermo Quantum XLS Ultra triple-quadrupole MS coupled to a Thermo Trace GC Ultra fitted with a VF-1 MS column (40 m, 0.15 mm i.d., 0.15 μm film thickness).

Extended data Extended Data Fig. 1 Evolutionary relationship of alphaproteobacterial HpnP proteins. Three major HpnP-containing families are shown in the two alphaproteobacterial sub-clades within the HpnP tree (Methylobacteriaceae, Nitrobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae). The inset indicates the species relationship between the three Hyphomicrobiales families 32 . See Supplementary Fig. 1 for the complete tree with the species annotation. Extended Data Fig. 2 Evolution of the extant lineages of marine planktonic cyanobacteria and its relationship to HpnP gene loss. HpnP was likely lost long before the emergence of extant planktonic marine species. The dated species tree is adapted from a recent molecular clock study (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for the original figure with the species annotation) 54 . Presence/absence of HpnP in individual sub-clades was inferred from Supplementary Table 5 and recently-published phylogenomic studies of Cyanobacteria 55 , 56 . Inference for the vertical inheritance of the HpnP gene (solid line) is based on Fig. 3 . Several representative HpnP-containing species are shown next to the corresponding clades. Asterisks indicate that the species is closely related to the corresponding clade, but is not included in the dataset in the cited study. Light blue circles indicate the possible timing of HpnP gene loss in the lineages that include modern marine planktonic species. It is noted that the timing of HpnP gene loss is possibly even earlier, depending on the actual HpnP evolutionary history in Cyanobacteria (dashed lines; vertical inheritance vs. horizontal transfer). Figure adapted from ref. 54 under a Creative Commons license CC BY 4.0 . Extended Data Fig. 3 Distribution of HpnP in Rokubacteria. A species tree that contained 56 representative rokubacterial species (Supplementary Fig. 7 ) was compared to the HpnP tree (Supplementary Fig. 8 ) through Notung reconciliation analyses (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Solid lines in the HpnP tree indicate that they are consistent with the species tree. Dashed lines indicate that they are not consistent with the species tree and thus the presence of HGT is inferred by Notung. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% (node support is shown only for major clades). The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Extended Data Fig. 4 Stratigraphic trend of the 2-MHI. 2-MHI values were calculated for the Paleoproterozoic LV09001 drill core from the McArthur Basin in Northern Australia ( ~ 1.64 Ga) (see also Supplementary Note 6 ). Representative chromatograms for non-methylated hopanes (C 30 diahopanes, C 30 & C 31 hopanes) and methylhopanes (2α and 3β) are shown (478.2 m depth). C 31 2-methylhopane elutes just prior to C 30 αβ-hopane on a DB-5 MS capillary column. Chromatograms are annotated by Metastable Reaction Monitoring (MRM) precursor → products pairs. Percentages provide relative heights of the largest peaks in the chromatograms.

Seasonal blooms of dense algae plague the small subalpine watershed that's butted up against the Continental Divide. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) SHOSHONE NATIONAL FOREST—Kelsee Hurshman stepped carefully into the shallows of subalpine Upper Brooks Lake high in the Absaroka Range. The lake bottom was muck, and the water looked nasty — pea soup colored, with a bunch of floating thingies. The green, detritus-filled cove was nothing a healthy person would think of drinking from, but a thirsty dog probably wouldn’t hesitate. And this is just what the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality employee from Cheyenne was looking for. The 9,100-foot-high backcountry basin has a history of harmful cyanobacterial — commonly called blue-green algae — blooms . Officials advised the public of a bloom , starting on Aug. 24. Wading in about a month later, Hurshman sought to see if the water contained enough cyanobacteria-associated toxins to warrant an additional advisory. “I’m collecting a few different samples,” said Hurshman, DEQ’s harmful cyanobacteria coordinator. Quickly and quietly, she bottled up the algae-choked water. The remnants of a potentially toxic cyanobacteria bloom linger in a cove of Upper Brooks Lake in September 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) Thank you for supporting us in our first 16 years! As we celebrate 16 years of reporting about and for Wyoming, we especially appreciate the supporting members who have made this work possible. If you're able, please consider an additional ""sweet 16"" birthday gift to sustain WyoFile in the years to come! Give here! It was Sept. 20, and Hurshman was sampling with a couple DEQ colleagues and Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber. The team logged the species of cyanobacteria present, where it was in the water column (the surface) and its color (green). Over the course of the day, they’d hike by all the named lakes in the small watershed pressed up against the Continental Divide: first, Brooks Lake, then Upper Brooks, Rainbow and Lower and Upper Jade lakes. Rimmed by Sublette Peak, the Breccia Cliffs and the Pinnacle Buttes, the stunning chain of lakes lies entirely in the national forest. They are remote, usually free from human presence and appear pristine. At a glance, one would never associate these picture-postcard-worthy high-altitude lakes with contamination. Yet they are dogged by nutrient problems and cyanobacteria blooms. “All of the named lakes have had blooms over advisory levels,” Gerber said, “and two of them have had toxins over advisory levels.” Many unknowns A mysterious environmental influence — or combination of factors — is believed to be triggering the blooms. There are theories, but DEQ employee Ron Steg, who leads the agency’s Lander office, is clear: There’s no saying exactly why cyanobacteria are striking this area every summer. “This particular watershed, the geology is high in phosphate,” Steg said. “It could be atmospheric deposition. We don’t know, and that’s why we are studying this.” Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffers Kelsee Hurshman, Ron Steg and Jillian Scott check out the shoreline of Brooks Lake Creek just below the outflow from Upper Brooks Lake. Although the water flows through a remote, wild, high-altitude landscape, the watershed is plagued by potentially harmful algal blooms. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) The DEQ is specifically examining what’s going on in the Brooks Lake watershed in detail because its 234-acre namesake lake has struggled with algal blooms that, on the worst occasions, have been implicated in fish kills so severe that fish went belly up miles downstream in the Wind River. Since 2018, Brooks Lake has occupied a slot on the Wyoming DEQ’s “impaired list.” At one time, fingers were pointed at Brooks Lake Lodge and its formerly surface-discharging sewage lagoon, but problems with nutrients and cyanobacterial blooms higher in the watershed have led to a more holistic investigation. The Brooks Lake watershed, however, isn’t the only place in Wyoming where people and their pets are finding harmful cyanobacteria blooms in unlikely places. Late last October, the Wyoming Department of Health issued a recreation advisory for the Wind River after a 10-pound puppy died within minutes of drinking flowing river water near the Upper Wind River Campground. Campers be forewarned: there are fall 2023 cyanobacteria toxin advisories in place for both the upper and lower Wind River campgrounds, plus in the Wind River immediately below Boysen Reservoir and two areas in the reservoir itself. “It sounded like the animal wasn’t taken to the vet because the dog died so quickly,” Lindsay Patterson, DEQ’s surface water quality standards coordinator, said of the 2022 puppy death. A species of cyanobacteria that resembles grass clippings floats in the water near the Brooks Lake boat ramp in September 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) Those types of fast-acting cyanobacteria dog deaths can happen when canines ingest chunks of “mat-forming blooms.” Water quality specialists don’t know if one of the harmful mats came off Boysen Reservoir, flowed past the dam and stayed intact enough to still be deadly when the puppy encountered it a mile downstream, or if the mat formed in the Wind River itself. Late summer and early fall are typically when cyanobacterial blooms are most likely to occur, but that’s not always the case. WyoFile is turning 16!

Three months later DEQ officials were still able to sample cyanobacteria in densities that exceeded the recreational standard. “We went back and looked at the satellite imagery from before and it looked really, really bad,” Hurshman said. “We suspect it may have persisted.” Then there’s the backcountry. Cyanobacteria blooms are often associated with abundances of nutrients, like fertilizer from agriculture, and warm water typically found at lower elevations. So why are blooms showing up in places like Togwotee Pass? Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber leads Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffers Kelsee Hurshman, Ron Steg and Jillian Scott past Brooks Lake on the hike to Upper Brooks Lake, part of a years-long investigation into nutrient imbalances and seasonal algal blooms that plague the high-elevation watershed. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) Gerber, the Shoshone National Forest hydrologist, doesn’t have any firm answers, but she has noticed a trend within the 17 waterbodies on the national forest where cyanobacteria have been detected in high enough concentrations to warrant an advisory. All of them except for one, she said, are located in the Absaroka Volcanic formation — which suggests a component of the geology could be a contributing factor. Finding new hazards That’s not to say that potentially harmful blue-green algae blooms are restricted to those 17 lakes on the Shoshone National Forest. The hazard could be much more widespread, but documenting each instance with limited staff and time isn’t practical. “We can’t go to all the lakes every year,” Gerber said. This year Gerber went in to test three new lakes in the East Dunoir Creek watershed on the hunch that there might be blooms because lakes in an adjoining watershed — West Dunoir Creek — have had issues. “Two of those water bodies had blooms above advisory levels,” Gerber said. The DEQ’s website currently lists advisories for North and South Watkins lakes. Judging by the DEQ’s interactive advisory map alone, which is cataloged by year, known harmful cyanobacterial blooms are rapidly increasing in Wyoming waters. As recently as 2017 there were only three advisories in the entire state. By 2020 the list grew to 21 lakes statewide. Even after a long-lasting winter and cool spring — conditions that theoretically keep blooms at bay — there have already been 47 advisories posted so far in 2023. Cyanobacteria blooms in densities above advisory levels have been documented in all corners of Wyoming during 2023. (Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality) There’s evidence, however, that the increase is not strictly a symptom of environmental change. Increased reporting by a better-educated populace that now knows what to look for appears to be contributing to the rise in numbers. What might have just looked like a scummy pond in the yesteryear is now reported, sampled, tested and classified as a waterbody with a cyanobacterial bloom advisory. Anne’s Pond, for example, a tiny algae-choked feature on a hiking trail south of Jackson, now shows up with an advisory on the DEQ’s website. And an unnamed “Palmer Creek Trail Pond,” just a few miles away, is under investigation. Research backs up the claim that the increase in known cyanobacteria blooms is a product of looking harder and testing for it. The DEQ recently funded University of Wyoming research that evaluated 40 years of satellite imagery, including 200 lakes in Wyoming. “That study seems to indicate that we’re probably getting better at identifying blooms and there’s more awareness,” Patterson said, “rather than that we’re seeing a really large increase in the blooms.” Cyanotoxins, she said, were pretty much unknown to most people until Toledo, Ohio’s drinking water was affected in 2014. “At water quality management agencies, some people were doing some monitoring here and there,” Patterson said. “But it was not like the robust programs that you see now.” Scaling up That holds true for the Wyoming DEQ. Hurshman’s position didn’t exist until around 2018, and it’s become progressively more focused on harmful cyanobacteria monitoring , Patterson said. In 2021 the agency began a routine monitoring program that prioritizes water where people tend to recreate, and where blooms are most likely to produce toxins. This year they brought on an intern also devoted to the monitoring cause. Hurshman also conducts routine satellite monitoring of 40 of the state’s lakes and reservoirs, which allows her to track the seasonal evolution of blooms — and feed data into the interagency Cyanobacteria Assessment Network . The gloved hand of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffer Kelsee Hurshman, the agency’s harmful cyanobacteria program coordinator, grasps a bottle full of algae-choked water extracted from Upper Brooks Lake on the Shoshone National Forest. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) “It’s been a major priority for us,” Patterson said of cyanobacteria monitoring. “In Wyoming, I think we now have a better idea of where [blooms] are, and which ones are producing toxins. But we do have to make choices in how we’re allocating resources.” Many smaller backcountry Wyoming lakes prone to harmful cyanobacteria blooms will likely never be sampled every summer — or perhaps even ever. But others, like those in the chain of lakes where Hurshman hiked north of Togwotee Pass, are likely to be monitored annually and even be subject to special studies. There, the intensive effort is a result of Brooks Lake’s impaired classification in the Wyoming DEQ’s 305B and 303D report , which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act. Brooks Lakes’ impairment is listed as “not fully supporting” its fishery and other aquatic life due to an abundance of nutrients and elevated pH. DEQ officials, in turn, are trying to understand what, if anything, they can do to improve the water quality. To that end, DEQ employees Tavis Eddy and Val Shao pumped up packrafts to float out and measure for temperature, pH and other parameters a half mile up the trail from Upper Brooks Lake at Rainbow Lake back on Sept. 20. The boat-borne data collection was part of a three-year-long intensive monitoring effort that’s not yet completed. Eventually, the data they gather could help explain the factors plaguing the Brooks Lake system. Val Shao, a water technician for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, paddles a packraft toward the center of Rainbow Lake to conduct tests with Tavis Eddy, an environmental scientist with DEQ’s water quality program. The DEQ has monitored Rainbow Lake and other portions of the Brooks Lake watershed for several years to help determine what’s been causing nutrient-driven algal blooms. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) But in the meantime, scientists like Steg hesitate to hazard a guess as to what exactly is going on. “The whole purpose of what we’re doing here is to determine the causes and sources [of nutrients],” he said. “Another year and hopefully we’ll have some real data and can come up with some real answers.” Some answers will come sooner, like whether Upper Brooks Lake and other reaches of the watershed are dangerous to people’s pets this fall. The cyanotoxin lab results are already in. Hurshman’s samples from Upper Brooks Lake did not exceed the toxin threshold, but the water she gathered at Rainbow Lake did.

(Jesse Costa/WBUR) Warm weather and sunlight are attracting more than just summer vacationers to ponds in Massachusetts. These conditions are also contributing to ""blooms"" of cyanobacteria that public health officials warn can be harmful to humans and pets. This week, harmful blooms were detected in nine Massachusetts ponds, prompting the state to issue an updated advisory. On July 26, the advisory was updated again to 11 ponds and one lake. Experts including from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control say climate change increases the occurrence of these harmful blooms in the U.S. Studies point to bodies of water used for recreation in the Northeast as among the areas at risk of these blooms. “Warmer water coupled with the sunlight in the summer is just a perfect breeding ground for them,” said Lucia Ross, chief marketing officer at BlueGreen Water Technologies, a company that works to reduce cyanobacteria. While algal blooms are not always toxic, experts warn that cyanobacteria blooms in particular are a cause for concern. They can release “cyanotoxins” that — when touched, ingested or inhaled — can cause stomach aches and other illnesses. Cyanobacteria are found naturally in all types of water , but blooms signal an unbalanced growth that usually happens when they feed off nutrients from fertilizer and human and animal waste runoff. Ross adds that cyanobacteria thrive in still water and, when exposed to sun, can double in size every five hours. “So that biomass will keep getting larger and larger,” she said. According to the CDC, climate change can “make blooms occur more often and be more severe.” Hot weather driven mainly by climate change has caused record-high temperatures across the globe. Last month was the hottest June ever recorded on Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In Massachusetts, the number of cyanobacteria blooms typically peaks between August and October, according to the state Department of Public Health. But state data shows the blooms appear earlier in the year: Between Jan. 1 and July 21, the department was aware of 16 harmful cyanobacteria advisories issued in 2023. In 2022, 23 advisories were issued over the same time period. Blooms often appear as extra cloudy water or greenish foam or scum floating on the surface. The CDC says it’s not possible to tell if a bloom is toxic just by looking at it. But the the Massachusetts Department of Public Health says it is best practice to assume all cyanobacteria blooms pose a health risk, so people should stay away if they see one, whether or not an advisory has been issued.

The update will return in 2024. If you're a fan of swimming in Cape Cod ponds, or your pet has been known to take a dip, it's a good idea to keep up-to-date with the latest cyanobacteria monitoring information. The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), along with volunteers, pond associations, towns and the state, is monitoring more than 100 freshwater ponds for concentrations of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and toxins produced by the bacteria. These toxins can affect the liver and nerves, and cause sickness in people and animals. When levels rise, association staff members alert towns. The towns then may post a prohibition on swimming and other activities in the pond until the algal population drops. What causes blue-green algae blooms? The blooms usually occur in the late summer, fueled by warm water or high levels of nutrients from fertilizers, runoff or wastewater seeping through the soil. But Cape ponds remain warm into the fall and algal blooms have occurred as late as December, according to officials. Here are the Cape Cod ponds under alert or watch for cyanobacteria: Falmouth/Mashpee Ashumet Pond on the border of Falmouth and Mashpee is under a public health advisory in both towns after a sample was taken on Nov. 6. The public is advised not to swim in the pond or drink the water. Keep pets away. If you come into contact with the water, rinse off immediately. Orleans Uncle Harvey's Pond in Orleans is a pond of concern after a sample was taken on Nov. 6. According to the APCC, the potential concern status means: ""At the time and place of sampling, results indicate either moderate risk for potential exposure to cyanobacterial toxins approaching but below state standards, or a likelihood for increasing cyanobacteria risk over the next days to weeks."" NOTE: If you notice pond water is scummy or discolored and may have a strong odor, the association advises the public to avoid contact with the water. If you see what might be a suspicious cyanobacteria bloom, notify your local health department and send a photo to cyano@apcc.org noting the location, date and time.

The plant-biomass-sugar route dominates the current glucose supply, while the direct conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose through photosynthesis is not well studied. Here, we show that the potential of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 for photosynthetic glucose production can be unlocked by preventing native glucokinase activity. Knocking out two glucokinase genes causes intracellular accumulation of glucose and promotes the formation of a spontaneous mutation in the genome, which eventually leads to glucose secretion. Without heterologous catalysis or transportation genes, glucokinase deficiency and spontaneous genomic mutation lead to a glucose secretion of 1.5 g/L, which is further increased to 5 g/L through metabolic and cultivation engineering. These findings underline the cyanobacterial metabolism plasticities and demonstrate their applications for supporting the direct photosynthetic production of glucose.

Reed, Sierra M. Brooks, … Hal S. Alper Introduction Glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide molecule in nature. The breakdown of glucose provides energy and carbon materials in cells throughout all domains of life, powering the cellular machinery by diverse glycolytic pathways, including the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, and the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway 1 , 2 . As monomers, glucose, and its derivatives are also involved in the synthesis of various macromolecules and cellular components 3 , 4 . Moreover, glucose also serves as an important feedstock in the biorefinery industry, supporting the cultivation of multiple microbial cell factories for green biomanufacturing of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals 5 , 6 , 7 . In nature, glucose is mainly synthesized through the photosynthesis of plants and algae and exists as monomers of polysaccharides in plant/algae biomass, e.g., cellulose and starch. The plant-biomass-sugar route dominates the current massive glucose supply, whose economic feasibility is influenced by multiple parameters, such as plant-cultivation cycles, biomass-collection radius, and pre-treatment costs 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Against the backdrop of the global climate crisis and worsening food shortages, developing more efficient, continual, and industrial glucose production routes would be valuable 12 , 13 . In recent years, direct conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose, glucose precursors, and glucose polymers has been achieved by chemical-biochemical, electrochemical-biological, and in vitro cascade enzymatic routes 14 , 15 , 16 . In contrast, continuous glucose production has not been successfully linked directly to photosynthesis. In photoautotrophs, e.g., higher plants and algae, glucose is synthesized as storage for carbon and energy and plays important regulatory roles. Glucose metabolism possesses complex interactions with photosystems, disturbs the synthesis and metabolism of pigments, and might even inhibit the photosynthetic activities 17 , 18 , 19 ; thus, free glucose is rarely synthesized or accumulated in excess in photosynthetic cellular metabolism. In cyanobacteria, a group of oxygenic prokaryotic microalgae, some progress has been made to facilitate the direct synthesis and secretion of natural or non-natural sugars through genetic manipulations 20 , 21 , 22 . However, the photosynthetic production of glucose has not yet been well-studied. The recombinant strains can only produce limited amounts of glucose accompanied by the production of other sugars, suggesting that more detailed mechanisms of glucose metabolism in photoautotrophs remain to be disclosed 23 , 24 . In this work, we aim to engineer a direct and stable conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose through cyanobacteria photosynthesis. In a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter PCC 7942 for short), we identify the native glucokinase activity as the bottleneck restricting the metabolism potential for glucose synthesis. Targeted knockout of two glucokinase genes disturbs the carbohydrate metabolism and activates a metabolic flux towards glucose through the sucrose metabolism network, which is generally considered as a specialized response to osmotic stress. The enhanced glucose synthesis promotes the enrichment of a specific spontaneous genomic mutation on the chromosome of PCC 7942, which facilitates efficient glucose secretion. By implementing multiple omics approaches combined with systematic genetic manipulations, we clarify the pathways and mutations leading to glucose synthesis and secretion and optimize the glucose synthesis performances of the recombinant strains. Through subsequent metabolic engineering and cultivation optimization, the glucose secreted by the engineered strain surpasses 5 g/L during long-term cultivation, accounting for up to 70% of the fixed carbon source. Results Blocking glucose consumption by knocking out the glucokinases There are usually three steps to achieve efficient microbial production of the target metabolites: to construct pathways for the synthesis of the products 25 , 26 , to eliminate reactions that consume such products 27 , 28 , and to facilitate the mechanisms for product secretion 20 , 23 . Previous studies have shown that PCC 7942 can uptake extracellular glucose for biomass production by using heterologous glucose transporters, demonstrating their natural capacities for intracellular glucose consumption 29 . Two glucokinase genes ( Synpcc7942_0221 , glk1 ; Synpcc7942_2111 , glk2 ) that phosphorylate glucose to initiate the EMP or OPP pathway have been annotated on the PCC 7942 genome, so they were selected as knockout targets to block intracellular glucose re-assimilation. The manipulations were performed in parallel using a wild-type PCC 7942 (WT) and a recombinant strain carrying an E. coli sourced glucose transporter GalP (SZ14, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ). Previously, GalP has proven to be effective for facilitating glucose absorption in PCC 7942 29 , 30 , and here we use it to evaluate the impacts of glucokinase deficiency on the glucose consumption capacities of PCC 7942. Due to the polyploidy characteristics of cyanobacteria, passages with antibiotics-selection were necessary to isolate the desired homozygotes. Recombinant strains carrying an inactivated glucokinase gene ( glk1 or glk2 ) were easily obtained, but homozygote with simultaneously inactivated glk1 and glk2 in WT was difficult to isolate. Among several independent attempts, only one process resulted in a homozygote strain (SZ3) with a tailored genotype (completely blocked glk1 and glk2 ) after six weeks of continuous passages, while all the others failed (meaning that the wild-type copy of glk1 or glk2 could not be removed). The results indicated that glucokinase might have essential physiological functions, and potential secondary genomic mutations might be necessary for cellular acclimation to the deficiency. In the SZ14 strain carrying the GalP transporter, the homozygote mutant (SZ17) with simultaneously blocked glk1 and glk2 was more easily isolated, which indicates that the GalP activity might buffer the disturbance caused by the glucokinase deficiency. Enzymatic assays revealed that both genes ( glk1 and glk2 ) contributed to the glucokinase activity in PCC 7942, and their simultaneous knockout reduced glucokinase activity by about 70% in SZ3; as for the SZ14 strain with GalP transporter, glucokinase activity was even more significantly reduced by knocking out the two genes (in SZ17) to a lower level than that of SZ3 (Fig. 1a ). The residual glucokinase activities could be attributed to other non-specific kinases (e.g., fructokinase and phosphofructokinase). The higher glucokinase activity residual in SZ3 than that in SZ17 indicated that the wild-type background seemed essential to maintain a certain degree of glucokinase activity, so the recombinant strain underwent long-term domestication to adapt to the loss of the activities by uncertain mechanisms.

Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test (* p < 0.05, *** p < 0.001). The p values in ( c ) are (from left to right) 0.013, 0.0003. Data are presented as mean values ± SD ( n = 3 biological replicates). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image The mixotrophic cultivation results confirmed that intracellular glucose consumption was prevented in PCC 7942 as per the design. Supplementation of glucose (30 mM) improved the biomass production of the SZ14 strain (carrying the GalP transporter) by three folds, whereas no growth improvement was detected in the glucokinase-deficient strain, which indicated a loss in glucose utilization capacity (Fig. 1b ). In addition, the supplementation of glucose led to the recovery of glucokinase activity in the deficient strains (Fig. 1c ), indicating an adaptive response of the PCC 7942 metabolism toward exogenous glucose including stimulation of non-specific glucokinase activities. Glucokinase deficiency resulted in glucose secretion The enzymatic assay results indicated that glucokinase activities might be essential for PCC 7942 cells to maintain metabolism homeostasis, while the dependence could be partially relieved by introducing the glucose transporter GalP. Given the effects of GalP on native glucokinase dependence, we hypothesized that the glucokinase deficiency in PCC 7942 would lead to an abnormal accumulation of specific metabolites, that could be exported by GalP to relieve the potential toxicity or feedback stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the secreted metabolite profiles of the glucokinase-deficient strains (Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and found that significant amounts of glucose were accumulated in the culture medium. Under the adopted cultivation conditions (BG11 medium, 100 μmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply), 1.0 g/L and 0.33 g/L glucose were synthesized by SZ3 (WT- ∆glk1-∆glk2 ) and SZ17 (WT -∆glk1-∆glk2-∆NS3 :: galP ) strain respectively (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the accumulation of glucose occurred in the same pace as the cellular biomass production, which indicates that the extracellular glucose was synthesized and secreted by the living cells rather than from the contents of lysed cells. When carbon supply and illumination were further enhanced (3% CO 2 v/v in air, 200 μmol photons/m 2 /s), the glucose production of SZ3 and SZ17 increased to 1.64 g/L and 1.16 g/L, respectively; and the rates of the two strains for biomass accumulations were also improved. During the process, intracellular glucose concentrations in the glucokinase deficiency strains also increased (Supplementary Fig. 3b ). As for SZ3, about 5.6 mg/L/OD 730 glucose (over 70-fold higher than that of the control) was accumulated inside the cells on Day 6, and for SZ17, the intracellular glucose concentration reached up to 2.8 mg/L/OD 730 . Fig. 2: Cell growth and glucose secretions of the glucokinase-deficient strains. Cell densities ( a ) and extracellular glucose concentratons ( b ) of the the glucokinasedeficient strains SZ3 and SZ17 were measured and compared. SZ3 and SZ17 were cultivated under two conditions with different illumination strengths and carbon supply. Empty symbols and dotted lines represent the profiles from cultivation conditions of 30 °C, 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s and air-aerated; and solid symbols and solid lines represent profiles from the cultivation conditions of 30 °C, 200 µmol photons/m 2 /s and 3% CO 2 -aerated. Data are presented as mean values ± SD ( n = 3 biological replicates). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image To exclude the potential contributions of organic carbon source in the BG11 medium to glucose synthesis, we removed the citrate and ferric amine citrate components from the medium, but found no negative effect on glucose production, although cell growth of the recombinant strains was slightly diminished (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c ). We also performed isotope labeling cultivation to evaluate the contributions from organic carbon sources. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4d–i , when the recombinant Synechococcus cells were cultivated with 13 C labeled NaHCO 3 , the synthesized glucose could be rapidly labeled by 13 C, and the addition or removal of citrate and ferric amine citrate caused minor impacts on the labeling rates. Thus, we could propose that the glucose secreted by recombinant strains was dominantly from the conversion of inorganic carbon dioxide. Compared with previous reports, photosynthetic production of glucose by cyanobacteria was improved in this work. Over tenfold higher glucose productivity (0.27 g/L/OD 730 versus 0.027 g/L/OD 730 ) was achieved without the introduction or overexpression of any catalytic enzymes in Synechococcus . Moreover, the glucose synthesis of recombinant PCC 7942 continued during the rapid growth phase independent of any environmental stress inductions (e.g., salts stress or dark treatment) 23 , 24 . In addition, the SZ3 strain secreted most of the glucose (>95%, approximately 0.27 g/L/OD 730 versus 5.6 mg/L/OD 730 ) independently of heterologous transporters, suggesting that unknown glucose transportation mechanisms were activated by the glucokinase deficiency. Glucose synthesis is dominated by the sucrose metabolism pathway Glucose is generally not recognized as a main intracellular metabolite in PCC 7942, so we did not expect that blocking the glucose consumption capacity would shift a large portion of the carbon flux toward glucose synthesis. Theoretically, glucose can be generated through dephosphorylation of glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by glucose-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.10) or glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9). Although these genes have not been identified in PCC 7942, other phosphatases (alkaline phosphatase, Synpcc7942_139 2; inorganic diphosphatase, Synpcc7942_1383 ; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase II/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, Synpcc7942_0505 ; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Synpcc7942_2335 ; myo-inositol-monophosphatase, Synpcc7942_2582 ) might catalyze the reactions using glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate as non-specific substrates. Considering the amount of accumulated glucose, a more possible route was the sucrose hydrolyzation pathway, through which UDP-glucose and fructose-6-phosphate would be converted into sucrose catalyzed by sucrose-6-phosphate synthase ( sps , Synpcc7942_0808 ), and the generated sucrose could be hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose ( invA , Synpcc7942_0397 ) (Fig. 3a ). To confirm this hypothesis, we knocked out the two genes (SZ130, SZ3- ΔinvA ; SZ131, SZ3- Δ sps ; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 ), and found that the growth rate was not affected while glucose secretion was reduced by about 90% to 0.2 g/L (Fig. 3b, c ). The same phenomenon was observed for the SZ17 strain (Fig. 3d ).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image The results indicated that the sucrose synthesis pathway dominated the glucose accumulation in the glucokinase-deficient strains, which was counterintuitive because sucrose synthesis is usually recognized as an inducible physiological protective mechanism to resist hypersaline stress 31 . To investigate if a significant metabolic flux was maintained through the sucrose synthesis pathway in the glucokinase-deficient strains independent of hypersaline stress induction, we constructed an SZ130 derived strain, namely SZ153, carrying a heterologous sucrose transporter sucrose-proton permease (CscB) (Supplementary Figs. 7a, b ), in which the invA deficiency would block the potential sucrose hydrolysation, and the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induced cscB expression could facilitate the secretion of accumulated sucrose (Fig. 4a ). As shown in Fig. 4b , under standard conditions, there was no significant difference between the extracellular glucose produced by the two strains, whereas sucrose was secreted continuously only in SZ153 (to 350 mg/L in 8 d) with IPTG induced cscB expression. By expressing the CscB, the intracellular concentration of sucrose in SZ153 was also decreased from 10 mg/L/OD 730 to about 2 mg/L/OD 730 , while the intracellular glucose concentration was not influenced (Supplementary Figs. 7c, d ). Thus, it could be confirmed that a sucrose synthesis flux was maintained in PCC 7942 cells regardless of hypersaline stress.

The sucrose secretion through CscB under non-hypersaline conditions was also observed for the wild-type background. In the previously constructed strain FL92 (WT- ΔNS3 :: P lac -cscB ) 32 , IPTG-induced cscB expression improved extracellular sucrose secretion. The knockout of invA (named SZ21, Supplementary Fig. 8 ) improved sucrose secretion from 16 to 80 mg/L when no IPTG was added ( cscB expressed under a “leaky” state). When 0.1 mM IPTG was added, sucrose secretion by all three strains further increased to over 190 mg/L, and less glucose secretion was observed in the SZ21 and FL92 strains with functional glucokinases (Fig. 4c ). Based on the above results, we assumed that an active sucrose metabolism cycle existed in PCC 7942 and that the deficiency of glucokinase blocked glucose reutilization and further promoted the subsequent accumulation and secretion. In the sucrose metabolism deficient strains, a certain amount of glucose was still synthesized, indicating that there were additional pathways contributing to the glucose synthesis (e.g., potential non-specific dephosphorylation activity) in PCC 7942. A specific SNP facilitated efficient glucose secretion The glucokinase deficiency resulted in intracellular accumulation of glucose, whereas the mechanisms facilitating subsequent secretion independent of heterologous transporters remained to be disclosed. In the glucokinase deficient strain SZ17, the generated glucose could be exported out of the cells through the heterologous glucose transporter GalP, avoiding over-accumulation of intracellular glucose. In comparison, regarding the SZ3 strain, genomic mutations would be required to facilitate glucose secretion, which could also be an explanation for the long-term passages required for the isolation of the homozygotes. To this end, whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify the functional mutations facilitating glucose secretion in SZ3. Based on published genome information of PCC 7942 (FACHB-805), types of mutations were characterized on the genome of SZ3 and SZ17 (Supplementary Table 1 ), most of which were generated during the preservation and passages of the PCC 7942 strain in our laboratory and were previously identified through genome sequencing assays. Through the comparisons between SZ3 and SZ17, a specific SNP (G274A) was identified on the synpcc7942_1161 gene of the SZ3 genome, on which the 92 nd valine was converted into isoleucine (Fig. 5a ). The knockout of synpcc7942_1161 (G274A) in the SZ3 strain (SZ141, Supplementary Fig. 9 ) reduced the glucose secretion by 78% to 0.33 g/L, thereby demonstrating the essential role of this gene (Fig. 5b ).

Data are presented as mean values ± SD. All sample size n (biological replicates) in ( b , d and f ) is 3. All sample size n (biological replicates) in ( c ) is 6. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Synpcc7942_1161 was annotated to encode a divalent metal transporter with five transmembrane domains (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that the G274A mutation might improve the affinities of glucose to the Synpcc7942_1161 inner membrane exporter, thereby facilitating more efficient glucose secretion in the SZ3 strain. However, a subsequent transcriptome assay suggested more complex effects of the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation. And among the transcripts with significantly elevated abundances in the SZ3 strain, the synpcc7942_1161 transcript was the most significantly up-regulated, reaching up to a 77-fold increase. In addition, four other genes located in the same operon with synpcc7942_1161 were also significantly up-regulated ( synpcc7942_1160 by 37 folds, synpcc7942_1162 by 59 folds, synpcc7942_1163 by 37 folds, and synpcc7942_RS13740 by 34 folds), constituting the top five up-regulated transcripts in SZ3. To explore if the elevated transcriptions were caused by the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation, we introduced this mutation into the PCC 7942 WT genome (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and examined the transcriptome changes. The results revealed that the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation significantly increased the transcript abundance of three gene-encoding potential transporter proteins (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Data 1 ), which suggested that the enhanced expressions of the operon were likely caused by this mutation. Synpcc7942_1161 abundance seemed to determine the glucose secretion phenotypes because the overexpression of the wild-type gene in the SZ17 strain (SZ192, Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 12 ) increased the glucose production to the level of SZ3. We further replaced the GalP on the chromosome of SZ17 with wild-type synpcc7942_1161 and a mutated version synpcc7942_1161- G274A, obtaining JS155, and JS156, respectively (Fig. 5e ). As shown in Fig. 5f , JS155 and JS156 secreted comparable amounts of glucose into the culture broth, both of which were higher than SZ17. And the intracellular glucose concentrations in the two strains were also slightly improved. Thus, it can also be proposed that the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation promoted glucose secretion (in SZ3) mainly by elevating transcript abundances of the synpcc7942_1161 rather than optimizing the specific activities of the respective transporter. Besides, we further evaluated and compared the stability of synpcc7942_1161 mRNA in JS155 and JS156 under the control of the Plac promoter, and no difference was found between the two versions of synpcc7942_1161 mRNA with or without the G274A mutation (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Thus, it could be speculated that the elevated abundances of synpcc7942_1161 transcripts were due to the increased transcription activities rather than the optimization of transcript stability. We also assumed that the mutated synpcc7942_1161 might contribute to a unidirectional transport function of intracellular glucose because the PCC 7942 WT strain carrying the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation could not absorb glucose (Supplementary Fig. 14 ). Based on the above results, we assumed a model for the generation of the glucokinase-deficient strain SZ3. As shown in Fig. 6 , the glucokinase deficiency blocked the glucose-6-phosphate ↔ glucose cycle, and it enriched the spontaneous mutation of synpcc7942_1161 -G274A. The synpcc7942_1161 -G274A might promote glucose secretion by increasing the abundance or activity of the Synpcc7942_1161 inner membrane exporter, which initiated the glucose secretions more efficiently. Finally, the elevated glucose secretions buffered the potential feedback stress and enabled the isolation of the final homozygote of SZ3.

Full size image Engineering for enhanced and prolonged glucose production The global RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that transcriptome was remodeled in SZ3, and expressions of 581 genes were significantly regulated (227 up-regulated and 354 down-regulated, Supplementary Data 2 ) compared with WT. Enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways involved in photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly regulated ( p value < 0.01) in SZ3 (Supplementary Fig. 15 ), and that was consistency with the weakened photosynthesis activities (oxygen evolution rates; Supplementary Fig. 16 ) in SZ3 compared with WT. Meanwhile, many genes participating in nitrogen metabolism and amino acids metabolism in SZ3 also show changed transcription levels, which were associated with the active “carbon spilling” status in the glucokinase deficiency strain, especially for those tightly associated with nitrogen metabolism. To further elucidate the effects of glucokinase deficiency metabolism, untargeted metabolomics assays were performed between SZ3 and the wild-type. Through LC-MS/MS assays, 116 differentiated metabolites were identified (Supplementary Data 3 , 4 ). Consistent with the transcriptome change, several amino acids concentration inside SZ3 were changed. For example, concentrations of arginine, glutamate, and glutamine, which are involved in the ornithine-ammonia cycle 33 , were all reduced by over 50% (Fig. 7 ). Another representative metabolomics characteristic of the glucokinase-deficient strain SZ3 was the increased abundance of sugar compounds and decreased content of phosphorylated metabolites (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). This phenomenon indicated that glucokinases might function as non-specific phosphorylases with broader substrates in the PCC 7942 metabolism, which could also explain the difficulty to isolate the glucokinase-deficient homozygotes. To confirm this hypothesis, we purified Glk1 and Glk2 of PCC 7942 and evaluated the activities of the two enzymes on phosphorylating sugars other than glucose. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 17 , both the two glucokinases showed phosphorylation activities on some other sugars besides glucose. The unspecific activities of Glk2 toward the eight sugars all exceed 20% (of the specific activity for glucose), reaching up to 50% for fructose, mannose, and galactose. The in vitro assay results provided further evidence for the hypothesis that glucokinases may play an important role in phosphorylating and recycling sugars in PCC 7942. In addition, several phosphorylated metabolites with decreased concentrations (ribulose-5-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate) are involved in the CBB cycle (Fig. 7 ), for which the decreased abundances could also be a result of the carbon flow deprivation caused by the glucose synthesis & secretion.

Full size image Regarding the sucrose-metabolism pathway directly supporting the glucose synthesis, the abundance of the important intermediate metabolites was differently regulated, indicating an unbalanced catalytic route (Fig. 7 ). Compared to the wild-type control, the intracellular sucrose concentration decreased by 74.3%, whereas that of fructose increased by eightfold. These results indicate a strong driving force for glucose secretion and enhanced fructose output, which exceeded the conversion capacity of native fructokinase. The concentrations of most upstream metabolites generally decreased (by 88.3% for glucose-1-phosphate, 88.4% for glucose-6-phosphate, 69.9% for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and 97.7% for fructose-6-phosphate), except for UDP-glucose (2.93-fold increase). The functional enzymes responsible for the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucose have not been identified in PCC 7942 34 . Therefore, the mechanisms causing the UDP-glucose over-accumulation should be further investigated in future studies. To further improve the glucose photosynthetic production, several essential enzymes of the sucrose metabolism pathways were individually overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 8 , the bifunctional sucrose-6-phosphate synthase/sucrose-6-phosphotase (catalyzing the synthesis of sucrose-6-phosphate and sucrose from fructose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose), the invertase (catalyzing the degradation of sucrose into fructose and glucose), the phosphoglucose isomerase (catalyzing the conversion between fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate), the phosphoglucose mutase (catalyzing the conversion between glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate), the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (catalyzing the conversion from fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) were all individually overexpressed in the SZ3 strain. Most recombinant strains performed enhanced glucose production, improving extracellular glucose concentrations from approximately 1.6 to 2 g/L during a 16-18 days cultivation process. The only exception was the overexpression of fructokinase, for which glucose secretion was decreased. A possible explanation is that the increased fructokinase enzymes catalyzed glucose as a non-specific substrate and restored the previously blocked glucose/phosphoglucose cycle (Supplementary Fig. 18 ), leading to the reduction of the glucose synthesis branch.

The p values are (from left to right) 0.0029, 0.0026, 0.0011, 0.0049, <0.0001, 0.0017, <0.0001. Data are presented as mean values ± SD. All sample size n (biological replicates) is 3. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image As mentioned above, the optimization of carbon supply and illumination strengths improved the glucose production of SZ3 and SZ17 strains, as well as the biomass accumulation rates. We used the SZ123 strain to improve glucose production by cultivation optimization, and the results showed improved biomass and glucose production (from 2 to 2.9 g/L; Fig. 9a ; Supplementary Fig. 19 ) using concentrated (2×) BG11 culture medium 35 . For prolonged glucose synthesis, we adopted a fed-batch strategy by re-suspending the glucose-synthesizing cells (meaning harvesting the cells and suspending the cells with fresh medium) for every 12 d. This strategy effectively prolonged the glucose-synthesizing activities of the SZ123 cells (Fig. 9b ) and led to the accumulation of 5 g/L glucose after 3 batches, which took up over 70% of the carbon flux fixed by the recombinant Synechococcus cells (Supplementary Fig. 20 ). The glucose accumulation rates gradually decreased with the decline in cell density. Therefore, the cellular robustness of the recombinant cell factories to maintain stable growth and metabolism in long-term cultivation is the main factor for the control of glucose production. Accordingly, future systematic solutions to strain and cultivation engineering should further improve these aspects.

Full size image Discussion In this work, we unlocked the potential of cyanobacterial photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide directly into glucose. Photosynthesis is the most extensive biochemical process on Earth, and photoautotrophs convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into primary organic carbon to support the maintenance of the biosphere 36 . Currently, the refining of sugar-rich plant/algal biomass serves as the dominating route to produce sugar in large quantities, meeting the needs of the food and medicine areas as well as the biorefinery industry 8 , 9 . The “one-pot, one-step” mode of cyanobacterial photosynthetic production could serve as a more continual, stable, and efficient sugar alternative than the “plants-biomass-sugar” route 37 . Most cyanobacteria species can naturally synthesize and accumulate sugar-type compatible solutes to resist abiotic environmental stress 38 . The accumulation and secretion of these compatible sugar compounds (such as sucrose and trehalose) by cyanobacteria can be optimized through genetic manipulation 20 , 21 , and biotechnology application scenarios such as the development of artificial consortia are explored and expanded 39 , 40 . However, glucose, the most representative and important monosaccharide molecule, cannot be efficiently synthesized and accumulated in cyanobacteria. Recently, glucose secretion (accompanied by sucrose secretion) has been observed in a PCC 7942 mutant with deleted xpk gene (which encodes phosphoketolase). However, this glucose synthesis can only be triggered in the dark with salts stress conditions, and the titer is rather limited, reaching approximately 3 mM by high-density cells (the initial OD 730 is 20, and the final average productivity of 0.027 g/L/OD 730 ) 24 . In another, earlier reported work, the titer of salt-induced glucose synthesis (accompanied by fructose secretion) reached only 30 μM (productivity of 0.027 g/L/OD 750 ) in PCC 7942 by overexpressing sucrose hydrolase and hexose transporters 23 . In contrast, continuous synthesis of glucose during the rapid photoautotrophic growth phase was achieved in this work, with productivity higher than 0.27 g/L/OD 730 , by simply removing the glucokinase activities in Synechococcus cells, meaning tenfold higher photosynthetic productivities in the absence of any heterologous catalytic enzymes or transporters and independent of any environmental stress inductions. Although a majority of the isolated cyanobacteria species perform autotrophic metabolism and are deficient to absorb and utilize exogenous glucose as the carbon source, some cyanobacteria strains are capable of using glucose 41 , 42 . As for the cyanobacteria strains able to perform heterotrophic or mixotrophic metabolism using glucose, glucokinase plays an essential role in phosphorylating glucose and initiating the diverse glycolytic processes 43 , 44 . However, glucokinase genes are ubiquitous in the vast majority of the sequenced cyanobacterial genomes (Supplementary Data 5 ). For example, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which has been shown to lack the capacity to absorb and utilize exogenous glucose, has two glucokinase genes on its genome, implying that glucokinase has more physiological functions than glucose utilization. Through systematic genetic modifications, we identified an active and stable glucose-phosphoglucose cycle in PCC 7942, which was maintained in the sucrose metabolism pathway. Previously, sucrose synthesis and accumulation were generally recognized as a salt-stress responsive mechanism to resist hyperosmotic stress 31 , 45 . In contrast, we demonstrated in this work that the synthesis-degradation cycle of sucrose in PCC 7942 remains active independent of salts stress induction, and the glucokinase activity performs as a “floodgate” to avoid the overaccumulation of glucose, which is an intermediate in the sucrose metabolism network and has a potential impact on the photosynthetic metabolism. Besides sucrose metabolism, some other non-specific reactions may also contribute to the synthesis and accumulation of glucose in PCC 7942. Thus, it could be assumed that intracellular glucose synthesis may be continuously maintained in PCC 7942, whereas glucokinase was crucial to recycle glucose into the central metabolism network by a phosphorylation process, and this mechanism can potentially rescue the potential energy loss and metabolism disturbance caused by glucose secretion and accumulation. In addition, although cell growths and photosynthesis were not inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 16 ), glucokinase--deficient strains showed improved sensitivity to 150 mM NaCl (Supplementary Fig. 21 ), indicating that the stable glucose-phosphoglucose cycle contributes to the rapid response of PCC 7942 toward salt stress. Previously it has been proven that the ionic effect is important for inducing sucrose accumulation in PCC 7942, whereby an elevated ion concentration directly activates the sucrose-synthesizing enzyme Sps and simultaneously inhibits the sucrose-degrading enzyme Inv 31 . The maintenance of the sucrose metabolism cycle permitted the direct activity-regulation of ion concentrations on the enzymes, and the glucokinase activities could guarantee the rapid re-utilization of sugars (fructose and glucose) from hydrolyzed sucrose (activity of Inv would be reduced rather than completely removed by elevated ion concentrations). An important issue in microbial metabolic engineering is the adaptation of chassis cells to artificial pathways and genomic modifications. The in-plugged and rewired metabolic activities can disturb carbon distribution, co-factor supply, and redox balances of the native cellular metabolism, and are prone to stimulate the responses of the host cells on levels of physiology, metabolism, and even genetics 46 , which should be relieved through metabolic designs and engineering. Transporter engineering has become a universal strategy to increase the adaptability of microbial chassis cells to heterologous pathways, which could promote product secretion, relieve the metabolic burden of intracellular over-accumulation and reduce the potential inhibitory effect of the products 47 . An alternative solution was suggested in this study. To achieve effective glucose transport, we introduced a heterologous transporter GalP on the chromosome of PCC 7942, which reduced the potential intracellular metabolic or physiological stress and facilitated the convenient and smooth acquisition of the genetic transformants (SZ17). In comparison, without introducing heterologous transporters, a spontaneous mutation ( Synpcc7942_1161 -G274A) was generated and enriched during the long-term cultivation process and endowed the mutant strain with even better capacities for glucose synthesis and secretion. Combining artificial genetic modifications with metabolic stress-induced spontaneous genomic mutations might rewire the metabolic flow more effectively. In summary, we identified the key factors restricting the natural potential of cyanobacteria for the photosynthetic production of glucose. Without heterologous catalysis or transportation genes, a large portion of photosynthetically fixed carbon dioxide in the engineered strain with deficient glucokinase activities and a spontaneous genome mutation was rewired into the secretory production of glucose. The discoveries shed light on developing and industrializing more directional and continuous glucose production systems with solar energy and carbon dioxide. Methods Plasmid construction All endogenous genes were PCR amplified from the wild-type PCC 7942 genome using gene-specific primers and high-fidelity DNA polymerase (TransGen, Beijing, China). All primers used in this study and the constructed plasmids are listed in Supplementary Data 6 . The E. coli strain DH5α was used to construct the plasmids, and all strains were grown at 37 °C in the Luria-Bertani medium (liquid or agar petri dish) supplemented with corresponding antibiotics (Solarbio). Ampicillin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, gentamycin, and chloramphenicol were used at 100, 50, 50, 40, and 50 µg/mL, respectively, for strains with corresponding resistance genes. All backbone vectors were defined based on pUC19 or pBR322 by inserting homologous regions, promoters, and antibiotic resistance cassettes with restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation or seamless cloning. The homologous-recombination regions in all plasmids were located at approximately 1000 bp upstream sequence and 1000 bp downstream sequence of the integrated gene locus. Eco RI, Xba I, Eco RV, Nae I, Eag I, and Bam HI were the restriction cloning sites used to construct pSS1 and pSS2. All restriction enzymes were fast digestion enzymes from Thermo Fisher Science (Shanghai, China). The plasmids were constructed using the seamless cloning method and the Seamless Assembly Cloning Kit (Taihe Biology Co., LTD, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. E. coli colonies with positive plasmids were confirmed by colony PCR using gene-specific primers and Taq DNA polymerase (TransGen Biotech). Plasmids purified with a Mini-prep kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek) were checked by Sanger sequencing before the PCC 7942 transformation. Construction and cultivation of PCC 7942 derived strains The genetic modifications of the PCC 7942 genome were performed using a double homologous recombination system to integrate the genes into the target sites. All plasmids were transformed into PCC 7942 through the natural transformation. Transformants grown on antibiotic selective plates were analyzed by PCR and second-generation DNA sequencing of the amplified fragments 32 . The PCC 7942 derived strains constructed in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 7 . PCC 7942 derived strains were inoculated into liquid BG11 medium containing corresponding antibiotics and cultivated for 4–6 d under rotary shaking (150 rpm) and white-light illumination of 50 µmol photons/m 2 /s at 30 °C. Subsequently, the culture broth was inoculated into 200 mL of BG11 medium in 250 mL flasks under continuous white light of 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s and bubbled with air. Kanamycin, spectinomycin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were added into the medium for final concentrations of 20, 20, 2, and 10 µg/mL, respectively. Finally, the culture broth from the flasks was centrifuged and resuspended with 65 mL fresh BG11 culture medium to the initial OD 730 of approximately 2.0 in column photobioreactors (with a diameter of 3 cm). Except when specifically noted, the cultivations for photosynthetic glucose production were performed at 30 °C. During the long-term cultivation experiment, antibiotics were eliminated, 8 mM TES-NaOH (pH = 8) was added to maintain the pH of the culture, and the genotypes of the cells were checked by PCR at the end of the cultivation. During the cultivation process, 0.5 mL of culture broth was sampled from each column photobioreactor every other day to measure the OD 730 and glucose concentrations, and sterile water was supplemented to maintain the original volume. For special experiments, the organic carbon contents (citric acid and ferric ammonium citrate) would be removed from the BG11 medium. Glucose production To determine the extracellular glucose contents secreted by the PCC 7942 derived strains, the culture broth was sampled and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Then the glucose concentrations in the supernatant were calculated using the D-glucose assay kit (Megazyme) or ICS5000+ (DIONEX, Thermo Scientific, USA) ion-exchange chromatography system equipped with an electrochemical detector and a Dionex CarboPac MA1 analytical column (4×250 mm, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Intracellular glucose was extracted from cellular pellets following a previous study 48 . In brief, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL 80% ethanol (volume to volume) and then incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried under a stream of N 2 at 55 °C. Subsequently, the dry residues were dissolved in ultrapure water, and the dissolved solution was filtered into clean vials with a 0.22 μm filtration membrane. Glucose contents in the filtrate were also calculated using the D-glucose assay kit (Megazyme) or ion chromatography. Glucokinase activity Glucokinase activity was measured by a modified enzyme-linked assay 3 . Synechococcus cells cultivated in BG11 medium were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 mL of breakage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) pre-cooled to 4 °C. Quartz sand (Sigma) was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were disrupted by vortex mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, 60 µL of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate, to which 200 µL of a reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM NADP + , 10 mM glucose, and 5 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured every 5 min in the dark. The slope of A 510 , which increased with time, was calculated, and the specific enzyme activity of glucokinase in the reaction mixture was calculated according to the Lambert-Beer law. The 13 C labeling cultivation The 13 C labeling experiments were performed using 13 C labeled sodium bicarbonate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99% 13 C, CLM-441), and 12 C-NaHCO 3 was added as a control. First, cells at the exponential growth phase were adjusted to an OD 730 of 0.6 in 10 mL BG11 including 50 mM NaHCO 3 and appropriate antibiotics, and then cultivated in 30 mL sealed flasks (with no headspace) with or without citric acid and ammonium ferric citrate under continuous light conditions. For assays of the intracellular metabolites, cells were collected by centrifugation every 24 h, extracted rapidly with 2 mL of 80:20 methanol/water (vol/vol), and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Intracellular metabolites were extracted via the freeze/thaw cycle five times. After centrifugation and nitrogen blowing, 100 µL ddH 2 O was added to the sample for resuspension and was taken for derivatization reaction. The sample derivatization was carried out in two steps: (1) adding 40 µL methoxyamine solution (25 mg/mL, dissolved in pyridine solvent) and then incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. (2) 40 µL TMS reagent (BSTFA/TMCS, 99:1) was added to each sample and then reacted at 37 °C for 120 min. For assays of the extracellular glucose, 100 µL supernatant of SZ3 culture broth was taken for freeze-drying and derivatization respectively. After centrifugation, GC-MS was performed to analyze the samples. GC-MS assays were carried out by Agilent 7890, equipped with Agilent 5977 mass detector and HP-INNOWax column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). Ultra-pure helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 3 mL/min. The temperature of the column box was initially kept at 60 °C for 5 min, increased to 260 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min, and then kept at 260 °C for 10 min. Characteristic mass signals from glucose were detected at m/z 204(M + 0), 205(M + 1), 206(M + 2), and then were calculated based on the ratio of labeled metabolites to unlabeled, to analyze related intermediates and to detect the labeled ratio of glucose in cells per unit time. Genome sequencing For whole-genome re-sequencing of SZ3 and SZ17, genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for qualities and concentrations using the Nanodrop ND-1000 system (Thermo Scientific, US) and Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, US). Subsequently, quantified DNA samples were fragmented, blunted, modified with 3ʹ-A overhangs, ligated to Illumina’s standard sequencing adapters, and amplified by PCR. The library was sequenced as paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. Library constructions and sequencing were performed by Allwegene Tech (Beijing, China). The reference sequence ( Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, FACHB-805) was obtained from the GenBank for read mapping. BWA 49 was used to reference sequences, and SAMtools 50 was used to sort the results and mark duplicate reads. Subsequently, SNPs and structure variation (SV) between reference sequences and sample sequences were identified by SAMtools and BreakDancer 51 , respectively. Then, DNA fragments containing SNPs and SV were amplified from the genomic DNA and further verified by Sanger sequencing. Synpcc7942_1161 mRNA stability evaluation Synechococcus cells cultivated in flasks shaken under 50 μmol photons/m 2 /s white fluorescent light at 30 °C. Cells in the log phase were harvested and resuspended to an OD 730 of 4. Actinomycin D (ActD, 5 μg/mL) was added to block de novo mRNA synthesis and total RNA was isolated at indicated time points (0, 5, 25, and 45 min) after adding ActD using a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The RNA samples were then reverse transcribed into cDNA using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 Sequence Detector (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; LightCycler 480 software 1.5) based on SYBR Green I fluorescence (ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix-Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Untargeted metabolomics analysis Synechococcus cells cultured to the 8th day under standard cultivation conditions (30 °C, 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply) were centrifuged and washed three times with a phosphate buffered saline buffer (Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 15 min and then stored at −80 °C until the analysis. Afterward, 200 µL of ddH 2 O and 800 µL of an acetonitrile-methanol mixture (1:1) were added to 80 mg of cell pellets. After vortexing for 1 min, all samples were stored at −20 °C for 1 h for protein precipitation. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Subsequently, 100 µL of resuspension solution (0.1% formic acid in ddH 2 O) was added and vortexed for 30 s. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane. To ensure the quality of the metabolomics analysis, quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing six replicates in each group. For the untargeted metabolomics analysis, samples were injected into an Agilent 1290 Infinity Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm particle size) and detected with an AB Triple TOF 5600/6600 mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (AB SCIEX, Canada). The temperature of the column was maintained at 25 °C. The gradient mobile phase was a mixture of 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonia in water for mobile phase A, and acetonitrile for mobile phase B, at a flow rate of 0.30 mL/min. The proportion of mobile phase B was optimized as 0–0.5 min, 95% B; 0.5–7 min, 95%–65% B; 7.0–8.0 min, 65%–40% B; 8.0–9.0 min, 40% B; 9.0–9.1 min, 40%–95% B; 9.1–12 min, 95% B. A scan range from 50 to 1200 m/z (mass-charge ratio) was adopted for the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The ion spray voltage was set to +5 kV for the positive ionization mode (ESI + ) and -5 kV for the negative mode (ESI-). The collision energy was set to +15 and –15 eV for ESI+ and ESI-, respectively. The declustering potentials were set to +60 V (ESI+) and –60V (ESI–), and the source temperature was 650 °C. The raw LC-MS data was converted by the ProteoWizard software and introduced into an XCMS for peak identification, matching, and integration. Compound identification of metabolites by MS/MS spectra with an in-house database established with available authentic standards. The identified metabolites were further searched against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database for the metabolic pathway analysis. Subsequently, data were pre-processed by Pareto-scaling for the principal component analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The one-dimensional statistical analysis included the student’s t test and multiple variation analysis. Transcriptome profiling Synechococcus cells cultured to the 4th day under standard cultivation conditions (30 °C, 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply) were centrifuged and washed with DNase/RNase-free water (Supplementary Fig. 23 ). Cell pellets were collected and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 15 min. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA extraction from frozen cell pellets (three biological replicates in each group). The RNA quality and concentration were analyzed using the Nanodrop ND-1000 system (Thermo Scientific, USA) and Agilent 2100 RAN NANO 6000 Assay kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Paired-end libraries were prepared using the RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The enriched mRNA was fragmented by adding a fragmentation buffer, and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase, for which mRNA fragments were used as templates, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I, RNaseH, buffer, and dNTPs. The synthesized double-stranded cDNA fragments were then purified using a QIAQuick PCR kit. The purified double-stranded cDNA was poly-adenylated and adapter-ligated to prepare the paired-end library. The adaptor-ligated cDNA and adaptor primers were used for PCR amplification. Finally, the Illumina platform was applied to sequence the resulting cDNA libraries, and 150 bp paired-end reads were obtained. Clean reads were trimmed from raw reads, and all downstream analyses were based on the clean reads. By using the Bowtie 2 software, paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The number of reads corresponding to each gene was calculated using FeatureCounts 52 . Subsequently, every gene’s fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) were calculated based on the length of the gene and the reads count mapped to this gene. Genes with p -adj <0.05 and |log 2 foldchange | > log 2 (1.5) were defined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein expression and purification The Glk1 ( Synpcc7942_0221 ), Glk2 ( Synpcc7942_2111 ), and Fk ( Synpcc7942_0116 ) genes were amplified from the PCC 7942 genome and cloned into the pET28a, generating the recombinant expression plasmids pYW16, pJS89 and pJS90, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) for the overproduction of target proteins. The transformants were grown in 500 mL LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C. At an OD 600 of 0.6–0.8, cells were induced by 0.3 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 20 h. After induction, cells were then harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in prechilled lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatants were filtered through 0.22 μm polyethersulfone membranes and then loaded on a Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) for affinity purification. The typical bind-wash-elute procedure was then used to get the target proteins. Protein concentration in the fractions was determined by the Bradford method, and the purity of target proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE. Sugar phosphorylating activities assays The phosphorylating activities of glucokinase and fructokinase on different sugar substrates were measured by using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) enzyme-linked assay as previously described with modifications 53 . In brief, 20 µL of the purified protein was transferred to a 96-well plate, to which 210 µL of a reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.3 mM NADP + , 10 mM specific sugar, 1 mM PEP, 1.4 U/mL PK, 2.8 U/mL LDH) was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured every 15 s during 1 h in the dark. The slope of A 510 , which decreased with time, was calculated, and the specific enzyme activity of glucokinase/fructokinase on each sugar would be compared to the activities on glucose/fructose to get the relative ratios. Glucokinase genes distributions analysis To comprehensively investigate the genomic Glucokinase sequences of cyanobacteria, we downloaded all available cyanobacterial genomic sequences and their annotation from the NCBI assembly database using the NCBI-datasets tools. A total of 986 no-redundantly reference-level cyanobacteria genomes were used to construct the genome database. The genome database was screened using the hmmsearch tool of the Hmmer package (version 3.1b2) 54 , and potential Glucokinase sequences from 947 cyanobacterial genomes were retrieved to show significant matches with this Glucokinase HMM (PF02685) with E values < 1 –50 (Supplementary Data 5 ). Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates and respiration rates Synechococcus cells were harvested and resuspended with 17 mL fresh BG11 to the initial OD 730 of approximately 2.0. The respiration rates were measured under dark for 200 s at 30 °C and the whole chain photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates were measured for 160 s at each light level (RGB light source) with the YZQ-201A photosynthetic instrument (Yizongqi Technology Co., Ltd, China) in the presence of 10 mM NaHCO 3 . The total photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates were calculated as the net photosynthetic rate plus the respiration rate.

Recent heavy rains have led to phosphorus runoff and sewage leaks into Vermont lakes and ponds. Cyanobacteria blooms have closed beaches along Lake Champlain multiple times this summer, with warmer water temperatures due to climate change causing the blooms to occur more frequently. Even if the lake looks safe to the eye for a swim, it might not be. Vermont Edition host Mikaela Lefrak spoke with Jeffrey Schloss, the acting extension program leader with the Lake Champlain Sea Grant, an organization which develops and shares scientific knowledge to benefit the Lake Champlain basin. A portion of their conversation is below, and has been edited and condensed for clarity. Mikaela Lefrak: Now, Jeff, when you saw the flooding begin in that second week of July, I'm curious what your first thoughts were as somebody who has monitored water quality in this region for years? Jeffrey Schloss: We know that when we have floods of that magnitude, we tend to see a tremendous amount of movement of materials into Lake Champlain and all the other lakes around Vermont, because of the higher velocity of water and the capability to essentially carry more suspended materials... And so we know that events like that could actually represent close to 80 to 90% of the year's loading of nutrients, for example, coming into lakes that are receiving those waters. So when you when you saw this flooding happen ...  as you're thinking about what what was to come for Lake Champlain, that must have been a must have been a very difficult moment. Well, of course, the real concern was for the flooded communities, and the economic impacts, and the changes to habitat. So that was really my primary concern. But of course, secondarily, we're very interested in what the impacts will be on the lake water quality. We saw for a time after and even continuing now, we have new loads of sediment in the deltas where the rivers come into the lake, where the tributary rivers come in. We also saw from remote sensing, as well as satellite remote sensing as well as our own UVM drone sensing, we saw the tremendous amount of sediments that not only you could see in the in the in the rivers as they were coming into the lake, but you can see in the lake. So there was a tremendous amount of sediment load and of course attached to that sediment, all sorts of nutrients and potential pesticides and other types of pollutants that were delivered to the lake. I believe I saw some of that drone footage . And it's pretty remarkable how visual it is — that you can really see the sediment flowing right into the lake. Yeah, and some of our areas have a lot of very fine clays, which mean that that sediment will stay up in the water column for a very long time before it settles down, since it's such fine material. Some of the heavier materials that are moved essentially just fall right as they enter the lake and create those deltas because they're heavier and the velocity slows down when the river water enters the lake. But those clay particles will be there for a long time. Now, Jeff, I read that state officials said that over the course of a week in July, 130% of the entire phosphorus load from 2022 for the Lamoille River flowed into Lake Champlain. And there was also a lot of runoff coming from the Missisquoi River as well. Talk us through what that means. That sounds like an enormous increase. Yes, that is, and the fact that we still have some summer to go, it'll be interesting to see how the lake reacts. You know, the lake is essentially going to be the reaction vessel where all of that material has now come in. And any of the available nutrients will definitely be worked on by all the various organisms in the lake, and we will be really concerned to see whether or not that will result in in seeing bloom activity occur, depending upon how high the the water remains, as well as how calm we have in terms of the coming weather as we approach the fall. Elodie Reed / Vermont Public File A cyanobacteria bloom is pictured on Lake Champlain in St. Albans in August 2019. Well, let's talk about those blooms, the cyanobacteria blooms, specifically. Those close down beaches, they affect the ecosystem. What is cyanobacteria? What is a cyanobacteria bloom? Essentially, cyanobacteria are some of the most primitive bacteria, photosynthetic organisms we've had on Earth. In fact, most people attribute the oxygen in our atmosphere that was created to them, since they were the earliest sort of synthetic organisms. They're one of many types of bacteria that are photosynthetic that you can find in waters. They're found all over the place in the oceans and in our waters. Typically they don't become problematic until there's a combination of very warm water as well as a lot of excess nutrients which then drive them to outcompete all the other photosynthetic algae in the water. And, what we then will see is a bloom, sometimes we see blooms because there's just so much productivity occurring, because of the nutrients. Sometimes we see blooms because there are there are smaller amounts of the bacteria that are growing, but then the the wind will push them in, in towards shore into bays and embayments. And so they will collect. They tend to be distributed early on in the bottom waters and sometimes mid-lake depths. And towards the end of the season, we tend to see them come up into the upper area of the water column and collect. You'll definitely see them as greenish, or blue-greenish blooms that sometimes look like small little pin-size balls or, or sometimes looks like spilled paint. There are other types of algae that do bloom, but they tend to be look more stringer and, as opposed to more shinier, or flakier or more kind of bubbly. So they're generally very visual when you see them. And that's when we become most concerned about their accumulation, because they do produce a number of toxins on occasion. Those toxins are either neurotoxins or liver toxins, they also produce other irritants. And there's some people that will react to them by having rashes occur when they come in contact with them. So there are a lot concerned about those toxins, because there are some very acute situations where even if we have small children or small pets drinking water with a bloom with toxins in them, we could see tremendous problems. Dogs have been known to die from drinking lake water. And kids can get very sick. So we're very concerned about about when they accumulate and produce toxins. And again, there are these short term exposure concerns. But we also have some long-term concerns, because we see that long-term exposure has the possibility of causing certain neurological diseases and disorders. More from Vermont Public: ALS And Algae Blooms? Scientists Say A State Registry Is Needed To Study Possible Link OK. So there's the cyanobacteria blooms caused in part by the increase in phosphorus runoff. And then in mid-July, there was a sewer pipe that ran under the Winooski River that broke and at its height, it was spewing 350,000 gallons of wastewater into the Winooski, which feeds into Lake Champlain. That's about 10% of Burlington's total sewage flow. What kind of setback to clean up efforts does a break like that pose? Well, of course, you have the instantaneous concern from the other type of bacteria that we generally post warnings on beaches [about], the fecal coliform bacteria, which are indicators that if we have the presence of sewage coming into the water, especially if people are using it to recreate. There's a very high chance of other pathogenic organisms to be in the water — those organisms, bacteria and viruses that cause disease parasites. So that's the main number one concern right away. Secondarily, of course, you have this large amount of nutrients — wastewater contains a tremendous amount of of phosphorus and nitrogen — untreated wastewater. So we had that concern of additional nutrients coming into the lake besides what was brought in from the sediments and in the runoff from the stormwater and the flooding events. So hearing about that sewage break, did that just make you want to scream? Well, you know, it's very unfortunate that that happens, it was very good that they contained it, as soon as they can. We do have situations in a number of areas around the lake where we still have combined sewer and stormwater systems that overload the the wastewater treatment plants. And essentially, we do have situations during very heavy storms then, that even without a pipe break, we do get combined stormwater runoff with with some septic. So we see that occurring. But the fact that they were able to repair it fast was very helpful. But we will be looking to see what the what the outcome is in terms of that nutrient loading in terms of the lake response. Now, Jeff, I was down in North Beach on Lake Champlain over the weekend, and there were lots of folks swimming in the water and enjoying themselves. But I've also had conversations with folks who say, ""You know, after the flooding in July, after the the sewer line break, I don't want to get in the water right now."" So what's your guidance for folks on how to know when it is safe to swim? Well, there is a cyanobacteria tracker , that takes data from volunteers that work all around the lake that take water samples very often. And I was taking a look at those results just for over the weekend, for example. And even earlier this week, there are some actually from yesterday that aren't showing any heavy blooms — except for areas around St. Albans in that northern part of the lake, which which tends to be problematic all the time. So in terms of cyanobacteria, and they typically also test the beaches themselves — are tested for coliform bacteria to make sure that there wasn't any flow. Because it was relatively dry for a while, generally the ultraviolet sunlight will take care of a lot of pathogenic organisms at the surface in shallow waters. And when we do have rain events that don't bring in a whole mess of material, because they're short-term events that don't cause flooding, we do get at least some flushing of the base and embayments, so that we kind of wash out the cyanobacteria and dilute the other potential problematic organisms in there, and we get the lake flowing. It's really when we have the really quiet times and very hot weather, especially in the shallows and the embayments, or winds that are blowing from the the middle of the lake towards towards shore that we then tend to be concerned about the accumulation of cyanobacteria. So, you know, in general, you can never guarantee what the condition of the water is at any time. Even after it's just been monitored, because everything's moving about and everything's dynamic. But if you don't see a bloom, you shouldn't necessarily be that concerned about cyanobacteria. Because typically — as I said, even some of the blooms don't produce toxins — but we've never measured toxins where we didn't have a boom. Have questions, comments or tips?

Union Leader Staff Roberta Baker Author email Jul 27, 2023 Jul 27, 2023 Updated Aug 18, 2023 Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Cyanobacteria advisories indicate that a water body is not safe for swimming. NH DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Print Save Heavy rains, followed by heat and sun, are wreaking havoc with the state’s freshwater ponds, lakes and rivers, causing toxic bacteria blooms that can sicken swimmers, pets and wildlife. The state is on its way to a summer record number of cyanobacteria blooms, according to state data. Cyanobacteria clusters, varying in color from blue green to yellow-green, orange and even white, can cause skin irritations and gastrointestinal symptoms for humans and animals that come in contact or ingest them. This season’s weather pattern has been a perfect storm for algae blooms, which thrive on phosphorous and nitrogen that enter the water through runoff and erosion, according to environmental experts. “It’s a dangerous cycle now, with ideal growing conditions for toxic cyanobacteria,” said Andrea LaMoreaux, president of NH Lakes, a freshwater watchdog organization. “We’ve broken the record number of advisories for each month so far this year,” Kate Hastings, cyanobacteria bloom program manager for the state Department of Environmental Services, said Thursday. Advisories, which are issued when freshwater samples exceed safe levels for recreation, signal that people and pets should avoid swimming, wading or drinking the water. June saw the highest statewide total — 18 advisories in one month, Hastings said. This week, advisories are in effect at Province Lake in Wakefield and Effingham, Mirror Lake in Whitefield, Hunkins Pond in Sanbornton and Winona Lake in New Hampton and Center Harbor. Advisories have been removed at Mascoma Lake in Enfield and Lebanon, and Tucker Pond in Salisbury. Alerts, which mean cyanobacteria overgrowth has been detected and people should proceed with caution, have been issued at Swain’s Lake in Barrington, Pool Pond in Rindge, Crystal Lake in Enfield and Lebanon, Deering Reservoir in Deering and Silver Lake in Harrisville and Nelson. “For an alert, you don’t necessarily have to stay out. If you don’t see any bloom, the risk should be low. For an advisory, stay out of the water and keep pets out, too,” Hastings said. LaMoreaux said cyano-blooms tend to impact water bodies that are more developed, “but no lake is immune.” “It’s not just smaller lakes,” she said. Hastings said it’s hard to know with certainty that cyano-blooms are increasing over time as a result of changing weather patterns, because public awareness and reporting is also increasing statewide. E-Coli, a bacteria present in soil and fecal matter, this week exceeded safe levels in Webster Lake in Franklin. Not all freshwater bodies are sampled, and those tested may not be screened on a regular basis, Hastings said. Unhealthy growth spurt Extraordinarily heavy rainstorms are increasing erosion as well as runoff from fertilized lawns and septic system leaching fields. The water also contains more debris, including fallen tree limbs and wooden docks that have floated away, LaMoreaux said. Soil and sediment entering lakes and ponds have boosted the food supply for cyanobacteria. Phosphorous and heat from sunlight act as multipliers, triggering their exponential growth. Cyanobacteria typically inhabit fresh water, but at much lower and relatively harmless concentrations, until ideal conditions arise — like now. Cyanobacteria can look like scum, mats, spilled paint or paint chips. The water can turn blue, green, white, yellow or brownish, according to DES. Clusters can be blown or carried by waves, and toxins can remain for a period of time that depends on how frequently the water is mixed, LaMoreaux said. “It’s hard to know exactly when toxicity is gone or where the cyano-bloom actually is. You don’t know where it’s come from or where it’s going,” LaMoreaux said. “It’s best to err on the side of caution.’’ If the water looks unusual, discolored or suspicious, it may be wise to keep away, LaMoreaux said. Rinsing off quickly is a good way to prevent getting sick from swimming in fresh water that may contain high levels of cyanobacteria. Property owners should watch where erosion and runoff is coming from and divert it away from rivers, ponds and lakes when possible. Cyanobacteria tend to out-compete other phytoplankton in warmer temperatures, said Hastings at NH DES. When it comes to personal safety, “We really need to take personal responsibility and do our own risk assessment,” LaMoreaux said. “We still do have some of the cleanest lakes in this state, but there are times when health can be compromised. Enjoy them with a little bit more information to keep safe.” For more information, including current cyanobacteria advisories in New Hampshire: www.des.nh.gov/water/healthy-swimming/harmful-algal-blooms rbaker@unionleader.com Facebook Twitter Linkedin SMS Email Print Save Roberta Baker Author email Follow Roberta Baker SUBSCRIBE TODAY US restricts drilling and mining in Alaska wilderness, angering state leaders +2 U.S. designates PFAS chemicals as Superfund hazardous substances +2 Most Popular State rejects plan to dedicate most of state's largest private forest to carbon credits U.S. designates PFAS chemicals as Superfund hazardous substances Earth’s record hot streak might be a sign of a new climate era DES says new PFAS limits will be costly to implement Bow coal plant set to close by 2028 and become 'renewable energy park' Hooking a Maine fish is one thing, but is it safe to eat?

Ray Ewing News Government Nature & Science Cyanobacteria Reaches Red-Grade Status in Four Ponds Thomas Humphrey Thursday, July 27, 2023 - 4:06pm Print 7 Comments Clean, safe water in public ponds is no longer a given on Martha’s Vineyard. So far this summer, Islanders have been warned against going in or even coming in contact with parts of four different ponds because of harmful blooms of biotoxin-producing microbes. MVCyano, a coalition of local boards of health and the Great Pond Foundation, has issued “red-grade” cyanobacteria bloom advisories in Chilmark Pond, Tisbury Great Pond, James Pond and a pond at Mink Meadows. The group recommends against any and all contact with the potentially toxic water for humans and pets alike. Emily Reddington, the executive director of the Great Pond Foundation, holds a cyanobacteria advisory sign used to warn the public. 
          
        — Ray Ewing Several other ponds, including Squibnocket and Edgartown Great Pond, have had lower-level warnings. The proliferation of cyanobacteria blooms is a relatively recent trend on Martha’s Vineyard, an Island peppered with brackish ponds once thought to be inhospitable to the microorganisms that constitute these toxic blooms. Now, as waters warm and as nitrogen pollution disrupts coastal ecosystems, scientists and health officials are working to understand the causes and impacts of cyanobacteria blooms on-Island. “It’s right at the cutting edge of science,” said David Bouck, who recently took over as director of science and collaboration with the Great Pond Foundation. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, is a group of single-celled, photosynthetic organisms widespread in ponds, oceans and estuaries across the globe. When present in high concentrations, known as blooms, some cyanobacteria species can produce “cyanotoxins” toxic to humans and dogs. Knowledge about how cyanobacteria behave in conditions present on the Vineyard, however, is limited. During an interview at the foundation’s laboratory, Mr. Bouck brandished the 1,000-plus-page World Health Organization guide to cyanobacteria. “The body of knowledge is constantly changing, there’s a lot we just don’t know yet,” he said. “They update this every year . . . but it mostly deals with freshwater ecosystems.” The collaboration that became MVCyano had its roots in 2020. Several consecutive years of visible blooms and tests indicating high levels of cyanotoxins in the ponds impelled the boards of health and the foundation to map out a game plan for how to deal with the phenomenon. “We didn’t have a way to test if there was a bloom, or to communicate if there was a bloom or take samples from the right place if there was a bloom,” said Emily Reddington, executive director of the Great Ponds Foundation. “When we didn’t know what to do, we did a lot of research to find out who did.” The blueprint for the Vineyard, it turns out, is from another island in the northeast. Researchers on Long Island in New York who studied the brackish estuaries in the Hamptons had seen the blooms for years. David Bouck with the Great Pond Foundation said the Island is still learning about cyanobacteria. 
          
        — Ray Ewing “They are warmer, and they have greater development pressures, so it’s like the Vineyard into the future if nothing is changed,” Ms. Reddington said. The foundation teamed up with the Gobler Laboratory at Stony Brook University to take advantage of that expertise. While Mr. Bouck can identify the presence of a bloom with his lab equipment, researchers at Stony Brook are able to identify individual species — no easy feat when it comes to cyanobacteria. “Cyanobacteria are always there, and they always have been,” Mr. Bouck said, noting that the microorganisms were among the first photosynthetic life forms to evolve on earth, giving them millennia to diversify. The mere presence of cyanobacteria, Mr. Bouck said, is not the problem – only when environmental factors cause the microbe to unnaturally proliferate does it begin to pose a threat to other organisms. “A cyanobacteria bloom is a sign of an ecosystem out of balance,” he said. That imbalance is typically caused by nitrogen pollution in the ponds, he said, which he said has its origins in home septic systems. That assertion was confirmed by a study completed by the foundation last year, which identified septic systems as the primary source of nitrogen pollution in Island ponds. Increased nitrogen gives cyanobacteria an extra boost to grow in brackish Vineyard estuaries, which, Ms. Reddington said, can have knock-on effects for human toxicity. “We’re dealing with cyanobacteria that they didn’t think could be in marine situations . . . that are the extremes of their tolerance,” she said. “If you stress out a cyanobacteria . . . it gets pretty upset, and under that stress condition it might produce higher than expected levels of cyanotoxin.” The group’s current effort is focused on unraveling the complex interactions contributing to and resulting from blooms, with the foundation testing water samples collected by the boards of health and from stations monitored by their staff. The group also started a study into the genetic material in those samples, hoping to understand how cyanobacteria interact with other microbes in Island waters. Increased awareness of blooms has also helped the foundation improve their coverage. Squibnocket Pond has a lower-level warning. 
          
        — Ray Ewing “We also sometimes get reports from the public that say, ‘I see something green, can you come take a sample?’” Ms. Reddington said. The identifications of blooms in the Tisbury Great Pond and at Mink Meadows this year were both the result of public reporting. But to fix the issue at its source will require a major shift in current Island trends and attitudes, according to Mr. Bouck. “Nutrient issues are kind of becoming more of an issue. Temperatures are increasing and pace of development has increased,” he said. “We need to change the way that we interact with the ecosystem to bring it back into balance.” Thomas Humphrey More by Thomas Humphrey Cyanobacteria Tisbury Great Pond Water quality Comments (7) Michael Stone , North Tisbury unfortunately here we go again. over development large homes causing environmental damages to a precious ecosystem. It will be fascinating to see what it takes for the ponds to recuperate? We’re certainly not going to stop developing. When we can’t swim in our ponds or the ponds do not generate new life we have changed in Vineyard forever. Let’s hope commonsense can prevail! July 28, 2023 - 7:11am reply Judith Scheuer , Chilmark This is very concerning. I recommend the film Toxic Puzzle    https://www.toxicpuzzle.com/ July 28, 2023 - 9:41am reply Carol , formerly Chilmark Heartbreaking (tho not surprising) to see Chilmark Pond on this list.  This island needs comprehensive sewer systems or advanced (innovative/alternative) septic systems - for every home.   Towns should start planning how that will happen and how the town will help economically disadvantaged residents to make the shift. July 28, 2023 - 5:21pm reply Anna Edey , Vineyard Haven Yes, we need to do what DEP was planning to require:  75% reduction of nitrogen pollution within 5 years, by applying I/A tech on all Title 5 systems located within the various watershed areas that drain to our various ponds.
But the current projected costs for DEP-approved I/A tech are terrifying: $37-49,000. 
However, there are equally effective I/A systems that cost 50-75% less than those that have been approved by DEP. Now's the time to give local permits for such systems, under strict protocol of inspectings and testing, performed by a trained all-island team, administered under our boards of health. August 1, 2023 - 1:58pm reply Mark , West Tisbury I learned to swim in Great Tisbury Pond 65 years ago. Too bad the children of all those parents with bright green ""suburban"" lawns in the ponds' watersheds today won't have the same joy. July 28, 2023 - 7:02pm reply Bob , Edgartown Why is farmland always left out of the equation when we talk about the water issue in ponds? July 30, 2023 - 4:22am reply Anna Edey , Vineyard Haven Because farmlands cause only about 4% of the nitrogen pollution, compared with 60-80% from Title 5 septic systems.

Photo by Arizbeth Rojas / The Dartmouth By Taylor Haber Published July 21, 2023 On July 14, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services issued a cyanobacteria harmful algal bloom advisory for Mascoma Lake, according to a statement from the Lebanon Police Department. The NHDES, which conducts cyanobacteria safety tests, found that levels in Mascoma Lake reached 100,800 cells per milliliter — above the 70,000 cells/mL recreational threshold. The statement wrote that lake-goers should avoid swimming or wading in the water, especially near blooms, while the advisory remains in effect. “The fact that there was enough to exceed the recreational threshold is really the important cut-off that we have for our program to help keep people safe through recreation,” NHDES Cyanobacteria Harmful Algal Bloom Program Manager Kate Hastings said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes cyanobacteria, which is a type of phytoplankton, as a blue-green colored algae. Blooms form when significant amounts of cyanobacteria build up in bodies of water, and are capable of producing toxins harmful to humans and wildlife. Bloom growth depends on a number of contributing factors, though experts have identified water temperature, flow and turbidity as several root causes. Recreating around areas with high cyanobacteria levels, even without physically being in the water, can also cause “chronic exposure,” Hastings said. It is possible for cyanobacteria to be inhaled through aerosols in the form of water droplets. Depending on exposure, toxins from cyanobacteria can cause a range of health problems, from skin and nose irritation, to nausea and vomiting in milder cases, Hastings said. In rare instances, when cyanobacteria produce neurotoxins, those symptoms can include seizures, nervous system or organ failure or prove fatal, she added. Health officials will ressample Mascoma Lake once a week until its cyanobacteria levels have returned to normal, Hastings said, adding that advisories this year have typically remained in place for one to two weeks. Mascoma Lake serves as the training area for the Dartmouth men’s and women’s sailing teams and is home to the Dartmouth Yacht Club, which conducts undergraduate PE sailing classes in the summer. Director of the Dartmouth Yacht Club John Brady wrote in an email statement that “[w]e have made appropriate adjustments to our programing at the sailing center for positive cyanobacteria readings,” though he did not elaborate on what those changes entailed. Brady could not be reached for further comment. In spite of the advisory, the DYC has continued to run PE classes on its normal schedule. Heather Wang ’25, who is enrolled in a summer sailing course and spends approximately two hours every Wednesday on Mascoma Lake, said she doesn’t “see that [the DYC] have taken any extra precautions.” “We put on the same gear, we sailed the same waters,” Wang said. When told by an instructor about the advisory, Wang said that she and other students were given the option to use boats that were less likely to capsize in case anyone wished to avoid direct contact with the water. However, students in Wang’s PE class were not provided with specific information about potential negative health impacts prior to their lesson. “We did not know what the actual effects were,” Wang said. “One of the students asked the instructor, and what he said was basically that he didn’t really know, either.” Wang said that she plans to “wait and see whether the conditions on the lake improve” before her lesson next week. In order to receive their PE credit, students in sailing classes are able to miss one lesson and reschedule a second class for another time slot. Summer sailing instructor Rebecca Risch ’25 said she has not “heard of any changes” to students’ attendance requirements that would accommodate advisory-related absences. Risch added that while she knew of cyanobacteria “vaguely,” she explained she was not previously aware of the more threatening health risks or of anyone who had personally suffered from exposure. In terms of new safety policy, Risch said PE classes have been offering students the choice of using a Rhodes — a boat which keeps students from getting wet and requires an instructor accompaniment — rather than the more typical dinghy. “[In] my class, everyone still wanted to sail in the dinghies, but I have heard they’ve been sending out the Rhodes more,” Risch said. While the advisory remains in place, Wang said she plans to do further research to properly evaluate the health risks. “I think it’s just a matter of knowing more about it and just seeing whether we should return,” Wang said.

Location of the reservoirs in the province of Salta and photographs of them. Credit: Alvarez Dalinger, Florencia, and Borja, Claudia Harmful algal blooms (HABs), characterized by the proliferation of detrimental algae and cyanobacteria, occur worldwide. HABs include any event causing adverse effects on human health, socioeconomic interests, or aquatic systems. The consequences of HABs are far-reaching, ranging from the production of potentially harmful or lethal toxins to the creation of hypoxic or anoxic zones, elevated water treatment costs, and a decline in water body quality and usability. In a new study published in Water Biology and Security , a team of researchers in Argentina has reported observed different patterns for cyanobacteria and dinoflagellate blooms in reservoirs located in Salta, a province in the north of the country. ""Our laboratory is the only one conducting this type of analysis in the province of Salta,"" says Florencia Soledad Alvarez Dalinger, first and co-corresponding author of the study. ""We came across numerous results accumulated over the past 15 years that had not been published, and we believed it would be valuable to compile and highlight them."" The team examined massive algae and cyanobacteria blooms in the region across five reservoirs, of which two are sources for drinking water. The researchers identified cyanotoxins using a new kit developed by CONICET (Buenos Aires). ""The kit allowed us to conduct simple and cost-effective determinations. Moreover, our involvement in these quantifications contributed to validating the kit, which proved highly sensitive and serves as a valuable tool for continued long-term sampling,"" adds Dalinger. The team found that in recent years, cyanobacteria blooms have become more intense, particularly in the reservoirs located in the warmest areas of the region. Additionally, positive records of cyanotoxins were observed only in the last four years of the period. ""Previously, such results had not been reported in our province, although they had been documented in other bodies of water in Argentina,"" says Dalinger. ""This suggests a significant discrepancy in the data and an underestimation of the real scope of the problem."" The team highlights the challenges they face in conducting this study, including the high costs of the kits and reagents, as well as the fact that their laboratory is composed of mainly early-career female researchers.

Lori Fisher, Executive Director of the Lake Champlain Committee, has a team of people who test and report the results of the water daily, looking for cyanobacteria.  It's important work because cyanobacteria can be toxic to humans and pets. Fisher says it can affect the nervous system, liver and your skin. In fact, back in 2019, toxins from cyanobacteria poisoned and killed two dogs in Stowe.""With our warming waters, we're seeing a greater frequency of blooms and blooms showing up in areas that in the past, we didn't tend to see them,"" said Fisher.  Cyanobacteria takes just three things to produce: nutrients, sunlight and warm temperatures. Recently, Lake Champlain got a whole lot of extra nutrients during the July floods.

(WCAX) - This summer is off to a rough start for beach-goers in Burlington, who have encountered more alerts due to cyanobacteria blooms than normal. Environmental experts say with higher temperatures thanks to climate change, we are seeing these blooms more frequently and earlier in the season. North Beach in Burlington was very empty on one of the hottest days of the year. “We’ve never closed this early and we’ve never closed for cyanobacteria on the third and fourth before we had to this year,” said Alec Kaeding, the Burlington Waterfront operations manager. Kaeding lamented closing the beach on such a hot day. It followed a number of beach closings along Burlington’s shoreline in recent weeks. “I also look at it like by us doing what we’re doing, we’re stopping people from getting sick. So, I mean that’s a good thing, too, but it is hard having to close the beach on the nicest day of the year,” Kaeding said. Cyanobacteria blooms, which often show up on hot days, can produce toxins that can impact the skin and bodily organs, make people sick and even kill animals. That’s why once a bloom is spotted somewhere, Burlington closes that beach for at least 24 hours. “I think they’re being appropriately cautious. There were places around the country where, you know, a whole host of beach-goers had been sent to the hospital because they were swimming at a beach with cyanobacteria. We need to be really protective; cyanobacteria can produce cyanotoxins,” said Lori Fisher of the Lake Champlain Committee. However, beach-goers in Burlington were disappointed on such a hot day. “To be honest, I didn’t know the beach was closed until we got there. As someone new to Vermont, I haven’t quite sussed that you have to research these things first. But the sun’s out, the weather is gorgeous anyway, so we’ll make do. It’s just a shame we can’t cool off in the water,” said Harriette Arellano-Setterington of Essex. “I mean, we all in the car, we’re like, ‘Oh my god, again?’ Because it’s closed every single time we want to go swimming and it’s been so hot lately. So, it definitely sucks to be out here in the sun and not cool off,” said Caitlin McCoy of Burlington. The state has a tracker that shows the current status of Lake Champlain beaches and inland lakes. However, smaller municipalities don’t have the same number of staff Burlington does, making it harder to be as diligent as the Queen City. “Burlington is being appropriately, you know, proactive in when they see cyanobacteria at levels that we call a low alert or a high alert. They are closing beaches. That doesn’t happen everywhere. We wish it would,” Fisher said. That’s why the Lake Champlain Committee trains municipalities and citizen cyanobacteria spotters to look out for it to prevent children, adults or animals from getting sick. On Wednesday, Blanchard and North beaches were closed due to cyanobacteria blooms, along with other beaches down Lake Champlain. The city will check the beaches again Thursday morning to see if they can open them up on a day that is expected to be even hotter. Click here for the latest on Burlington beaches.

NH News By Degrees: Covering Climate Change Climate change is making cyanobacteria worse. Here's what you can do to prevent it. New Hampshire Public Radio | 
                    By Adriana Martinez-Smiley Published June 19, 2023 at 6:00 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Courtesy / Lake Kanasatka Watershed Association Lake Kanasatka with a cyanobacterial bloom that changed the color of the water in Aug. 2020. As spring winds down and summer emerges, cyanobacteria season is also kicking into gear. While more people set foot into New Hampshire’s lakes and ponds, local environmental advocates are trying to find ways to mitigate and remove cyanobacterial blooms. That includes making sure people understand how their actions contribute to that growth. Why should you care about cyanobacteria? Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found in all marine environments , including New Hampshire’s lakes. Changes in weather trends — such as more severe yet infrequent rainstorms, as well as increasing temperatures — are allowing cyanobacteria populations to boom, said Kate Hastings, who manages cyanobacteria blooms with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. “When we have disturbances to the environment, cyanobacteria tend to be the ones that take advantage of that situation and grow out of control into these blooms,” Hastings said. Cyanobacteria itself isn’t necessarily a concern, but when it reaches a certain density, it can release cyanotoxins. “We can't really tell if a bloom is toxic just by looking at it. The wind can blow, then it accumulates somewhere else and it could magnify in concentration and therefore toxins,” said Amanda McQuaid, a state specialist in water quality and ecotoxicology. Hastings said the state issued its earliest-ever cyanobacteria advisory this year — on May 16 — coupled with the most advisories issued in the month of May. While the toxins cyanobacteria can produce are the greatest concern, McQuaid said, they’re also the hardest to understand. Some toxins can spur allergic reactions, including skin rashes. Others have the potential to cause nervous system failure or liver damage . In New Hampshire, if cyanobacteria cell density reaches 70,000 per ml of water, the state will issue an advisory to avoid that particular water body. State officials also recently launched a Healthy Swimming Mapper , which lists active alerts and advisories. These lakes won’t close down, but people are putting themselves at risk if they don’t heed the department’s advice. Other factors such as urbanization have also been disturbing local lake ecosystems. What can you do to decrease your contribution to cyanobacteria blooms? NH Lakes, a non-profit that works to preserve the health of lakes across the state, runs a LakeSmart program meant to show people how they can make a positive difference in the health of their lakes. They offer a self-assessment survey to help people determine their potential role in cyanobacteria blooms. Homeowners can answer questions about how they manage their property, and what they do around or in the lake. Once submitted, it generates a personalized report of ways they are promoting the health of their lakes. It also gives recommendations on how they can manage their properties to preserve lake health. “Homeowners are unwittingly introducing pollutants into the lake for these toxic bacteria to really grow and thrive,” said NH Lakes President Andrea LaMoreaux. In June 2021, the Lake Kanasatka Watershed Association (or LKWA) completed a shoreline survey looking at 182 waterfront properties and found that 66% of the properties are likely having a negative impact on the lake. The survey was completed as part of their watershed management plan , which was published last August to identify pollutant sources and recommend ways to manage them. Emily R. D. Kennedy / foreverseptember on Flickr / https://flic.kr/p/9D7DXd / https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/ Lake Kanasatka, Apr. 29 2011. While there aren’t any farms or golf courses around Lake Kanasatka, which are common bloom instigators, LKWA board member Lisa Hutchinson said homeowners introducing fertilizers, planting grass up to the shoreline and trimming away native plants can also cause blooms. Cyanobacteria thrives off of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which are commonly found in fertilizers. During intense rainstorms, grass doesn’t absorb stormwater well, leading to runoff carrying these nutrients and other pollutants into the lakes. And if native plants are removed from the shoreline, this runoff has direct entry into the water. “To some homeowners, it's easier to mow to the edge [of the lake] to see every little bit of that beautiful lake water,” Hutchinson said. “But the fact of the matter is it's not healthy for our lakes, and that's not what nature intended.” What other steps are being taken to contain cyanobacteria? Last year, state legislators passed a law that directed the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services to form a cyanobacteria advisory committee. The agency is scheduled to issue a statewide plan to potentially control and reduce cyanobacteria populations in November. “There's several technologies out there now that potentially can remedy blooms, but many of them would require a permit here from the department,” said Dave Neils, who sits on the advisory committee and serves as chief aquatic biologist at the state environmental agency. “We just don't have a standardized rule set or law right now that allows us to do that. We're making do with what we have in a couple instances so far.” State environmental officials used aluminum compounds, which bind to excess nutrients, to treat Nimpo Lake back in 2021, and they said they haven’t seen a cyanobacterial bloom there since. However, Neils said the planning and materials for that project cost about $200,000. Ideally, Neils said, it’s best to avoid the blooms altogether, and getting rid of one is a last ditch effort. And that’s where advocates say people can be part of the solution. “My advice is for people to not throw their hands up and say, ‘well, there's nothing I can do about toxic bacteria in my lake,’” said LaMoreaux, with NH Lakes. “Environmental problems [related to] climate change can seem really overwhelming.” Tags NH News Cyanobacteria Climate & Recreation Lakes water pollution Department of Environmental Services New England News Collaborative Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Adriana Martinez-Smiley Adriana (she/they) was a news intern in the summer of 2023, reporting on environment, energy and climate news as part of By Degrees .

Emmanuelle Javaux Miguel Ángel Criado Jan 04, 2024 - 20:28 CET Whatsapp Facebook Twitter Linkedin Copy link The first half of the history of life on Earth was written by bacteria. And for millions of years they did so without the need for oxygen, which was absent from the atmosphere at that time. Now, the oldest structures that some of these microorganisms used to fill the planet with gaseous oxygen (O₂) have been discovered. A species from about 1.75 billion years ago already had something similar to vesicles called thylakoids that allowed them to increase their ability to photosynthesize. These thylakoids are still present in the planet’s cyanobacteria, algae and plants that convert sunlight into chemical energy. Photosynthesis was a brilliant mechanism by which, at some point in the beginnings of life on the planet, cyanobacteria learned to convert the energy coming from the Sun into the chemical energy they needed. In the process, they took electrons from compounds present in their environment. At a time more than 2.4 billion years ago, certain groups of cyanobacteria learned to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis. They took in water (H₂O), which was an abundant fuel, from which they obtained the hydrogen necessary to assimilate carbon from CO₂ in the atmosphere. In their metabolism, they released the excess waste, oxygen, which must have been consumed by oxidizing the minerals in the rocks. But around 2.4 billion years ago, the so-called Great Oxidation Event occurred, due to which the Earth’s atmosphere accumulated up to 1% O₂. It may not seem like much (the current concentration is close to 21%), but the foundations were then laid for an extraordinary diversification of living beings. Cyanobacteria were responsible for that event. Some have been found in the fossil record before the Great Oxidation Event, but what has just been discovered is part of their engineering. In a site in Australia, scientists found microfossils of a microorganism called Navifusa majensis , it was believed to be a cyanobacteria, but it is not easy to identify a bug like this, which barely measures 25 microns — a micron is one thousandth of a millimeter — compacted in a fossilization process 1.75 billion years ago. As detailed in a paper published in Nature , its discoverers have found thylakoids in the N cell. majensis . These vesicles contain photosensitive elements that convert light into chemical energy. Cyanobacteria that carried out oxygenic photosynthesis had already been discovered, but such ancient thylakoids had not. “Cyanobacteria are important because the oxygen we have on the planet is the result of the activity of these biological organisms” Patricia Sánchez Baracaldo, microbiologist with the University of Bristol, United Kingdom The thylakoids that have now been discovered represent the first direct evidence of oxygenic photosynthesis with these basic units. As the researcher at the University of Liège (Belgium) and senior author of the research, Emmanuelle Javaux, says, the discovery “shows that cyanobacteria were actively producing oxygen 1.75 billion years ago, so in reality the sediments of the McDermott Formation [in the region of Australia where they have been found] they were not formed in a permanent or completely anoxic environment.” Before the Great Oxidation Event, there must not have been many corners, niches, where life based on oxygen had refuge. But the scenario changed after the event. “We are now digging into the even older fossil record to test the proposed hypothesis that the appearance of thylakoid membranes may have contributed to the increase in oxygen around the Great Oxidation Event and the permanent oxygenation of the early Earth,” Javaux adds. Patricia Sánchez Baracaldo, a microbiologist at the University of Bristol (United Kingdom), explains that “there was oxygen before the Great Oxidation Event, but they were strongholds.” For Sánchez Baracaldo, who investigates the bacterial origin of life, “cyanobacteria are important because the oxygen we have on the planet is the result of the activity of these biological organisms.” The Colombian scientist, who also investigates the origin of photosynthesis, remembers that “oxygen did not exist, bacteria invented how to extract electrons from water by breaking it, and it was that oxygen that accumulated.” And she adds: “That is why it is important to determine when this type of photosynthesis appeared, which is something that has fascinated scientists and the general public because without oxygen, evolution would not have led to us.” About 200 species of cyanobacteria have been described and only two do not have thylakoids. In fact, the first cyanobacteria did not have these structures. With these organelles in their membranes, the microorganisms must have expanded their photosynthetic capacity and, therefore, increased the generation of oxygen. The new element was creating new ecological niches and, as Sánchez Baracaldo, who did not participate in this work, points out, “there were unicellular organisms that probably began to learn to breathe that oxygen.” Complex life appears millions of years later, when the accumulation of O₂ was increasing, accelerated by at least two new similar events after the Great Oxidation Event. “Oxygen accumulated so much that it opens the possibility for animals to evolve. That is when the first eukaryotes appeared.” From these first eukaryotes, which were still unicellular organisms, those that must have engulfed some cyanobacteria would later emerge, initiating the greatest example of endosymbiosis in the history of life. From these organisms which had absorbed cyanobacteria with thylakoids inside, chloroplasts would arise that allow algae and plants to carry out the same photosynthesis today. “In cyanobacteria with thylakoids, the membrane surface multiplies very significantly and so does the cell’s ability to photosynthesize” Purificación López, researcher at University of Paris-Saclay, France Purificación López, a researcher at the CNRS - Center National de la Recherche Scientifique (France), who was not involved in this study, recalls where the importance of thylakoids lies: “They increase the surface area where the photosystems are located, which is where photosynthesis can take place.” There are other groups of cyanobacteria that do not have these structures and carry out photosynthesis in the outer membrane. “In cyanobacteria with thylakoids, the membrane surface multiplies very significantly and, so does the cell’s ability to photosynthesize. What is important about this research is that they are seeing these fossilized thylakoids. It is an astonishing level of conservation of 1.75 billion years,” the Spanish microbiologist and professor at the University of Paris-Saclay adds. In a sense, the Great Oxidation Event carried out by cyanobacteria has parallels with the K–Pg event, the mass extinction of animal life due to the impact of a meteorite 66 million years ago. If the K-Pg event created the conditions for the diversification of mammals, which were just small animals at the time, the Great Oxidation Event laid the foundations for the arrival of multicellular organisms and of complex life. López likes the analogy, but rejects its essential premise: “During the Great Oxidation of the atmosphere there was no extinction. New oxygenated habitats were surely created, where there is indeed a diversification of oxygenic photosynthetic organisms and aerobic organisms that use oxygen. But the others did not disappear, they continued to exist in places where there was no oxygen, and there are still anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms in lakes, in sediments, and in microbial mats, and there is still very significant anaerobic biology, even in our intestine, our microbiome.” Sign up for our weekly newsletter to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition More information A strange pancake-shaped creature shows the origin of thought Manuel Ansede | Madrid ‘We are half human, half bacteria’: What the microbes in our bodies can do for us Jessica Mouzo Archived In Bacteria Evolution Adheres to More information If you are interested in licensing this content, please contact ventacontenidos@prisamedia.com _ newsletter Sign up to EL PAÍS in English Edition bulletin Apúntate Most viewed ‘We have consistently flirted with death’: The construction problems in Elon Musk’s tunnels Hollywood has ‘Ozempic face’: Why you can look 10 years older after going all in on the slimming drug A decade of sargassum damage is suffocating Caribbean ecosystems John Travolta, the 70-year-old semi-retired widower soaring over Hollywood The books that lay hidden behind a wall for five centuries in Spain Recomendaciones EL PAÍS Cursos Centros Francés online Inglés online Italiano online Alemán online Crucigramas & Juegos Cursos cursos Maestría en línea en Administración de Empresas con concentración en Marketing Digital cursos Maestría en línea en Dirección de Recursos Humanos cursos Maestría en línea en Psicopedagogía cursos Curso en línea de Diseño Gráfico Centros cursosonline Maestría en Administración de Empresas con concentración en Transformación Digital y Desarrollo de Negocios cursosonline Curso en línea de experto en Calidad Industrial y Procesos Farmacéuticos cursosonline Maestría en línea en Programación Web cursosonline Maestría en línea en Ciencias en Educación Virtual Francés online cursosingles Mejora tu francés con 15 minutos al día cursosingles Disfruta de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidas. cursosingles Obtendrá un diploma con estadísticas de nivel, progresión y participación. cursosingles 21 días de prueba gratuita de nuestro curso de francés ‘online’ Inglés online cursosingles Mejore su inglés con EL PAÍS con 15 minutos al día cursosingles Disfrute de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidas cursosingles Evalúe su nivel y obtenga un certificado cursosingles Pruebe 21 días gratis y sin compromiso Italiano online cursosingles Mejore su italiano con EL PAÍS con 15 minutos al día cursosingles Disfrute de nuestras lecciones personalizadas, breves y divertidas cursosingles Evalúe su nivel y obtenga un certificado cursosingles Pruebe 21 días gratis y sin compromiso Alemán online cursosingles Las mejores oportunidades hablan alemán.

A hiker in the Virgin River at the Zion Narrows at Zion National Park in Utah. Mark Ralston / AFP-Getty Images file Print Aug. 2, 2023, 10:17 PM UTC By Maia Pandey Toxic bacteria have been detected in several bodies of water in Utah’s Zion National Park, the National Park Service announced this week . Three bodies of water in the park have cyanotoxins in them, according to the Park Service: the North Fork of the Virgin River, North Creek and La Verkin Creek. These toxins are produced by a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. The algae is common in ponds and lakes and not always dangerous, but it can grow into large blooms that produce cyanotoxins. In people, symptoms of cyanotoxin exposure include irritation in the eyes, ears, nose, throat or skin, as well as headache, seizures, vomiting and diarrhea. In animals and pets, symptoms include drooling, low energy, lack of appetite, paralysis and vomiting. In very rare cases, cyanotoxin poisoning can be fatal. The NPS has advised visitors against swimming or submerging their heads in the affected Zion waterways and warned people not to drink water from anywhere in the park. The watches and warnings extend to popular areas of the park, including The Narrows and Emerald Pools. If exposed, people should seek immediate medical attention and call poison control or 911, the NPS said. The NPS attributed the blooms in Zion to an extended period without floods, which has allowed cyanobacteria to grow rapidly and unchecked. Climate change and pollution play a role in the proliferation of cyanobacteria, according to Ramesh Goel, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Utah. Human activity pollutes water with nitrogen and phosphorus, which then fuel the growth of blue-green algae, Goel said. Fertilizer runoff and lingering pollutants in wastewater processed in treatment plants both send excess nutrients into rivers and lakes, he said. “In states like Utah, you have the snow melting, and the snow melting from watersheds brings more nutrients to the water,” Goel said. Rising temperatures across the country — which research suggests are linked to climate change — also create optimal conditions for the bacteria to grow, he added. In lakes and reservoirs, cyanobacteria look like blue-green paint floating on the water’s surface, according to David Stevens, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Utah State University. But in rivers, like the Virgin River currently affected in Utah, the bacteria often grow on rocks around the water and can look like slimy mud. Cyanobacteria can grow on surfaces like rocks, sticks and sand. The yellow/brown, vein-textured material in this photo is cyanobacteria. NPS Even getting clothing wet counts as exposure, Stevens said. “It doesn’t matter if you have a shirt on or something like that because once your shirt’s wet, it’s no different than having a bare arm,” he said. “Just stay away from the water, and you’ll be fine.” Anyone who comes into contact with contaminated water should immediately wash that area of their body with soap and water, Stevens added. In the past month, local health officials have issued warnings about cyanotoxin detections in waterways in Montana , Oregon and Minnesota , among other states. Last month, over 50 beaches were closed for swimming in Massachusetts due to excess bacteria, some of which was cyanobacteria. In 2018, toxic blooms of blue-green algae caused a smell in parts of Southwest Florida that persisted for months. Stevens said another reason for the increasing presence of cyanotoxins is that people are building more houses along lake shores and discharging septic systems into the water, which leads to less clear, more algae-ridden lakes. Livestock and wild animals can also pollute water with their waste, he added. Cyanobacteria are among the oldest microorganisms on the planet. “They’ve been here millions of years and they’re thrived under lots of different conditions,” Stevens said. “What we need to do is make sure we don’t create conditions that are going to cause toxic problems.” Maia Pandey Maia Pandey is an intern at NBC News.

Here, the synthesis of phycobiliprotein is confirmed to be much earlier than that of photosystem components during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis and an unknown protein Ssr1698 is discovered to be involved in this synthetic process. The unknown protein is further identified as a c -type heme oxygenase ( c HO) in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway and catalyzes the opening of heme ring to form biliverdin IXα, which is required for phycobilin production and ensuing phycobiliprotein synthesis. In addition, the c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein is found to be vital for the growth of cyanobacterial cells during chlorosis and regreening through its nitrogen-storage and light-harvesting functions, respectively. Collectively, the c HO expressed preferentially during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis is identified in photosynthetic organisms and the dual function of this enzyme-dependent phycobiliprotein is proposed to be an important mechanism for acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment.

It has been widely accepted that the aquatic environment that they inhabit is overwhelmed with the nutrient stress of nitrogen fluctuations 7 , 8 , 9 . Very fortunately, numerous mechanisms of acclimating to the nitrogen-fluctuating environment have been developed in aquatic cyanobacterial cells and they can jointly alleviate such stress and guarantee an efficient nitrogen storage and photosynthetic CO 2 fixation 10 , 11 , 12 . Chlorosis of non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is induced by nitrogen starvation and their regreening is triggered after the nutrient becomes available 13 . In this process, glycogen is accumulated efficiently in nitrogen-starved cells and its breakdown is of great importance for rapid regreening of chlorotic cells as their respiratory substrate with the aid of glycogen phosphorylase 12 , 13 , 14 . In contrast, the peripheral light-harvesting antenna phycobilisome of cyanobacteria and their photosystems are synthesized in nitrogen-replete cells and their degradation triggered by nitrogen starvation is vital to provide additional amino-acids and decrease excitation pressure 15 , 16 , 17 . In addition, cyanophycin, a co-polymer of aspartate and arginine, is also synthesized under nitrogen-replete conditions as a nitrogen reservoir and is utilized under nitrogen limitation as nitrogen source with the cooperation of cyanophycinase, isoaspartyl dipeptidase, and arginine dihydrolase (ArgZ) 18 . Recently, an active ornithine–ammonia cycle (OAC) is identified in cyanobacteria and the OAC allows for efficient storage of cyanophycin in nitrogen-replete cells and its rapid utilization in nitrogen-starved cells 11 . Collectively, much progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms underlying the acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations, but our understanding is still far from complete. The recently reported proteomic data indicated that synthesis of phycobiliprotein (PBP) is much earlier than that of photosystem components after the nitrate is added to chlorotic cells 19 and heme oxygenase (HO) is required for the early synthesis of PBP through catalyzing the opening of the heme ring with the release of iron to form biliverdin 20 . In cyanobacteria, two canonical types of b -type heme oxygenase, b HO-1 and b HO-2, have been identified 21 , 22 , but the c -type heme oxygenase ( c HO) remains a mystery, although it has been identified in bacteria 23 , 24 . This reminds us that there may be an unknown mechanism underlying the acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations. Inspired by this possibility, we first confirmed that the synthesis of PBP during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis was much earlier than that of photosystem components and discovered that an unknown protein Ssr1698 was involved in this synthetic process. Then, the unknown protein was identified as a c -type heme oxygenase ( c HO) in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway and catalyzed the opening of heme ring to form biliverdin IXα, which was required for phycobilin production and ensuing PBP synthesis. Finally, the c HO-dependent PBP was found to be vital for the growth of cells during chlorosis and regreening through its nitrogen-storage and light-harvesting functions, respectively, and its dual function was proposed to be an important mechanism for acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment. Results The early synthesis of phycobiliprotein during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis Consistent with the recently reported proteomic data 19 , our protein blot results confirmed that the synthesis of phycobiliprotein (PBP) was much earlier than that of components of PSI and PSII after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells (Fig. 1a, b, f and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ). This finding was consolidated by the data of assembly and function of PBP, PSI, and PSII components after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells (Fig. 1c–f and Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Collectively, apart from the light-harvesting function, it is logical to hypothesize that the early synthesis of PBP during recovery from the nitrogen chlorosis may also serve as a nitrogen reservoir and function in ensuing nitrogen-starved cells.

Full size image Involvement of an unknown protein Ssr1698 in the early synthesis of phycobiliprotein during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis To test this hypothesis, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was conducted after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells for 4 h (i.e., at an early stage) or not. Our transcriptomic data showed that the 168 genes were upregulated after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells and they include many apo-PBP-related genes that encode rod subunits, core subunits, rod linker, rod-core linker, and core-membrane linker, but rarely include those known genes that encode catalytic enzymes in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway for phycobilin production (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ), which is required for PBP synthesis. It appears plausible that certain unknown catalytic enzymes are involved in the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of PBP during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis. To test this possibility and explore the possible novel mechanisms underlying the acclimation of cyanobacteria to the nitrogen-fluctuating environment, the top five upregulated unknown genes in our transcriptomic data were selected as candidates for PBP synthesis to construct their mutants and measure their levels of accumulated PBP after the nitrogen becomes available (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). As deduced from the accumulated PBP levels, we fortunately found that deletion of ssr1698 gene suppressed the synthesis of PBP and ensuing its assembly and function after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells for 12 h (Fig. 2a–f and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Taken together, we propose that the unknown protein Ssr1698 is involved in the early synthesis of PBP during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis. Fig. 2: Ssr1698 is of great importance for synthesis, assembly, and function of phycobiliprotein during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis. a A comparative transcriptomic analysis was conducted after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells for 4 h or not, and a top one upregulated unknown gene ssr1698 (see arrow) in our transcriptomic data was selected as a candidate for synthesis, assembly, and function of phycobiliprotein after the nitrogen becomes available. b Construction of the plasmid used to generate the ssr1698 -deletion mutant (Δ ssr1698 ). c Western analysis of Ssr1698 from the total protein of the WT (including indicated serial dilutions) and Δ ssr1698 strains.

Error bars denote the standard deviations of eight independent measurements ( n = 8); ***Represents P < 0.0001 ( P = 1.5 × 10 −7 ). Full size image Identification of Ssr1698 as a c -type heme oxygenase Ssr1698 is a 96-amino acid protein with a DUF2470 domain and is conserved only in cyanobacteria (Supplementary Fig. 6 ), but its DUF2470 domain is identified also in bacterial HugZ and ChuZ (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 7 ) and is predicted to provide the interacting interface with heme 25 , 26 . To test this prediction, we carried out the heme titration of the purified tag-less Ssr1698 protein (Supplementary Fig. 8 ) in the presence of BSA, which is used to exclude the possibility of nonspecific binding of heme 27 , 28 . The results demonstrated the specific binding of c -type heme, but not b -type heme, to Ssr1698 (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, we found that with an increase in the concentration of c -type heme, the Soret peak exhibits a progressive growth, reaching its maximum at a 1:2 binding stoichiometry of c -type heme to Ssr1698 (Fig. 3c ). The binding stoichiometry of c -type heme to Ssr1698 suggested that two Ssr1698 proteins as a dimer share a heme molecule (Fig. 3c ), as shown in the predicted structure (Fig. 3e ). This dimeric state of Ssr1698 was supported by the data of size-exclusion chromatogram (Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and CN-PAGE (Fig. 3d ). Considering the heme-binding property of Ssr1698 protein and its association to PBP synthesis, we hypothesize that this protein, as a potential heme oxygenase, is involved in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway for biliverdin production and subsequent PBP synthesis.

Error bars indicate the standard deviations of three independent replicates ( n = 3). d The oligomerization state of purified tag-less apo-Ssr1698 is determined by CN-PAGE. Enzyme digestion and purification of S1, S2, and S3 are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 . e A structural model represents the binding of apo-Ssr1698 with c -type heme. Apo-Ssr1698 structure was predicted by AlphaFold, and docking of its dimer with c -type heme was predicted by AutoDockVina. Full size image It has been widely accepted that heme oxygenase catalyzes the opening of the heme ring with the release of iron to form biliverdin, which is required for phycobilin production and subsequent PBP synthesis 20 . Two canonical types of b -type heme oxygenase, b HO-1 and b HO-2, have been identified in a unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as Synechocystis 6803) and preferentially cleave-free b -type heme 21 , 22 . Another common form of heme found in nature is c -type heme, which is covalently linked to proteinaceous cysteine residues 23 . In photosynthetic organisms, however, the c -type heme oxygenase ( c HO) remains a mystery. To test whether the unknown protein Ssr1698 works as a new b HO-3 or mysterious c HO, we determined the enzymatic reaction in the presence of b -type heme and c -type heme, respectively. The experimental data clearly showed that Ssr1698 lacked any observable reactivity with b -type heme (Supplementary Fig. 10 ), but had the ability to degrade the c -type heme (Fig. 4a ). Moreover, with the aid of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry and ferrozine assay analyses, the biliverdin IXα molecule, 11-amino acid peptide and free iron were identified in the reaction product catalyzed by the Ssr1698 protein with c -type heme as a substrate (Fig. 4b–f and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12 ). Collectively, we propose that the Ssr1698 protein works as a mysterious c HO and is required for biliverdin production and subsequent PBP synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the c HO in photosynthetic organisms. Fig. 4: Ssr1698 catalyzes the reaction of c -type heme to biliverdin IXα. a The degradation assay of MP-11 ( c -type heme) with Ssr1698. The decline in the characteristic Soret peak of heme at 408 nm and its shoulder peaks between 500 nm and 600 nm indicates that Ssr1698 degraded the c -type heme, a substrate for Ssr1698. b – e HPLC ( b ), MS spectra ( c , d ) and ferrozine assay ( e ) data indicate the presence of a biliverdin IXα molecule, 11-amino acid peptide and free iron in the reaction product catalyzed by Ssr1698 ( c HO) for 2 h and not for 0 h. Error bars indicate the standard deviations of three independent replicates ( n = 3). f An equation for the reaction of c -type heme to biliverdin IXα catalyzed by c HO. Full size image In cyanobacteria, the photosynthetic c HO enzyme can catalyze the cleavage of thioether bond, since we identify an 11-amino acid peptide in the reaction product catalyzed by the enzyme with c -type heme as a substrate (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. 12 ). The enzyme can also catalyze the opening of the heme ring at the α-meso position to form biliverdin IXα (Fig. 4c ). The opening is supported by the results of studies showing that the mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern of the 583.3 m / z peak of the reaction product catalyzed by the c HO enzyme with c -type heme as a substrate is consistent with that of biliverdin IXα, a standard reference sample (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). The opening is also supported by the results that the degradation of c -type heme is significantly suppressed after the addition of biliverdin IXα to the reaction system catalyzed by the c HO enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 14 ) 29 . Undoubtedly, this catalytic mechanism of cyanobacterial c HO is different from that of bacterial c HO. This difference may be caused by their different domains that cyanobacterial c HO contains DUF2470 domain (Fig. 3a ) and bacterial c HO contains β-barrel domain 23 . Dual function of the c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein during acclimation of cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations To unravel the function of c HO-dependent PBP produced during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis, the growth of Synechocystis 6803 cells was measured after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells or the nitrate was removed from the regreening cells. Consistent with the previously reported results of truncated peripheral light-harvesting antenna 30 , decreased synthesis of PBP caused by the inactivation of Ssr1698 (Fig. 2d–f ) evidently retarded the growth of Synechocystis 6803 cells under conditions of low light (Supplementary Fig. 15a ) and even growth light (Fig. 5a ), but rarely under high light (Supplementary Fig. 15b ) after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells. This confirms our expectation that the c HO-dependent PBP is involved in light-harvesting function during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis. Fig. 5: Dual function of c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein during acclimation of growth light-illuminated cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment. a , b The c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein is important for the cell growth via assembling into phycobilisome (light-harvesting function) after the nitrate is added to nitrogen-starved cells ( a ) and decomposing into nitrogen source (nitrogen-storage function) after the nitrate is removed from the culture medium ( b ). Error bars denote the standard deviations of four independent measurements ( n = 4). c , d The c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein is of great importance for the growth of cells in repeated cycles of nitrogen deprivation followed by replenishment treatments. Error bars denote the standard deviations of four independent measurements ( n = 4). Full size image Compared to the components of PSI and PSII, the synthesis of PBP has been demonstrated to be much earlier during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis (Fig. 1a, b ) 19 . Inspired by the fact that cyanophycin is synthesized under nitrogen repletion as nitrogen reservoir and is utilized under nitrogen limitation as a nitrogen source 11 , 18 , it is logical to hypothesize that the early synthesized PBP may be utilized under nitrogen deficiency as a nitrogen source. To test this hypothesis, the growth of Synechocystis 6803 cells was measured after the nitrate was removed from the regreening cells. The results indicated that decreased synthesis of PBP caused by the inactivation of Ssr1698 in regreening cells (Fig. 2d–f ) considerably retarded the growth of cells under subsequent nitrogen starvation (Fig. 5b ). Therefore, we propose that, besides the light-harvesting function, the c HO-dependent PBP is also involved in constructing nitrogen reservoir during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis and function in ensuing nitrogen-starved cells as a nitrogen source. To reveal the importance of the dual function of c HO-dependent PBP during the acclimation of cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations, we monitored the growth of wild-type (WT) Synechocystis 6803 and its ssr1698 -deletion mutant cells during repeated cycles of nitrogen deprivation followed by replenishment treatments. Compared with the WT, the inhibition degree of cell growth caused by the inactivation of Ssr1698 gradually increased with the increase in repeated cycles of nitrogen oscillation (Fig. 5c, d ), but not in repeated cycles of nitrogen repletion (Supplementary Fig. 16 ), being consistent with the results that Ssr1698 was expressed under nitrogen oscillation (preferentially during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis; Fig. 2a ) and not under nitrogen repletion. It is worthy of note that, in the third cycle of nitrogen oscillation, the inactivation of Ssr1698 has led to more than 40% decrease in the cell dry weight (Fig. 5c, d ). Collectively, we propose that the dual function of the c HO-dependent PBP is of great importance during the acclimation of cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment. The c HO homologs are geographically widespread To see whether the dual-function mechanism of the c HO-dependent PBP operates also in oceanic environment during acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-oscillation condition, the complete protein sequence of Ssr1698 was queried against the Tara Oceans database 31 . By clicking the size fractionation range of cyanobacterial cells and using stringent E values, 164 hits were obtained for cyanobacteria ( E value < 1.0 E −10 ). Ssr1698 homolog sequences were found predominantly in the surface water layer (SRF) and deep chlorophyll maximum layer (DCM) but, less abundantly, in the mesopelagic zone (MES), and were almost equally distributed among the latitudes (Supplementary Fig. 17 ). By comparison, recurrent nitrate oscillation and abundant cyanobacteria occur in the SRF and DCM but, less in the MES 32 , 33 . Collectively, we propose that the dual-function mechanism of c HO-dependent PBP is vital for acclimation of marine cyanobacteria to nitrogen-oscillation layers. Discussion The opening of the heme ring to form biliverdin IXα catalyzed by heme oxygenase is a necessary step to produce phycobilin in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway and subsequently to synthesize PBP (Supplementary Fig. S4 ) 20 . Although bacterial b HOs ChuZ and HugZ and cyanobacterial c HO share a common DUF2470 domain (Supplementary Fig. 7 ), they only have a weak sequence similarity (Supplementary Fig. 18 ), increasing the difficulty of the discovery of c HO in photosynthetic organisms. In addition, the results of previous studies and this study indicated that the b HO-1, b HO-2, and c HO genes sll1184 , sll1875 and ssr1698 were preferentially expressed under conditions of standard growth, hypoxia and regreening, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19 ) 34 , 35 , 36 . It appears plausible that the c -type heme, a substrate of c HO enzyme, released from the degradation of various c -type heme-binding proteins under nitrogen deficiency induces the expression of c HO enzyme during subsequent recovery from nitrogen chlorosis (Supplementary Fig. 19 ) 19 , 37 , 38 , 39 . This may be a reason why the photosynthetic c HO enzyme can be first identified in this study. It has been widely accepted that the PBP can be assembled into phycobilisome supercomplex as peripheral light-harvesting antenna 40 and account for up to 60% of the total soluble cell protein as nitrogen reservoir 41 . The results of this study indicated that the amount of PBP was reduced to about half the wild-type level in the c HO-deletion mutant after the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells for 12 h (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Therefore, we hypothesize that the c HO-dependent PBP is involved in light-harvesting and nitrogen reservoir functions during acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations. Our data reported here confirm our hypothesis and unravel a dual-function mechanism of c HO-dependent PBP during acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment that occurs frequently in their natural habitats. The c HO-dependent PBP produced during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis is involved in light-harvesting function during the recovery process (left, Fig. 6 ) and nitrogen reservoir function during nitrogen deficiency (right, Fig. 6 ) and as a result, in the third cycle of nitrogen oscillation, inactivation of Ssr1698 has led to more than 40% decrease in the cell dry weight (Fig. 5 ). This indicates that the c HO-dependent PBP produced during regreening is of great importance for the growth of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment. Fig. 6: A model schematically represents the dual function of c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein during the acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations. In the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway, c HO catalyzes the reaction of c -type heme to biliverdin IXα (left side, see blue arrow), which is of great importance for the synthesis, assembly and function of phycobiliprotein during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis. The c HO-dependent phycobiliprotein is important for the cell growth via assembling into phycobilisome as light-harvesting function after the nitrate is added to chlorotic cells (left side) and decomposing into nitrogen source as nitrogen-storage function after the nitrate is removed from the culture medium (right side). Full size image Over the past decade, a significant achievement has been made in identifying the working mechanisms during acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to the nitrogen-fluctuating environment 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 . Unraveling these mechanisms will certainly help deepen our understanding of the reason why cyanobacteria account for a large percentage of nitrogen storage 41 and photosynthetic CO 2 fixation on Earth 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . The results of this study indicated that the c HO-dependent PBP produced during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis is another important working mechanism of acclimating of aquatic cyanobacteria to nitrogen fluctuations. Recently, Zhang et al. 11 reported that cyanophycin also functions as a nitrogen reservoir and its defects caused by inactivation of arginine dihydrolase gene ( argZ ) retarded the growth of cyanobacterial cells during their acclimation to nitrogen fluctuations. To test whether the previously reported cyanophycin and the present c HO-dependent PBP produced during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis jointly serve as a nitrogen reservoir and provide nitrogen source in ensuing nitrogen-starved cells, we constructed a Δ ssr169 8/ argZ double-mutant strain (Supplementary Fig. 20 ). Our data indicated that the growth of the double mutant Δ ssr169 8/ argZ was much slower than that of its respective single mutants, Δ ssr169 8 and Δ argZ , in repeated cycles of nitrogen oscillation (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 20 ). This indicates that the dual function of c HO-dependent PBP is actually not redundant and is an independent working mechanism of acclimating of aquatic cyanobacteria to the nitrogen-fluctuating environment. Collectively, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify the c HO enzyme in photosynthetic organisms, which is preferentially expressed during recovery from nitrogen chlorosis and is a key step to produce phycobilin in tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway and subsequently to synthesize PBP. This enzyme-dependent PBP is further found to be vital for the growth of cyanobacterial cells during chlorosis and regreening through its nitrogen-storage and light-harvesting functions, respectively, and its dual function is proposed to be an important mechanism for acclimation of aquatic cyanobacteria to a nitrogen-fluctuating environment. Methods Culture conditions Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as Synechocystis 6803) glucose tolerant strain (the wild-type) and its mutants, Δ ssr1698 , Δ sll0253 , Δ ssl0483 , Δ sll1654 , Δ ssr1528 , Δ sll1336 ( argZ ) and Δ ssr1698 / argZ were cultured at 30 °C in BG-11 medium 42 buffered with Tris-HCl (5 mM, pH 8.0) and bubbled with 2% ( v / v ) CO 2 in air. For the growth of cells under nitrogen-deficient conditions, the concentration of nitrate in BG-11 medium was reduced from 17.6 mM to 0.35 mM. For the recovery of cells from nitrogen chlorosis, the nitrate was added to nitrogen-starved cultures to a final concentration of 17.6 mM. Continuous illumination was provided by fluorescence lamps at 5, 40, or 200 µmol photons m –2 s –1 . The mutant strains were routinely grown in the presence of appropriate antibiotics. Transcriptomic sequencing and bioinformatics analysis The nitrate was added to chlorotic cells of wild-type Synechocystis 6803 for 4 h or not and total RNA was extracted using the mirVana miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA integrity was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and samples with an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than 7 were used for subsequent analysis. The libraries were constructed using TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-Zero Gold according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and transcriptome sequencing was performed using the Illumina sequencing platform by Shanghai OE Biotech. Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with DESeq, using P value < 0.05 and fold change > 4 or < −4 as the thresholds. Cluster analysis of DEGs was performed according to the gene function annotation from CyanoBase ( http://genome.microbedb.jp/cyanobase/ ). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis Total RNA used for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis was derived from the chlorotic cells of wild-type Synechocystis 6803 that were added by nitrate for 4 h or not. Extracted total RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using PrimeScript TM RT reagent Kit (Perfect Real Time) (TAKARA, Otsu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and the cDNA was amplified with the SYBR Green Real-Time PCR assay kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The transcript levels of cpcA , apcA , cpcG1 , cpcG2 , apcE , apcF , and ndhI (internal standard) were measured by RT-qPCR in triplicates using the 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the primers shown in Supplementary Table 1 . Construction of mutants The mutant strains of the top five upregulated unknown genes in our transcriptomic data were constructed as follows. The upstream and downstream regions of ssr1698 , sll0253 , ssl0483 , sll1654 , or ssr1528 were amplified by PCR, creating appropriate restriction sites. A DNA fragment encoding a Kam R cassette was also amplified by PCR, creating the Kpn I and Sac I sites using appropriate PCR primers (Supplementary Table 1 ). These three PCR products were ligated into the MCS of pUC19 (Supplementary Fig. 5b ) and used to transform the wild-type cells of Synechocystis 6803 to generate the Δ ssr1698 , Δ sll0253 , Δ ssl0483 , Δ sll1654 or Δ ssr1528 mutant, respectively. Subsequently, these transformants were spread on agar plates containing BG-11 medium and kanamycin (10 µg mL –1 ) buffered at pH 8.0, and the plates were incubated in 2% ( v / v ) CO 2 in air under illumination by fluorescent lamps at 40 µmol photons m –2 s –1 . The mutated ssr1698 , sll0253 , ssl0483 , sll1654 , or ssr1528 in the transformants was segregated to homogeneity (by successive streak purification) as determined by PCR amplification (Supplementary Fig. 5c ). The Δ argZ and Δ ssr1698 / argZ mutants were constructed as follows. The upstream and downstream regions of argZ were amplified by PCR, creating appropriate restriction sites. A DNA fragment encoding a Sp R cassette was also amplified by PCR, creating the Kpn I and Sac I sites using appropriate PCR primers (Supplementary Table 1 ). They were ligated into the MCS of pUC19 to generate the pUC19-Δ argZ plastid. The pUC19-Δ argZ plastid was transformed into wild-type Synechocystis 6803 and its mutant Δ ssr1698 to obtain Δ argZ and Δ ssr1698 / argZ , respectively. Isolation of crude thylakoid membranes The cell cultures (800 mL) were harvested at different time points that the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells of wild-type Synechocystis 6803 or not, and the thylakoid membranes were isolated according to ref. 43 with some modifications as follows. The cells suspended in 5 mL of disruption buffer (10 mM HEPES-NaOH, 5 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM NaCl, and 25% [ v / v ] glycerol) were supplemented by zirconia/silica beads and broken by vortexing 15 times at the highest speed for 20 s at 4 °C with 5 min cooling on ice between the runs. The crude extract was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min to remove the glass beads and unbroken cells. By further centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min, we obtained crude thylakoid membranes from the precipitation. Electrophoresis and immunoblotting Blue native-PAGE (BN-PAGE) of Synechocystis 6803 membranes was performed as described previously 44 with slight modifications 45 , 46 , 47 , 48 , 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 . Isolated membranes were prepared for BN-PAGE as follows. Membranes were washed with 330 mM sorbitol, 50 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and resuspended in 20% ( w / v ) glycerol, 25 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1 units of RNase-free DNase RQ1 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at a chlorophyll a concentration corresponding to 2 × 10 9 cells, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min, and an equal volume of 3% n -dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DM) was added. Solubilization was performed for 40 min on ice. Insoluble components were removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The collected supernatant was mixed with a one-tenth volume of sample buffer, 5% Serva Blue G, 100 mM Bis-Tris, pH 7, 30% ( w / v ) Sucrose, 500 mM ε -amino- n -caproic acid, and 10 mM EDTA. Solubilized membranes were then applied to a 0.75-mm-thick, 5% to 12.5% acrylamide gradient gel (Hoefer Mighty Small mini-vertical unit, Hoefer, San Francisco, CA, USA). Samples were loaded on an equal cell number basis per lane. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C by increasing the voltage gradually from 50 up to 200 V during the 5.5-h run. Clear native-PAGE (CN-PAGE) was used to detect the oligomerization of the purified tag-less Ssr1698 and was performed with 0.01% DM and 0.025% deoxycholate additives to the cathode buffer as described previously 53 with slight modifications 54 , 55 . The purified tag-less Ssr1698 were applied to a 0.75-mm-thick, 5–12.5% acrylamide gradient gel (Hoefer). Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C by increasing the voltage gradually from 50 up to 200 V during the 5.5-h run. SDS-PAGE of Synechocystis 6803 total proteins was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gel with 6 M urea as described previously 56 . After electrophoresis, the proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (CBB) staining. For immunoblotting, the proteins were electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA) and detected by protein-specific antibodies using an ECL assay kit (Amersham, Arlington Heights, IL, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Antibodies against CpcA (1:1000), ApcA (1:000), PsbO (1:1000), PsaD (1:1000), and NdhI (1:2000) were raised previously in our laboratory 48 , 57 . Antibodies against PsaB (1:5000) and D1 (1:5000) were purchased from Agrisera (Vännäs, Sweden). Phycobilisome isolation The phycobilisome was isolated according to the method of Glazer 58 with some modifications. The wild-type Synechocystis 6803 and its mutant Δ ssr1698 cells were harvested at different time points that the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells or not, and washed twice in 0.75 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6). Subsequently, cells were resuspended in the same buffer and broken at 4 °C by a high-pressure homogenizer (PhD Technology LLC, Saint Paul, MN, USA) for three cycles at a pressure of 5000 psi. The crude extract was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove the unbroken cells and debris. Triton X-100 was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 2% ( v / v ) to release the phycobilisome from the thylakoid membranes. After 30 min of incubation (4 °C) at constant shaking, the thylakoids and debris were removed by centrifugation (20,000 × g , 30 min). The supernatant was loaded onto a linear (5–30%) sucrose density gradient in 0.75 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) for ultracentrifugation at 110,000 × g for 16 h in a P40ST rotor (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). A linear sucrose gradient was prepared from 5.2 mL of 5% and 5.2 mL of 30% sucrose solutions in 0.75 M K-phosphate buffer using a gradient mixer (Hoefer). After the ultracentrifugation, the gathered narrow blue-colored zone was collected for further analysis. Expression and purification of fusion proteins The fragment containing ssr1698 gene was amplified by PCR and inserted between the Bam HI and Xho I sites of pGEX-5X-1 to form the GST-tagged fusion protein construct (primers are shown in Supplementary Table 1 ). Subsequently, the construct was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS and induced by 0.2 mM isopropyl-β- d -thiogalactoside for 12 h at 16 °C to express GST-Ssr1698 fusion protein. The fusion protein was purified at 4 °C using a GST column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Then size-exclusion chromatography with the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300GL column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) was used for further purification and the peak fraction containing GST-Ssr1698 was collected and concentrated. Finally, the tag-less Ssr1698 was purified by size-exclusion chromatography equilibrated with PBS buffer (pH 7.4) after the GST-tag was removed by Factor Xa protease (NEB, Beverley, MA, USA). Heme titration assays The heme-binding ability of tag-less Ssr1698 was estimated by optical titrations in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) as described previously 27 , 28 using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (UV3000, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at room temperature. To exclude the possibility of nonspecific binding of heme, the binding reactions were conducted in the presence of 20 µM BSA. For the c -type heme-binding assay, MP-11 in 1 µM increments was added to both the sample and the reference cuvettes, the former of which contained 10 µM tag-less Ssr1698 and 20 µM BSA, and the latter of which contained 20 µM BSA and not tag-less Ssr1698. For the b -type heme-binding assay, hemin in 2 µM increments was added to both the sample and the reference cuvettes, the former of which contained 20 µM tag-less Ssr1698 and 20 µM BSA, and the latter of which contained 20 µM BSA and not tag-less Ssr1698. The difference absorption spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the reference cuvette from that of sample cuvette. Heme oxygenase activity assays The c -type heme oxygenase activity of Ssr1698 was examined by incubating either 10.8 µM Ssr1698 (enzyme) and 5.4 µM MP-11 (a substrate for c -type heme oxygenase) or 20 µM Ssr1698 (enzyme) and 10 µM hemin (a substrate for b -type heme oxygenase) with 10 mM ascorbic acid and 2 µM catalase in a cuvette containing PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was initiated by addition of sodium ascorbate and UV–visible absorption spectra was recorded every 30 min for 2 h using a UV3000 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Products of reaction catalyzed by Ssr1698 were analyzed as follows. (1) Biliverdin IXα was detected by the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using Agilent 1290UPLC/6550Q-TOF. 5 µL of the reaction products was applied to the ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) with a 300 µL/min flow rate of mobile phase solvent A (0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (methanol) using the following linear gradient: 5–40% solvent B for 3 min, 40–95% solvent B for 10 min, 95% solvent B for 4 min, 95–5% solvent B for 1 min, and 5% solvent B for 3 min. The LC-MS was recorded over a range of m / z 100–2000 units. The following parameters were used: the capillary voltage 4.0 kV for positive-ion mode; desolvation temperature 350 °C; desolvation gas 12 L/min. (2) Peptide was detected by Shanghai Luming Biological Technology Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China) using Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. The scanning range of parent ions was corrected by standard correction fluid at 300–1600 m / z , and the scanning mode of mass spectrometry was data-dependent acquisition (DDA). The 20 strongest fragment profiles (MS2 Scan) are collected after each full scan. Fragmentation was performed using high-energy collision dissociation (HCD, high energy) with an NCE energy of 28 and dynamic removal time of 25 s. The resolution of MS1 was 70000 at m / z 200, the AGC target was 3E6, and the maximum injection time was 100 ms. The resolution of MS2 was 17500, the AGC target was 1E5, and the maximum injection time was 50 ms. (3) Detection of free iron was performed as described previously 23 , 59 . 2.8 µM Ssr1698 was incubated with 10 mM ascorbic acid, 0–6 µM MP-11, 2 µM catalase, and 40 µL ferrozine reagent B (2 M ascorbic acid, 5 M ammonium acetate, 6.5 mM ferrozine, 13.1 mM neocuproine) in a cuvette containing a total of 400 µL of PBS buffer (pH 7.4). A control reaction was also performed without Ssr1698. The reactions were monitored at 562 nm using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). The dependence of the initial rate of the c -type heme oxygenase reaction on the concentration of enzyme was determined by incubating 9 µM MP-11, 10 mM sodium ascorbate, 2 µM catalase, and 0–5 µM Ssr1698 in a cuvette containing PBS buffer (pH 7.4). The reactions were monitored at 406 nm and were performed in triplicate using Shimadzu UV3000 UV–visible spectrophotometer. The reaction velocity was calculated as the MP-11 consumption per minute. Chlorophyll fluorescence and P700 analysis Synechocystis 6803 cells were harvested at different time points that the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells or not, and the activities of their photosystem II (PSII) and PSI reaction centers were estimated by the F v / F m and P m parameters, respectively. These two parameters were measured as follows. The yield of chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence at the steady state of electron transport was measured using a Dual-PAM-100 monitoring system (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) equipped with an ED-101US/MD unit 60 , 61 . Minimal fluorescence corresponding to open PSII centers in the dark-adapted state ( F o ) was excited by a weak measuring light (650 nm) at a PFD of 0.05–0.15 µmol photons m –2 s –1 . A saturation pulse of red light (100 ms; 10,000 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ) was applied to determine the maximal fluorescence at closed PSII centers in the dark-adapted state ( F m ), as described previously 62 . F v / F m was calculated as ( F m − F o )/ F m 63 . With the Dual-PAM-100, P700 + was monitored as the absorption difference between 830 and 875 nm in transmission mode. The quantum yields of PSI were determined using the saturation pulse method as described previously 64 , 65 . The level of maximal P700 + signal observed upon full oxidation, P m , was determined by the application of a saturation pulse of red light (100 ms; 10,000 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ) in the presence of far-red light (about 0.3 µmol photons m −2 s −1 ) at 720 nm. 77K fluorescence emission spectra Fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K of phycobilisome isolated from the wild-type Synechocystis 6803 and its mutant Δ ssr1698 that the nitrate was added to chlorotic cells or not for different time points were measured using a F 4500 spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi) at an excitation wavelength of 580 nm. Fifty nanograms of isolated phycobilisome samples was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen. The fluorescence spectrum was obtained by averaging six scans for each sample in different tubes. The excitation and emission slit widths were set at 5 nm, and the same capture was used in all experiments. The phycobilisome activity was assessed by the ratio of fluorescence emission intensity at 683 nm (from the core component of phycobilisome) to that at 654 nm (from the rod component of phycobilisome) 66 . Dry weight Dry weight (DW) of wild-type Synechocystis 6803 and its mutants during nitrogen oscillation or nitrogen repletion was measured according to the method of ref. 67 with some modifications. First of all, the cell cultures (10 mL) were harvested and washed twice with deionized water. Second, cells were resuspended in 100 µL deionized water and dropped on a pre-weighed polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (0.45 µm; Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). Finally, the cell-bound PVDF membrane was evaporated at 65 °C for about 24 h, and the oven-dried membrane was weighed. DW was calculated according to the formula: DW (g L −1 culture) = (oven-dried cell-bound PVDF membrane – PVDF membrane) × 100. Homology modeling of protein structure and molecular docking The protein structure of Ssr1698 was modeled by AlphaFold 68 . The structure of Ssr1698 dimer was predicted by ClusPro server 69 . Docking was performed using AutoDockVina 70 . The structure of dimeric Ssr1698 in complex with c -type heme was visualized using ChimeraX 71 and PyMOL 72 . Homolog sequence of Ssr1698 in Tara Oceans Database The Ssr1698 protein sequence was queried against the Ocean Gene Atlas webserver ( http://tara-oceans.mio.osupytheas.fr/ocean-gene-atlas/ ) using the Tara Oceans Microbiome Reference Gene Catalog version 1 (OM-RGC.v1) to search for cyanobacterial homologs 31 via clicking the size fractionation range of cyanobacterial cells 73 . Threshold E values are given in the main text.

(Courtesy of Lorraine Backer/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public health image library) Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials are urging the public to avoid drinking and direct contact with the water at the popular Hells Canyon Reservoir and Brownlee Reservoir areas due to harmful algal blooms. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare issued the health advisories after water samples from both areas came back with high amounts of toxin-producing cyanobacteria, department officials announced in a press release issued Thursday. Summer heat can cause dangerous conditions, harmful algal blooms in Idaho’s rivers and lakes Hells Canyon Reservoir is located in Adams County, and Brownlee Canyon is located in Washington County. Both flow into the Snake River and are popular fishing spots. Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials are urging people to stay out of the water, keep their pets and livestock away from the water and avoid drinking and cooking with the water. Symptoms in people include a rash, hives, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, wheezing and red eyes. Health officials warned that animals and pets can become very sick and die within minutes to days of exposure to cyanotoxins. If pets or animals come in contact with water from a harmful bloom, the animal should be washed with clean water immediately and prevented from licking cyanobacteria off their body or fur. If an animal is exposed to cyanobacteria and starts to appear sick, health officials urge the public to seek veterinary care immediately. The algal blooms may look like surface scum, foam, spilled paint, foam or a mat. Health officials said cyanobacteria are a natural part of Idaho’s waters, but the amount of bacteria increases when water temperatures rise and there are nutrients for the bacteria to bloom. Additional information is available online. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said it will advise the public when the harmful conditions likely no longer exist. SUPPORT NEWS YOU TRUST.

Visitors should not swim or water ski in Lincoln Beach, Provo Bay, American Fork Marina,  Lindon Marina, or any of the areas surrounding these spots. Boaters should avoid areas of algae.  The DEQ advises against drinking the lake water. And pet owners should keep animals away from the water. Knowing how to recognize the blue-green algae blooms can help visitors stay safe and healthy, said the Department of Environmental Quality. Other areas of Utah Lake are safe, according to the Department of Environmental Quality website . Ingesting water or fish tainted with cyanobacteria The substance discovered by officials is cyanobacteria , which is sometimes called blue-green or harmful algae. Cyanobacteria live naturally in every body of water, worldwide,, according to the Department of Environmental Quality. The bacteria only become harmful when they multiply quickly. The quick growth of colonies can sometimes produce toxins, said the Department of Environmental Quality. Ingesting water that contains cyanobacteria can cause illness in humans, pets, and livestock. The toxins produced by cyanobacteria can cause kidney and liver damage, or neurological problems. If a visitor ingests water from the lake, contact Utah Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222. If visitors catch fish from the water, the Department of Environmental Quality said to clean them well and discard the guts.

Bacteria were the first organisms to photosynthesize, creating the oxygen essential for the evolution of life on Earth. Philipp Schulze / picture alliance via Getty Images Nearly all animals need to breathe oxygen to survive. The life-sustaining gas they inhale is made by plants, algae and cyanobacteria during photosynthesis. In a new study published Wednesday in the journal Nature , researchers have found cyanobacteria fossils from around 1.75 billion years ago that seem to have had the tools to make oxygen. They contain thylakoid membranes , structures in which photosynthesis takes place. The find marks the earliest fossil evidence of photosynthesis. “This discovery extends the fossil record of such internal membranes by at least 1.2 billion years,” study co-author Emmanuelle Javaux , a biologist at the University of Liège in Belgium, tells Gizmodo ’s Isaac Schultz. Indirect evidence from genetics and chemical studies had previously suggested that cyanobacteria had thylakoids by this time. But exactly when the photosynthesizing structures first evolved remained unclear, Kevin Boyce , a paleobotanist at Stanford University who was not involved in the work, tells New Scientist ’s Grace Wade. The new study, he adds, indicates that this occurred at least 1.75 billion years ago. “Any evidence that you have from that time period is important, because the fossil record is really very sparse,” Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo , an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England who did not contribute to the findings, tells Science News ’ Tina Hesman Saey. The first life on Earth didn’t require oxygen to survive. During the planet’s early days, the atmosphere was mostly made of carbon dioxide, methane and water vapor , instead of the nitrogen and oxygen that dominate today. But around 2.45 billion years ago, the Great Oxidation Event occurred, during which the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere rose suddenly. The first oxygen-producing cyanobacteria are thought to have evolved two to three billion years ago . Scientists understood this through other lines of evidence, such as geochemical signatures, but before this week’s study, the earliest fossils of cyanobacteria with thylakoids were only around 500 million years old. For the new study, researchers looked at cyanobacteria fossils from Australia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Canadian Arctic. They sliced the fossils into slivers much thinner than a sheet of paper and studied their makeup with an electron microscope. Observing the arrangement of structures in the cells was “unambiguous,” Javaux tells Gizmodo —it resembled the hardware for photosynthesis. Scientists found evidence of thylakoids in the Australian fossils, which date to between 1.73 and 1.78 billion years ago, as well as the Canadian fossils, which are 900 million to 1.01 billion years old. The fossils from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which were about one billion years old, did not have signs of thylakoid membranes, per Ars Technica ’s John Timmer. “This is the kind of information that I thought we were not going to be able to pull out of fossils,” Woodward Fischer , a geobiologist at Caltech who did not contribute to the findings, tells Science News . The paper shows the importance of studying the fossil record to determine the early evolution of cyanobacteria, per the study. Researchers are still trying to determine when cyanobacteria with thylakoid membranes split evolutionarily from those without—it is thought to have occurred between 2 billion and 2.7 billion years ago. “If we are interested in the early version of our planet and life, these cyanobacteria are very important microorganisms, because they are the one who invented this oxygenic photosynthesis,” Javaux tells Courthouse News ’ Hillel Aron. “This changed, completely, the chemistry of Earth over the years.” Get the latest stories in your inbox every weekday.

Glycogen deficiency causes the extracellular release of distinctive metabolites such as pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate upon nitrogen depletion; however, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of carbon partitioning in glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria. Extracellular and intracellular metabolites in a glycogen-deficient Δ glgC mutant of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were comprehensively analyzed. In the presence of a nitrogen source, the Δ glgC mutant released extracellular glutamate rather than pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its intracellular glutamate level was lower than that in the wild-type strain. The de novo synthesis of glutamate increased in the Δ glgC mutant, suggesting that glycogen deficiency enhanced carbon partitioning into glutamate and extracellular excretion through an unidentified transport system. This study proposes a model in which glutamate serves as the prime extracellular metabolic sink alternative to glycogen when nitrogen is available.

In cyanobacteria, glycogen synthesis and accumulation are induced by unfavorable environments, including depletion of nitrogen, phosphorus, and iron 2 and oxidative stress 3 . Starting from glucose 1-phosphate (G1P), cyanobacteria synthesize glycogen using enzymes including ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (also referred to as G1P adenylyl transferase) (GlgC), glycogen synthases (GlgA1/GlgA2), and 1,4-α-glucan branching enzyme (GlgB) 1 , 4 . In several cyanobacteria, such as Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (PCC 6803), Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (PCC 7942), and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (PCC 7002), glycogen synthesis and accumulation were completely abolished by either single inactivation of the glgC gene or simultaneous inactivation of the glgA1 / glgA2 genes 5 , 6 , 7 . Although glycogen-deficient mutants are sensitive to several adverse conditions, such as high light, light-dark regimes, low inocula, and nitrogen starvation, and show reduced photosynthetic capacity and a non-bleaching phenotype upon nitrogen depletion 8 , 9 , 10 , they can still grow photoautotrophically by fixing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Cyanobacteria can directly convert CO 2 into valuable compounds using sunlight as an energy source and have been studied as sustainable producers of various biochemicals 11 . Blocking glycogen synthesis has been considered as a promising general approach for improving carbon partitioning into the desired compounds. For example, glycogen deficiency caused by the inactivation of both glgA1 and glgA2 genes increased the yield of mannitol in PCC 7002 12 . In PCC 6803, ethanol production was improved by the deletion of glgC , particularly when the cells were cultured without nitrogen 13 . Strengthening glycogen degradation activity also improved the production titer; overexpression of glycogen phosphorylase GlgP, which degrades glycogen into G1P, decreased glycogen accumulation and increased the secretory production of sucrose in PCC 7942 14 . These reports indicate that modification of glycogen synthesis and degradation has a large impact on carbon metabolism in cyanobacteria. The extracellular release of distinctive metabolites in glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle upon nitrogen depletion is a noteworthy feature of glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria. This metabolic phenomenon occurs because they partition fixed carbon into glycolysis and the TCA cycle, in addition to converting it into alternative storage compounds, such as glucosylglycerol and sucrose, in the glgA1/A2 mutant 15 . For example, the Δ glgC mutant of PCC 7942 exhibited higher intracellular levels of 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), citrate (Cit), succinate (Suc), and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) than the wild type and excreted pyruvate (Pyr), Suc, fumarate (Fum), and 2-OG 9 , 16 . In glycogen-deficient mutants of PCC 6803, Pyr and 2-OG overflow extracellularly in a light-dependent manner 8 , 17 . In PCC 7002, the extracellular release of Pyr, Suc, acetate, 2-OG, and α-ketoisocaproate is increased in the Δ glgC mutant 10 , 18 . Thus, the extracellular release of glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites, especially Pyr and 2-OG, is a common phenotype of glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria upon nitrogen depletion and light illumination. In addition, the glycogen-deficient mutant exhibited a high energy charge under high-light conditions, suggesting that glycogen synthesis functions as an energy buffer in cyanobacteria 19 . Therefore, the extracellular release of metabolites has been suggested as an alternative dissipation mechanism for excess energy in glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria when photosynthetic carbon fixation exceeds biomass accumulation. However, the reasons for the release of glycolytic and TCA cycle metabolites have not been fully elucidated. In addition, how nitrogen depletion is involved in the metabolite release remains unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the carbon-partitioning mechanism of glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria by investigating the extracellular and intracellular metabolic consequences. To examine why the release of Pyr and 2-OG occurs only under nitrogen-depleted conditions, metabolomic analysis was performed on the Δ glgC mutant of PCC 7942 cultured in the presence of a nitrogen source. High levels of glutamate (Glu), rather than Pyr or 2-OG, were found to be extracellularly released in the presence of a nitrogen source. In addition, the de novo synthesis of Glu increased in the Δ glgC mutant in the presence of a nitrogen source. Thus, it was suggested that, when a nitrogen source is available, glycogen deficiency enhances carbon partitioning into Glu, which serves as the prime extracellular metabolic sink alternative to glycogen. Results Metabolites extracellularly released from the glycogen-deficient cells To investigate the metabolic consequences of glycogen-deficiency in the absence and presence of a nitrogen source, a Δ glgC mutant strain of PCC 7942 was cultured using the BG-11 medium with initial nitrate concentrations of 7.5 mM (low nitrogen, LN) and 17.6 mM (high nitrogen, HN; the standard nitrate concentration of BG-11 medium). The nitrate concentration in the culture medium was analyzed, and under LN conditions, PCC 7942 (wild type) and the Δ glgC mutant completely consumed nitrate on days 2 and 5, respectively (Fig. 1a ), showing that these strains were in nitrogen depletion after day 5. Under HN conditions, in contrast, nitrate in the medium remained available at day 10, indicating that these strains were in nitrogen repletion during cultivation. The phosphate concentrations in the culture medium were also analyzed, and it was discovered that these strains completely consumed phosphate by day 3 under both LN and HN conditions (Fig. 1b ). The Δ glgC mutant exhibited significantly lower biomass accumulation than did the wild type under LN and HN conditions (Fig. 1c ). Under LN conditions, the biomass accumulation of the Δ glgC mutant at day 10 was 0.86 g-dry cell weight (DCW)·L −1 , which was 43.2% of that of the wild type (1.98 g-DCW·L − 1 ). Similarly, under HN conditions, the biomass accumulation of the Δ glgC mutant at day 10 was 1.59 g-DCW·L −1 , which was 52.9% of that of the wild type (3.01 g-DCW·L −1 ). The glycogen content in the wild-type biomass started to increase from day 3 under both nitrogen conditions (Fig. 1d ). During the 10-day cultivation, the glycogen content of the wild-type cells reached 47.4% of DCW under LN conditions and 35.2% of DCW under HN conditions. In contrast, no glycogen was detected in the Δ glgC mutant cells under either nitrogen condition. The significantly lower biomass accumulation in the Δ glgC mutant than in the wild type would be caused by deficiency of glycogen, which is the major biomass component in PCC 7942, as well as the extracellular release of metabolites, as previously reported 9 , 16 . Fig. 1: Evaluation of the Δ glgC mutant cyanobacteria for nitrate consumption, phosphate consumption, biomass accumulation, and glycogen accumulation. The wild-type (blue circles) and Δ glgC mutant (orange squares) cyanobacteria were cultured using media with an initial nitrate concentration of 7.5 mM (low nitrogen, LN) and 17.6 mM (high nitrogen, HN). Subsequently, nitrate concentration in medium ( a ), phosphate concentration in medium ( b ), dry cell weight (DCW)-based biomass accumulation ( c ), and cellular glycogen content ( d ) were analyzed. Values are shown as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate experiments (* P < 0.05 by Welch’s t test). Full size image To investigate the extracellularly released metabolites under these nitrogen conditions, the metabolites in the culture supernatant were comprehensively analyzed. Under LN conditions, the Δ glgC mutant released high amounts (more than 10 mg·﻿L −1 at day 10) of the metabolites involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle (i.e., Pyr, 2-OG, and Suc) into the medium (Fig. 2a ). The release of 2-OG and Suc was consistent with a previous report on the Δ glgC mutant of PCC 7942 9 . Additionally, the release of Pyr and 2-OG has been reported on the Δ glgA1 / glgA2 mutant and Δ glgC mutant in PCC 6803 8 , 17 , 20 , and release of 2-OG, Pyr, and Suc has been reported on the Δ glgC mutant in PCC 7002 18 , indicating that this phenomenon is not specific to PCC 7942. In the present study, the Δ glgC mutant cells particularly released Pyr (41.91 mg·L −1 at day 10) and 2-OG (506.27 mg·L −1 at day 10), which were more than 100-fold higher than those of the wild type. The Δ glgC mutant also released more lactate (Lac) than the wild type under both nitrogen conditions. Under HN conditions, in contrast, the Δ glgC mutant released 3.76 mg·L −1 Pyr and 9.88 mg·﻿L −1 2-OG, which was significantly lower than that under LN conditions. Instead of these metabolites in glycolysis and the TCA cycle, the Δ glgC mutant released high amounts of several proteinogenic amino acids (i.e., alanine and glutamate) under HN conditions (Fig. 2b ). In particular, the Δ glgC mutant released Glu at 81.44 mg·﻿L −1 after 10 days of cultivation. Thus, in the presence of a nitrogen source, glycogen deficiency caused the extracellular release of Glu rather than Pyr or 2-OG. Fig. 2: Analysis of extracellularly released metabolites from the Δ glgC mutant cyanobacteria. The wild-type (blue circles) and Δ glgC mutant (orange squares) cyanobacteria were cultured using media with the initial nitrate concentration of 7.5 mM (low nitrogen, LN) and 17.6 mM (high nitrogen, HN). Subsequently, extracellularly released metabolites in glycolysis and the TCA cycle ( a ) and proteinogenic amino acids ( b ) were analyzed. Pyr pyruvate, Lac lactate, 2-OG 2-oxoglutarate, Suc succinate, Fum fumarate, Mal malate, Ala alanine, Arg arginine, Asn asparagine, Asp aspartate, Cys cysteine, Gln glutamine, Glu glutamate, Gly glycine, His histidine, Ile isoleucine, Leu leucine, Lys lysine, Met methionine, Phe phenylalanine, Pro proline, Ser serine, Thr threonine, Trp tryptophan, Tyr tyrosine, Val valine. Values are shown as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate experiments (* P < 0.05 by Welch’s t test). Full size image Levels of intracellular metabolites in the glycogen-deficient cells To elucidate the mechanism of metabolite release in the Δ glgC mutant, the intracellular metabolite levels were comprehensively analyzed. Regarding the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle, the Δ glgC mutant showed an increased accumulation of 3-PGA, whereas the levels of sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) and ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) decreased under LN conditions after nitrogen depletion on day 2 (Fig. 3a ). This suggested that the conversion of 3-PGA into the intermediates in the CBB cycle decreased in the Δ glgC mutant. In addition, the Δ glgC mutant showed a decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels on days 5 and 7 under LN conditions together with significantly lower levels of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) compared to the wild type under both nitrogen conditions. The levels of 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PGA) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in the Δ glgC mutant were lower than those in the wild type under both LN and HN conditions, suggesting that carbon partitioning from these metabolites was enhanced toward downstream metabolites in the mutant. The levels of Lac in the Δ glgC mutant cells were also lower than in the wild type under both LN and HN conditions. Because the extracellular levels of Lac were higher in the Δ glgC mutant compared to those in the wild type (Fig. 2a ), it is possible that the extracellular release of Lac was activated in the mutant. The extracellularly released metabolites other than Lac in the Δ glgC mutant, i.e., Pyr, 2-OG, Suc, and Mal, accumulated intracellularly under LN conditions (Fig. 3b ). This result is mostly consistent with that of a previous study reporting that intracellular levels of 3-PGA, Cit, Suc, and 2-OG increased in the Δ glgC mutant of PCC 7942 upon nitrogen starvation 9 . Since the intracellular levels of 2-OG, Suc, Mal, and Pyr were higher and the level of acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) was lower than that in the wild type after day 5 under LN conditions, conversion of Pyr into AcCoA might be the rate-limiting step in the Δ glgC mutant (Fig. 3b ). Under HN conditions, the intracellular accumulation of Pyr, 2-OG, Suc, and Mal was not significantly different between the wild type and Δ glgC mutant, compared to that under LN conditions. The intracellular level of Glu significantly decreased in the Δ glgC mutant under both nitrogen conditions. As the extracellular level of Glu was significantly higher in the Δ glgC mutant than in the wild type (Fig. 2b ), an export mechanism for Glu was suggested to be activated in the mutant. Fig. 3: Analysis of intracellular metabolites in the Δ glgC mutant cyanobacteria. The wild-type (blue circles) and Δ glgC mutant (orange squares) cyanobacteria were cultured using media with initial nitrate concentrations of 7.5 mM (low nitrogen, LN) and 17.6 mM (high nitrogen, HN); then, the intracellular metabolites were comprehensively analyzed.

Error bars indicate standard deviation of three replicate experiments (* P < 0.05 by Welch’s t test). Full size image Analysis of newly synthesized metabolites from CO 2 As the Δ glgC mutant extracellularly released Pyr, 2-OG, and Glu more than the wild type (Fig. 2 a, b), it was hypothesized that the de novo synthesis ratio of these metabolites would increase in the mutant. To test this hypothesis, metabolites newly synthesized by carbon fixation were analyzed using dynamic metabolic analysis. Newly synthesized metabolites were labeled with 13 C by adding NaH 13 CO 3 to the culture medium on day 5 when the nitrate in the medium was completely depleted under LN conditions (Fig. 1a ). Subsequently, the time course changes in the labeling ratio of the intracellular metabolites were analyzed. However, Pyr data were not obtained because of the low signal abundance. Compared to that in the wild type, the labeling ratio of 3-PGA in the Δ glgC mutant remained unchanged and decreased under LN and HN conditions, respectively (Fig. 4 ). This suggests that glycogen deficiency causes a decrease in carbon fixation under nitrogen-replete conditions but not under nitrogen-depleted conditions. During glycolysis, the labeling ratio of 2-PGA under LN conditions increased in the Δ glgC mutant. Under HN conditions, the labeling ratio of 2-PGA did not change in the Δ glgC mutant, whereas that of the upstream metabolite 3-PGA decreased. In addition, the labeling ratio of PEP increased in the Δ glgC mutant under both LN and HN conditions. These results suggest that carbon partitioning into glycolysis is enhanced by glycogen deficiency independent of nitrogen availability. In the Δ glgC mutant, the labeling ratio of 2-OG significantly increased under both LN and HN conditions. Furthermore, the labeling ratios of Glu and glutamine (Gln) increased independent of nitrogen conditions. Compared with those under HN conditions, 13 C fractions of Glu and Gln in the Δ glgC mutant rapidly increased under LN conditions, possibly because of low intracellular levels. The intracellular levels of 2-OG, Glu, and Gln during the 13 C-labeling experiment were also analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 1a ), and found to be consistent with the result shown in Fig. 3b . Based on these data, the levels of newly synthesized and intracellularly accumulated metabolites were calculated. The intracellular levels of 13 C-labeled 2-OG and 13 C-labeled Glu were significantly higher in the Δ glgC mutant than they were in the wild type under LN and HN conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1b ). These results suggest that glycogen deficiency enhances the partitioning of newly fixed carbon into the TCA cycle, or further into the Gln synthase (GS)-Glu synthase (GOGAT) cycle when a nitrogen source is available. Fig. 4: Time course of 13 C labeling of the newly synthesized metabolites. The wild-type (blue circles) and Δ glgC mutant (orange squares) cyanobacteria were cultured using media with initial nitrate concentrations of 7.5 mM (low nitrogen, LN) and 17.6 mM (high nitrogen, HN) for 5 days. Subsequently, 25 mM NaH 13 CO 3 was added to the culture medium as a carbon source. After 0 to 12 h cultivation, intracellular metabolites were analyzed, and the ratio of 13 C in the total carbon ( 13 C fraction) was determined.

Full size image Discussion Glycogen synthesis functions as a metabolic sink in cyanobacteria when the amount of photosynthetically fixed carbon exceeds the amount used for cellular maintenance and growth. In glycogen-deficient mutant cyanobacteria, metabolites such as Pyr and 2-OG are released extracellularly upon nitrogen depletion and serve as alternative sinks for excess light energy 8 , 9 , 10 , 16 , 17 , 18 . The present study investigated the metabolic consequence of glycogen deficiency under nitrogen-depleted and -repleted conditions by culturing the glycogen-deficient Δ glgC mutant in PCC 7942 under LN and HN conditions, respectively. Under LN conditions, the wild type and Δ glgC mutant were considered nitrogen-depleted after day 5 because they had completely consumed the nitrate in the medium by that timepoint. Under HN conditions, these strains were considered to be in nitrogen repletion throughout the cultivation since the nitrate in the medium remained available even on day 10. In addition, under HN conditions, the wild-type cells accumulated glycogen, even though the nitrogen source was not depleted (Fig. 1 a, d). Since phosphate in the culture medium was completely depleted by day 3 (Fig. 1b ), the glycogen accumulation under HN conditions was suggested to be induced by phosphorus depletion 2 . The glycogen accumulation in wild-type cells might be also enhanced by high CO 2 (1%) conditions since cyanobacterial glycogen content was reported to be increased under 1%, 2%, and 4% CO 2 compared to that under 0.04% CO 2 conditions 21 . The present study showed that the glycogen-deficient Δ glgC mutant in PCC 7942 releases Glu extracellularly rather than Pyr and 2-OG when nitrogen is available (Fig. 2 ). Since Glu is an abundant metabolite in cells (Fig. 3 ), cell lysis during cultivation or cell disruption when preparing extracellular supernatants via centrifugation might occur in the Δ glgC mutant. Intracellular metabolites were detected in the Δ glgC mutant, and several metabolites were detected at higher levels than in the wild type (Fig. 3 ), suggesting that the cells were not lysed, at least completely, during cultivation. In addition, the extracellularly detected Glu in the Δ glgC mutant was highly abundant compared to that detected intracellularly. Under the HN conditions on day 10, for example, 81.44 mg·L −1 Glu was extracellularly detected in the Δ glgC mutant, while the amount of Glu in the cells was 6.64 mg·L −1 , which was calculated from the intracellular level of Glu (28,365.21 nmol·g-DCW −1 ) and the accumulated biomass (1.59 g-DCW·L −1 , Fig. 1c ). This indicates that most of the extracellularly detected Glu in the Δ glgC mutant would be continuously released from viable cells during cultivation rather than being derived from cell disruption or residual cells when preparing extracellular metabolites. As it was also observed in wild-type cells, the extracellular release of Glu might be an inherent ability of carbon partitioning in response to environmental fluctuations. In addition to glycogen, several cyanobacteria accumulate polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) upon nitrogen depletion. The sll0783 (nitrogen starvation response protein) mutant of PCC 6803, in which PHB accumulation decreases, showed a higher level of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) before nitrogen depletion and lower levels of PEP compared to the wild type 22 , which is consistent with the present study (Fig. 3a ). In contrast, changes in 3-PGA, AcCoA, Cit, 2-OG, Suc, and Glu observed in the sll0783 mutant are not consistent with those in the Δ glgC mutant of PCC 7942 (Fig. 3 a, b). One of the reasons might be that the sll0783 mutant still accumulated glycogen and a small amount of PHB in the cells 23 . The de novo synthesis ratio of 2-OG, Glu, and Gln from CO 2 increased in the Δ glgC mutant under both LN and HN conditions (Fig. 4 ). The Δ glgC mutant showed high intracellular levels of 2-OG, a precursor of the GS-GOGAT cycle, under LN conditions (Fig. 3b ), probably because the conversion of 2-OG into Glu was strongly restricted due to the unavailability of a nitrogen source (Fig. 5 ). In addition to 2-OG, accumulation of its downstream metabolites (i.e., Suc, Mal, and Pyr) in the Δ glgC mutant (Fig. 3b ) suggested that conversion of Pyr into AcCoA was the rate-limiting step under LN conditions. As a result, Pyr and 2-OG would be excessively accumulated in the mutant, triggering the metabolic overflow into the medium under LN conditions (Fig. 5b ). A previous study suggested the involvement of an unknown Pyr/proton symporter as high pH causes an increase in the extracellular release of Pyr 16 . In contrast, the intracellular level of Glu in the Δ glgC mutant was significantly lower than that in the wild type under LN conditions (Fig. 3b ). Under HN conditions, the intracellular level of Glu in the Δ glgC mutant was not higher than that in the wild type after day 5, although it was released continuously during the culture period. These results suggest that Glu is released extracellularly via an export mechanism activated by glycogen deficiency (Fig. 5a ). A possible exporter of Glu is mechanosensitive channels (MSCs). In bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum , MSCs are known to export osmolytes, including Glu, upon osmotic downshift 24 , 25 . Homology search revealed that PCC 7942 harbors three putative MSC genes; the large conductance mechanosensitive channel protein gene mscL (Synpcc7942_1991) homologous to E. coli mscL gene, the mechanosensitive ion channel family protein gene (Synpcc7942_0610) homologous to E. coli ybiO gene, and the mechanosensitive ion channel gene (Synpcc7942_0664) homologous to E. coli mscM, mscS , and mscK genes. Although the role of MSCs in cyanobacteria has not been thoroughly examined, the mscL gene in PCC 6803 has been found to contribute to hypoosmotic stress adaptation and Ca 2+ transport 26 , 27 . In the present study, the increased extracellular levels and decreased intracellular levels of Lac in the Δ glgC mutant also supported the hypothesis that MSCs are activated by glycogen deficiency (Figs. 2 a and 3a ). Fig. 5: Alternative metabolic sink model of glycogen-deficient cyanobacteria. A deficiency in glycogen synthesis enhances the partitioning of carbon into Glu and its excretion via an unidentified transport mechanism ( a ). When the nitrogen source is unavailable, Glu synthesis is strongly restricted, which results in intracellular accumulation and extracellular overflowing of 2-OG, the precursor of Glu, and Pyr ( b ). Thus, Glu, 2-OG, and Pyr serve as the extracellular metabolic sink alternative to glycogen when its synthesis is deficient. Bold arrows indicate processes enhanced by glycogen deficiency. Grey arrows indicate abolished or restricted processes. 2-OG 2-oxoglutarate, 3-PGA 3-phosphoglycerate, Glu glutamate, Gln glutamine, Mal malate, Suc succinate. Full size image The synthesis of Pyr and 2-OG is hypothesized to function as an alternative dissipation mechanism for excess light energy when glycogen synthesis is deficient. In a previous study, the energy charge (defined as the ratio of ATP to ADP + ATP) was higher in a glycogen-deficient mutant than in PCC 6803 19 . This is consistent with the results of the present study under both LN and HN conditions, largely because of the low ADP levels in the Δ glgC mutant (Fig. 3a ). In addition, this study found that de novo synthesis and extracellular release of Glu increased in the Δ glgC mutant (Figs. 2 b and 4 , and Supplementary Fig. 1b ), suggesting that the GS-GOGAT cycle, not Pyr or 2-OG, was the actual alternative metabolic sink during glycogen deficiency. The conversion of nitrate to Glu is an energetically expensive process that consumes 10 electrons 10 , 28 . Therefore, Glu is a more suitable product for energy dissipation than Pyr or 2-OG when a nitrogen source is available. In the present study, nitrate consumption of the Δ glgC mutant was similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 1a ), suggesting that energy consumption via nitrogen assimilation was similar in the mutant. As another possible explanation, the present study proposes that Glu is released extracellularly for osmotic regulation, although further studies are required to gain a precise understanding of this metabolic phenomenon. Glycogen-deficient mutant cells are assumed to be under constitutive hypoosmotic stress because they accumulate fixed carbons as low-molecular-weight metabolites (Fig. 3 ) instead of as high-molecular-weight glycogen (Fig. 1d ). Therefore, they may activate MSCs that cause extracellular release of Glu as an osmolyte 24 , and consequently, carbon partitioning into the TCA cycle and GS-GOGAT cycle is enhanced for the supplementation of Glu. In conclusion, the present study suggests that glycogen deficiency in cyanobacteria enhances carbon partitioning into Glu, which serves as the prime extracellular metabolic sink alternative to glycogen. Methods Strains and culture conditions The cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and its Δ glgC mutant strain were used in this study. For the analysis, the cyanobacteria were phototrophically cultured in double-deck flasks on a BR-40LF bioshaker (TAITEC, Aichi, Japan). The upper stage of the flasks was supplemented with 70 mL of BG-11 (2.00 × 10 −2 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)-KOH (pH = 7.8), 3.04 × 10 −4 M MgSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 2.58 × 10 −4 M CaCl 2 ·2H 2 O, 2.24 × 10 −4 M K 2 HPO 4 , 1.89 × 10 −4 M Na 2 CO 3 , 4.63 × 10 −5 M H 3 BO 3 , 3.12 × 10 −5 M citric acid, 9.15 × 10 −6 M MnCl 2 ·4H 2 O, 2.69 × 10 −6 M Na 2 EDTA·2H 2 O, 7.65 × 10 −7 M ZnSO 4 ·7H 2 O, 3.20 × 10 −7 M CuSO 4 ·5H 2 O, 1.70 × 10 −7 M Co(NO 3 ) 2 ·5H 2 O, 8.68 × 10 −8 M Na 2 MoO 4 ·2H 2 O, and 6.00 × 10 −3 g·L −1 Fe(III) ammonium citrate) containing 17.6 mM or 7.5 mM NaNO 3 . The lower stage of the flasks was supplemented with 50 mL of 2 M K 2 CO 3 /KHCO 3 solution, which adjusted the CO 2 gas concentration to 1% ( v/v ). Cells were inoculated at an optical density of 750 nm (OD 750 ) = 0.1 and cultured under continuous illumination with white fluorescent lamps at 110–120 µmol photons·m −2 ·s −1 at 30 °C with rotary shaking at 100 rpm 29 . Measurement of nitrate and phosphate The culture was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 5 min to prepare the clear supernatant without cells. To determine the nitrate concentration using a calibration curve, the optical density of the supernatant was measured at 220 nm (OD 220 ) using a UV mini-1240 UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) 30 . The phosphate concentration was determined using a PiBlue Phosphate Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Construction of recombinant strain The homology arms for the glgC gene (Synpcc7942_0603) were amplified from the PCC 7942 genomic DNA by PCR using the following primer pairs: upstream: 5′-AGTGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCCCAGCGATCCGTGTCCCTACTC-3′ and 5′- CAATCTCCCCCAAGTCAAGCGG-3′; downstream: 5′-CACCATGCGCCTCGGCAAAG-3′ and 5′-GACCATGATTACGCCCTGCAGCAATTGCCCTAAGACAGTTGTCGTCTTTC-3′. Homology arms and a gentamycin acetyltransferase gene cassette were cloned into a plasmid vector using an In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit (Takara Bio USA, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA). To construct a recombinant strain harboring Δ glgC mutation, PCC 7942 cells were cultured in BG-11 medium to the mid-exponential phase (OD 750 = 1.0, approximately), washed once with the medium, and resuspended with 10 times concentration in the medium. Next, 100 μL of the cell suspension was mixed with 1 μg of the plasmid. After slow rotation in the dark overnight, the mixture was spread onto a 0.45 μm pore size nitrocellulose filter (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA) placed on a BG-11 agar plate. The agar plates were incubated at 30 °C under continuous illumination using white fluorescent lamps. After 2 days, the filter attached with cells was transferred onto a fresh BG-11 agar plate containing 2 mg·L −1 gentamicin for further cultivation and selection. Single colonies were individually cultured in BG-11 medium, and complete segregation of the Δ glgC mutant was confirmed using PCR of genomic DNA using the primer pair 5′-CCAGCGATCCGTGTCCCTACTCG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CAATTGCCCTAAGACAGTTGTCGTCTTTC-3′ 31 . Measurement of glycogen Cells were harvested via centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min, washed once with 20 mM ammonium carbonate, and lyophilized. Dried cells (5 mg) were suspended in 100 μL of 30% ( w/v ) KOH and incubated at 90 °C for 90 min. Next, 300 μL of ethanol (pre-cooled at 4 °C) was added, and the sample was mixed by vortexing and incubated on ice for 1 h. After centrifugation at 7500 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, the resulting pellet was washed twice with 300 μL of ethanol (pre-cooled at 4 °C) and dried at 80 °C for 30 min. Glycogen was extracted by adding 100 μL of water and incubating under 1800 rpm agitation at 25 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, glycogen in the supernatant was enzymatically hydrolyzed into glucose by incubating with 320 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH = 4.9) and 40 U·mL −1 glucoamylase from Rhizopus sp. (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan) under 200 rpm agitation at 50 °C for 2 h, which was followed by inactivation of the enzyme at 95 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min, the glucose released into the supernatant was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography system (Shimadzu) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Glycogen (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) was used as a quantitative standard to determine the glycogen content using a calibration curve 32 . Metabolome analysis To analyze the extracellularly released metabolites, the cells in the culture broth were completely removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 5 min. The clear supernatant without cells (500 μL) was mixed with 500 μL chloroform that was pre-cooled at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the upper layer was collected and filtered using UFC5003BK (Merck Millipore). The flow through was added with 400 μM l -methionine sulfone and 400 μM piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (PIPES) as the internal standards 29 . To prepare intracellular metabolites, cells equivalent to 5 mg dry weight were harvested from the culture broth by filtration using 1 μm pore size polytetrafluoroethylene filters (Merck Millipore). The cells on the filter were washed once with 20 mM ammonium carbonate (pre-cooled at 4 °C) and immediately resuspended in 2 mL of methanol (pre-cooled at −30 °C) containing 37.3 μM l -methionine sulfone and 37.3 μM PIPES as internal standards. The cell suspension (500 μL) was added to 200 μL ultrapure water and 500 μL chloroform pre-cooled at 4 °C and then vigorously mixed using vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the aqueous layer was collected and filtered through an Amicon Ultra-0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit UFC5003BK (Merck Millipore) by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C. The sample (300 μL) was dried under vacuum using a centrifugal evaporator CEV-3100 (EYELA, Tokyo, Japan) and resuspended in 20 μL of ultrapure water 33 . Extracellular and intracellular samples were subjected to capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOF MS) using a G7100 CE and G6224AA liquid chromatography-mass selective detector (LC/MSD) TOF system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). To investigate the de novo synthesis of metabolites, the cell culture on day 5 was subjected to 13 C labeling. To label newly synthesized metabolites from CO 2 , the K 2 CO 3 /KHCO 3 solution in the lower stage of the double-deck flasks was removed, and 25 mM NaH 13 CO 3 was added to the cell culture as a carbon source. After 0–12 h of cultivation under the phototrophic conditions described above, intracellular metabolites were prepared and subjected to CE-TOF MS analysis. The ratio of 13 C to total carbon ( 13 C fraction) of the metabolite was determined based on shifts between the 12 C and 13 C mass spectra 29 . Statistics and reproducibility Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation of three replicate experiments. Statistical significance was determined using the Welch’s t test.

We sequenced and assembled the G. dulcis genome de novo using a combination of long- and short-read sequencing, which resulted in high-quality consensus sequences of the chromosome and two plasmids. We leveraged the G. dulcis genome to generate a genome-scale metabolic model ( iGd895 ) to simulate growth in silico . iGd895 represents, to our knowledge, the first genome-scale metabolic reconstruction developed for an extremely xerotolerant cyanobacterium. The model's predictive capability was assessed by comparing the in silico growth rate with in vitro growth rates of G. dulcis , in addition to the synthesis of trehalose. iGd895 allowed us to explore simulations of key metabolic processes such as essential pathways for water-stress tolerance, and significant alterations to reaction flux distribution and metabolic network reorganization resulting from water limitation. Our study provides insights into the potential metabolic strategies employed by G. dulcis , emphasizing the crucial roles of compatible solutes, metabolic water, energy conservation, and the precise regulation of reaction rates in their adaptation to water stress.

Wangikar Introduction Gloeocapsopsis dulcis strain AAB1 is a hypolithic and extremely xerotolerant cyanobacterium first identified in biofilms collected from the underside of translucent quartz stones in the Atacama Desert’s Coastal Range 1 . Azua-Bustos et al. 1 suggested that the hypolithic biofilms rely on the regular coastal fogs, known as camanchacas, as their main source of water. Specifically, G. dulcis was shown 2 to tolerate desiccating conditions in-part by increasingly synthesizing the compatible solutes trehalose and sucrose following several weeks to months of desiccation at the extremely low sustained water activity (a w ) of 0.4. The accumulation of compatible solutes is one of the many adaptation mechanisms involved in microbial xerotolerance 3 . Bacteria can biosynthesize or scavenge these solutes from the environment to maintain osmotic equilibrium and protein function 4 , 5 . Other cellular adjustments due to xeric stress may include changes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, upregulation of DNA-repair proteins and reactive oxygen species scavengers, potential dormancy or sporulation, and an up- or down-regulation of certain metabolic pathways depending on changes in energy demands 6 . The specific metabolic adaptations employed by extremely desiccation-tolerant cyanobacteria like G. dulcis remain relatively unknown. However, understanding these adaptations could be critical in identifying strategies for the survival of life in arid planetary environments such as Mars, especially given that the Atacama Desert is an established Martian analog 7 . In this study, we developed a genome-scale model (GEM; iGd895 ) to explore the metabolic capacity of G. dulcis undergoing desiccation. GEMs have been used to decipher microbial metabolism by integrating genomic information into a mathematical framework that simulates metabolism using optimization techniques, such as flux balance analysis (FBA) 8 . This technique allows for the prediction of cellular growth and production rates of metabolites under specified conditions. GEMs have been utilized for diverse applications, such as predicting enzyme functions, modeling microbial cell interactions 9 , and investigating microbial growth in various environmental contexts 10 , 11 . We simulated iGd895 growth using FBA techniques and the COMparision of METabolic states pipeline (ComMet) to elucidate the potential metabolic strategies employed by G. dulcis undergoing desiccation. Through the utilization of these techniques, we identified crucial metabolic pathways and reactions potentially involved in desiccation tolerance. Additionally, we determined how these pathways may undergo shifts in response to water limitation. By shedding light on the metabolic adaptations employed by an extremely xerotolerant cyanobacterium, our findings provide not only new insights into the potential mechanisms of desiccation tolerance but also hold promise for the search for microbial life in similar arid environments. Methods DNA extraction and sequencing DNA was extracted directly from dried G. dulcis cells that were originally isolated by Azua-Bustos et al. 2 from the Atacama Coastal Range. Briefly, 32 mg of the dried cells were hydrated with 300 µl of phosphate-buffered saline, vortexed for two minutes, and extracted using the Quick-DNA Fecal/Soil Microprep Kit (D6012, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The extraction was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions, except for the lysis step, which was performed using a TerraLyzer Cell Disrupter (Zymo Research) for 3 min. DNA was eluted in 20 µl and determined by a fluorometric assay (ThermoFisher Scientific, Qubit™ dsDNA HS Assay Kit Q32854) to have a concentration of 6.2 ng µl −1 . An Illumina paired-end sequencing library was created with the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (FC-131-1024, Illumina, San Diego, CA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The library was sequenced on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in a 2 × 250 paired-end run (PE250). Following sequencing, 6,867,392 Illumina raw read pairs were obtained. To prepare for ONT sequencing, DNA was extracted using the Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial Kit (D6007, Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) by adding five mg of dried cells and 200 µl of sterile deionized water directly to BashingBead tubes. Cell lysis was performed for 2 min using the Terralyzer Cell Disruptor, with a total of 23 mg lysed over five replicates. Replicates were pooled, and 500 ng of the extracted DNA was used to generate ONT sequencing libraries with the 1D ligation method (SQK-LSK108) and native barcoding (EXP-NBD103, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) using a “one-pot” barcoding protocol 12 . ONT sequencing was performed with a SpotON flow cell (R9.4.1) and MinKNOW software 1.14.1 (GUI 2.1.14) (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Following sequencing, 8302 long-reads were obtained, of which 8105 passed the pre-set filter (i.e., quality score > 7). Raw reads were rebasecalled using the “Super-Accurate” (SUP) model Guppy basecaller (v6.0.1) integrated in MinKNOW prior to sequence assembly. Sequence assembly and analysis The genome sequence was assembled de novo using the Trycycler v0.5.3 hybrid assembly pipeline 13 . First, the ONT reads were subjected to quality control using Filtlong v0.2.1 14 . The reads were subsampled with Trycycler to create 12 read sets. Twelve assemblies were generated from the read sets using the Flye v2.9 15 and Raven v1.8.1 16 assemblers (i.e., six assemblies were made with each assembler). The assemblies were visually inspected using Bandage 17 . The contigs were clustered and reconciled using Trycycler’s cluster and reconcile commands, respectively. This resulted in three clusters: one representing the main chromosome, and the other two representing each plasmid. ONT reads were then partitioned between the reconciled clusters using Trycycler’s partition command. Finally, Trycycler’s consensus command was used to make the consensus sequences for each of the three clusters. Next, Illumina reads were trimmed with Trimmomatic 18 , which dropped 0.38% of the total reads (i.e., 26,287). The surviving 6,260,175 Illumina read pairs were quality controlled using fastp 19 . The Illumina reads were then used to polish the ONT consensus sequences in two rounds; first with Polypolish v0.5.0-1 20 , and then again with POLCA 21 . Sequence quality, completeness, and potential contamination were checked using the CheckM lineage workflow 22 . The online RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology) service was used to annotate the genome 23 . We also used Prokka to verify gene locations within the main chromosome 24 . The annotated genome was visualized using the online Proksee tool ( https://proksee.ca/ ). The consensus sequences (i.e., chromosome and plasmids) were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) under BioProject PRJNA941297. In vitro culturing, optical density, and cell counts of G. dulcis Gloeocapsopsis dulcis cells, provided by Dr. Armando Azua-Bustos 2 , were grown in 250 ml flasks with 100 ml of sterile BG-11 medium (UTEX). Growth assays were conducted in triplicate with the addition of a negative control flask filled with 100 ml of sterile BG-11 medium. The flasks were incubated at 28 °C over several weeks with a 12 h on/off light cycle. Two mL of sample were removed from each flask and placed into semi-micro polystyrene cuvettes (BrandTech, Cat. No. 759075D) to determine the optical density (OD) at 600, 730, and 750 nm over several weeks using a NanoDrop One C instrument (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat. No. ND-ONE-W). Following OD measurements, G. dulcis cells were counted using a light microscope and C-Chip Neubauer Improved hemocytometers (Digital Bio, Cat. No. DHC-N03). Samples at an OD 730–750 of 0.1 were homogenized via vortex, and 10 µL were pipetted into each side of the hemocytometer. Cells within the five large squares (area of 1.0 mm 2 ) of the hemocytometer were counted, and the average was used to determine cell concentration. The data was plotted in R, and the package Growthcurver 25 was used to fit a linear regression model and determine the specific growth rate (µ). Reconstruction and manual curation of the metabolic network The draft reconstruction was created in KBase using the “Build Metabolic Model” app and the RAST-annotated genome 26 . KBase built the draft biomass objective function based on its Gram-negative biomass template, which assumes a DNA, RNA, protein, cell wall, lipid, and cofactor fraction of the biomass as 0.026, 0.0655, 0.5284, 0.25, 0.075, and 0.1, respectively. The draft model was gapfilled in KBase on “complete media”, and then downloaded in SBML and Excel formats for manual curation. In Python, the biomass objective function was updated based on the genome and cyanobacterial biomass compositions (i.e., from Nogales et al. 27 and Shastri and Morgan 28 ) using the COBRApy library 29 to reflect a biomass fractions of DNA, RNA, protein, cell wall, lipid, cofactors, carbohydrates, and other as 0.031, 0.17, 0.51, 0.06, 0.12, 0.04, 0.034, and 0.003, respectively. Growth-associated maintenance energy, deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, amino acids, cofactors, and inorganic ions (mmol gDW −1 ) were determined using the methods of Thiele and Palsson 30 . The specific biomass composition calculations are detailed in File S1 . The flux of pigments in the biomass objective were included based on Toyoshima et al. 31 . Following that, 45 photosynthesis-related reactions were added to the model (File S1 ). The reactions were originally developed by Yoshikawa et al. 33 and later refined by Toyoshima et al. 31 to model the photosynthetic metabolism of cyanobacteria under different spectral lights (e.g., Akimoto et al. 32 ). Incident photon sites were described as reactions R0001, R0010, and R0022, for the phycobilisome, photosystem II, and photosystem I, respectively. State transitions, or the energy transfer from the phycobilisome to photosystems I and II, were described as reactions R0006 and R0007, respectively. We used the incident photon ratio of Synechocystis grown under white light as the flux of the photon incident sites 31 . The photon incident rate for the simulation was normalized to 495 mmol gDW −1 h −1 as per the rationale explained below. The total cellular surface area per gram of G. dulcis biomass was estimated as follows: a spherical G. dulcis cell is 3.3 µm diameter 34 , with a volume of 19 µm −3 , and surface area of 34 µm 2 . We estimated a dry cell weight of 7.4 pg by assuming that 70% of the cell was water 35 , 36 , and that the remaining ~ 1/3 of cellular components had a density of 1.3 g cm −3 37 . Thus, the surface area per gram dry weight of biomass was estimated as 4.59 m 2 . From there, a photon uptake rate of 495 mmol gDW −1 h −1 could be converted to 30 μE m −2 s −1 , which is the average photosynthetic photon flux density experienced by G. dulcis living under quartz rocks, and in the laboratory 1 . Reactions were manually curated according to Thiele and Palsson 30 . Briefly, confidence scores were assigned to each reaction based on what level of evidence is there to support inclusion of the biochemical reaction. Biochemical, genetic, or sequence/physiological data would receive a confidence score of 4, 3, or 2, respectively. Much of the G. dulcis reactions received confidence scores of 2, where only sequence data was available. Identified genes were manually assigned to the corresponding reactions in the Excel version of the model (File S1 ). Out of the annotated reactions, approximately 10% had confidence scores of 1, indicating no available evidence for those reactions (i.e., 125 reactions; File S1 ). These were either transport or gapfilled reactions, but were necessary for modeling and were only incorporated when there was supporting evidence for other reactions in the pathway. When available, Enzyme Commission (EC) codes and associated pathways were identified using KEGG and included in the Excel version of the GEM 38 . Once the manual curation was complete, a FROG report was generated using FLUXER 39 , and the GEM was tested in MEMOTE 40 to determine growth rate robustness using different simulators. MEMOTE also identified orphan and dead-end metabolites, and universally blocked reactions. These specific metabolites can only be consumed or produced by the model (i.e., for orphan or dead-ends, respectively). Universally blocked reactions are those that cannot carry a flux even without constraints imposed by the growth medium. Both orphan and dead-end metabolites and universally blocked reactions represent knowledge gaps that can be filled in the future with additional data 30 . These reactions and metabolites were documented in File S2 . The final curated model was deposited in the EMBL-EBI BioModels database and was designated with the perennial identifier: MODEL2303050001. The full FROG report, and model in SBML, YAML, MATLAB, JSON, and Excel formats can be found in File S1 , and on GitHub ( https://github.com/Drrachelmoore/Gloeocapsopsis_dulcis-GEM ) where it will be curated with additional data in the future. Constraints and flux balance analysis (FBA) We developed the GEM growth medium based on the BG-11 recipe used to grow G. dulcis in the laboratory (File S1 ) following the methods of Marinos et al. 41 . iGd895 growth was then simulated with FBA in COBRApy (Version 0.25.0; Ebrahim et al. 29 ) with the Gurobi Optimizer in Python (Version 3.10; Van Rossum et al. 42 ) using the PyCharm IDE. Briefly, we used the model.optimize() function to run the FBA and determine optimal growth rates within the constraints of the BG-11 medium. We also simulated single reaction deletions using the knock_out() function to determine reaction essentiality for both water-uptake constrained and unconstrained simulations. Water exchange with the environment was restricted to 2 mmol gDW −1 day −1 in the constrained FBA simulations. This resulted in a maximum yield of 0.1 g H 2 O gDW −1 (i.e., 6 mmol H 2 O gDW −1 ), which roughly corresponded to an A w of 0.5 6 , 43 . Comparison of metabolic states We used the COMparison of METabolic states (ComMet, v1.0) method in MATLAB (version 9.13.0.2049777, R2022b) to compare metabolic states for G. dulcis with and without water constraints 44 , 45 . Default parameters were used unless stated otherwise. Briefly, the ComMet method works by creating a constrained and an unconstrained version of a GEM, where the constraint is placed on the uptake of a specific substrate. It then follows a seven-step pipeline to decompose the flux spaces into modules, conduct principal component analysis, basis rotation, and independent component analysis to compare the metabolic states. Specifically, we constrained the water uptake to 12 mmol gDW −1 h −1 for the constrained GEM to investigate changes in the iGd895 metabolic network with xeric stress. Following ComMet preprocessing of the GEM flux spaces, we determined the flux distribution for all of the reactions in the unconstrained and constrained GEMs using the expectation propagation algorithm 46 . Next, we used ComMet’s PCA-based approach to decompose the flux spaces and extract global modules. Finally, xeric-stress-specific modules were identified using independent component analysis. Following analysis with ComMet, Cytoscape (Version 3.9.1) was utilized to plot the module networks 47 . R and R Studio (Version 2021.09.0) along with the ggplot2 library were used to generate plots of the flux distribution data 48 , 49 . Results and discussion Gloeocapsopsis dulcis genome Genomic characteristics for G. dulcis are summarized in Table 1 . Following sequence assembly in Trycycler 13 we obtained a genome comprised of a ~ 5.29 Mbp chromosome and two plasmids, 11,484 and 307,228 bp in size. The mean read depth of the main chromosome was 492× as determined by Polypolish 20 . The mean read depth for the larger and smaller plasmid was 518× and 1040×, respectively. Following genome polishing with POLCA 21 , the consensus quality and consensus QV were estimated to be 99.9999 and 61.22, respectively, corresponding to an expected value of 4 errors across the genome. We then used the CheckM lineage workflow 22 to determine a genome completeness of 100%, and a low potential sequence contamination of 1.44% (Fig. S1 ) (e.g., from cross-barcode reads). The predicted level of sequence contamination was lower than the recommended threshold (i.e., 5%) for classifying a genome as contaminated 50 . Table 1 Comparison of G. dulcis characteristics between closed and draft sequence. Full size table The overall genome included 5754 coding sequences and 45 RNA genes. The GC content was 42.5%. The general characteristics (e.g., size, GC content, etc.) of the closed genome matched well with the original draft sequence produced by Puente-Sánchez et al. 51 (Table 1 ). One hundred and ten more coding sequences and two more RNA genes were identified in the closed genome as compared to the original draft. The chromosome and plasmids were annotated and visualized with Proksee to further analyze the genome (Figs. 1 and S2 ). Azua-Bustos et al. 2 previously identified two candidate genes involved in the synthesis of the compatible solute sucrose: sucrose 6-phosphate synthase and sucrose 6-phosphate phosphatase. We identified the location of those genes on the chromosome, as well as other potential genes associated with the production of trehalose, which is another compatible solute produced by G. dulcis (Fig. 1 ). We also identified other potential stress-related genes ( supplemental results and discussion ). These genes were discovered in both RAST and Prokka annotations, which were carried out separately, to confirm their presence and location in the genome 23 , 24 . Figure 1 Map of the G. dulcis chromosome. Starting from the outer ring, rings one and two show coding sequences (CDS) from the forward and reverse strands, respectively. Green and red arrows within rings one and two depict tRNA and rRNA. Ring three depicts GC skew; ring four shows GC content. The gene names in refer to the following enzymes: sucrose synthase (i.e., susA ; EC 2.4.1.13; gene 916), sucrose-phosphate phosphatase (i.e., sppA ; EC 3.1.3.24; gene 3354), trehalose synthase (i.e., treS_1 , treS_2; EC 5.4.99.16, gene 5376 and 5379), and trehalase (i.e., treA ; EC 3.2.1.28; gene 4126). Full size image Metabolic model reconstruction GEMs enable the exploration of an organism’s metabolic capacities under various environmental conditions. We generated a new GEM ( iGd895 ) using the G. dulcis genome to further elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying desiccation tolerance (File S1 ). iGd895 consisted of 1251 reactions and 1198 metabolites (Table 2 ). Of the 1251 reactions, 98 were exchange reactions, and 74 were reactions that were automatically gapfilled using KBase on complete medium 26 . Exchange reactions are those that represented the nutritional boundaries of the system 30 . Gapfilled reactions are those that were added to the GEM to fill pathway gaps in the metabolic network. Table 2 Characteristics of the reconstructed model of G. dulcis . Full size table iGd895 included three compartments, the cytosol, extracellular space, and the thylakoid, which is the membrane-bound compartment that accommodates photosynthetic machinery and reactions in cyanobacteria 52 . The total functional classification of the 1147 metabolic reactions (i.e., non-exchange reactions) is presented in Table S2 . The complete list of all reactions is located in the model files in File S1 . Validation of the FBA simulation using cultivation data To verify the accuracy of iGd895 , we compared the model’s growth rate with experimental growth rates. We found that an OD 730–750 of 0.1 for G. dulcis corresponded to a cell count of 6.9 ± 0.45 × 10 5 ml −1 . We determined the in vitro growth rate of G. dulcis to be 0.06 ± 0.007 day −1 (Fig. 2 ), which is equivalent to the growth rate determined in Azua-Bustos et al. 2 for G. dulcis grown at a light intensity of 10 μmol quanta m −2 s −1 (i.e., 0.0649 ± 0.0096 day −1 ; values extracted from figure). Figure 2 Growth curve and specific growth rate (µ) of G. dulcis grown in BG-11 liquid medium. Full size image The simulated specific growth rate of iGd895 on the in-silico BG-11 growth medium was found to be 0.0694 day −1 , falling within the range of the experimentally observed growth rates. This indicated that the model adequately replicated the metabolic activities that take place in G. dulcis on BG-11. Still, caution should be applied to the interpretation of iGd895 results as further validation would require additional experimental data that was beyond the scope of this study and not yet available in the literature. In silico testing of compatible solute synthesis We investigated the following reactions to determine which were involved in trehalose or sucrose production in iGd895 under clement and desiccating conditions: reactions rxn01134 and rxn01966 for trehalose production, and rxn00577, rxn00578, and rxn00579 for sucrose production ( supplemental results and discussion ). In iGd895 , trehalose was only produced under constrained water conditions, and only through reaction rxn01966. Trehalose was consumed, as expected, via reaction rxn00007 which encoded the enzyme trehalase. Trehalose was not produced or consumed in the unconstrained model. Notably, Azua-Bustos et al. 2 did not detect trehalose via HPLC in G. dulcis cultures until one week after desiccation onset, suggesting its role as a specific response to extreme water stress. Reaction rxn01966 encoded trehalose phosphorylase (i.e., EC 2.4.1.64, TreP), which catalyzes the reversible hydrolysis of trehalose to produce glucose-1-phosphate and glucose. While the TreP enzyme has been found in cyanobacteria (e.g., Murik et al. 53 ), in vivo evidence of trehalose synthesis has only been shown with TreP isolated from fungi and certain bacteria like Caldanaerobacter subterraneus subsp. Tengcongensis and C. subterraneus subsp . pacificus (e.g., Ren et al. 54 , C. subterraneus was first reported as Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ; Van der Borght et al. 55 ). In constrained iGd895 , rxn01966 (i.e., TreP) synthesized 0.0023 mmol gDW −1 day −1 of trehalose, which suggested that trehalose phosphorylase may be able to function in the synthesis direction for G. dulcis . It should be noted that although trehalose was exclusively produced by TreP in constrained iGd895 , it can also be generated by trehalose synthase when it is set as the objective function (i.e., rxn01134). Thus, while we anticipate that TreP would be upregulated in desiccated G. dulcis , TreS may also be upregulated to synthesize trehalose in vivo. In silico analysis of knockouts and condition-dependent growth We simulated reaction knockouts for iGd895 to ascertain reaction essentiality for growth in conditions of unconstrained and constrained water uptake in BG-11 medium (File S4 ). In the constrained model, we limited water import via reaction rxn05319 to 2 mmol gDW −1 day −1 . Anything lower than this value resulted in an infeasible solution. For this reason, we interpreted the knockout results as G. dulcis experiencing dehydration stress, but not yet fully desiccated, and that these results can be used to investigate potential desiccation-tolerance strategies. Essential reactions were characterized as those that, when knocked out, resulted in no growth. Conversely, beneficial reactions were identified as those that resulted in an increased growth rate when knocked out. Nonessential and inessential reactions were defined as those that either had no impact on the growth rate or only had a minor impact (e.g., < 0.001 difference; supplemental results and discussion ). After conducting knockout simulations, we found that both models had at least 395 essential reactions (Table 3 ). In the constrained model, two additional essential reactions (i.e., R0006 and R0039) were required for growth. R0039 represented the incident photon flux at 620 nm absorbed by the phycobilisomes, which are protein complexes anchored to the thylakoid membrane in cyanobacteria. These complexes can absorb light within the 600–650 nm range using the pigment phycocyanin 56 . R0006 represented the change in energy transfer, where light energy absorbed by the phycobilisome was delivered to photosystem II 31 , 57 . Table 3 Comparison of essentiality results between unlimited and constrained model. Full size table In iGd895, photosynthesis with constrained water was dependent on reaction R0006 to transfer energy to photosystem II, indicating that the phycobilisome supported growth in water limited conditions. The identification of R0039 as an essential reaction in the constrained iGd895 model suggested a preference for the red-light spectrum when the objective is optimal growth. Cyanobacteria are known to concentrate their absorption efficiency within a narrow range of visible light wavelengths from 660 to 700 nm 58 . Cyanobacterial photosystems are less efficient at absorbing light in the green band of the electromagnetic spectrum, which typically ranges from 500 to 600 nm. This difference in absorption efficiency has been previously described by Gundlach et al. 59 as the “Green Gap”. Comparison of unconstrained and constrained metabolic states Applying constraints and the analytical approximation of fluxes We used the ComMet pipeline 45 to investigate the significant differences in reaction fluxes between the water-constrained and unconstrained metabolic states of iGd895. Unlike FBA, which relies on a specific objective function such as biomass production, the ComMet pipeline does not require such a constraint. This allowed us to more effectively consider the desiccation-tolerance mechanisms of G. dulcis , which are unlikely to involve the optimization of growth. Similar to the above FBA-based analysis, we first generated two versions of the iGd895 : ‘unconstrained’ and ‘constrained’. In the constrained model, the bounds for water uptake were limited to 12 mmol gDW −1 day −1 , as opposed to an unconstrained flux at 1000 mmol gDW −1 day −1 . Lower bounds for water uptake (e.g., 0–11 mmol gDW −1 day −1 ) prevented the expectation propagation algorithm from converging. Thus, as before, we did not consider it a true ‘desiccated’ model. Further preprocessing was carried out following the ComMet pipeline to remove 900 blocked reactions (i.e., those that were unable to carry a flux under the imposed conditions) from each model. Apart from the water constraint, ComMet set the bounds for the other exchange reactions in the models to allow for unlimited nutrient uptake, effectively removing them as a factor. However, to simulate photoautotrophy, 70 exchange reactions were removed from both models (edited ComMet code on GitHub). For example, exchange reactions of amino acids, nitrate, and organic carbon sources were removed to block mixotrophic metabolism and to better represent experimental lab testing scenarios. This preprocessing narrowed the unconstrained and constrained GEM to 289 and 282 reactions, respectively, from the original set of 1251. Following preprocessing, we used the expectation propagation algorithm from Braunstein et al. 46 in ComMet to approximate the feasible spaces of both GEMs, and in doing so, calculated the mean and standard deviations of the flux distribution for every reaction in the simulations. We produced a reaction-wise comparison plot of the means (Fig. 3 A), as described in Sarathy et al. 45 to visually inspect the differences that resulted from constrained water. Overall, we found that a majority of the reaction means were highly regulated and exhibited comparable summary statistics between the two metabolic states. However, some of the reactions displayed a noticeable deviation from the identity line, which indicated a change in the flux (Fig. 3 A). Our analysis revealed that 26 of these reactions, not including those that were blocked with constrained water, exhibited significant changes in their flux distribution between the conditions (File S5 , p << 0.05). Notably, these reactions were involved in several key metabolic pathways including photosynthesis, glycolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Figure 3 Comparison of the means ( A ) of individual reactions between the constrained and unconstrained model simulations. The black box highlights the reactions that were impacted by water limitation. Flux distributions are shown for one of the reactions significantly affected (p << 0.05) by water limitation ( B ), the thylakoid-based ATP synthase reaction. Its flux distributions are shown for both the unconstrained (blue) and constrained (orange) simulations. Full size image We created density plots to visualize the significant changes in the flux distributions (Figs. 3 B and 4 ). The flux distributions for the water-constrained simulation exhibited notable reductions compared to those in the unconstrained simulation. These reductions were reflected in both the location and shape of the distributions between the two simulations. More specifically, we observed that negative flux distributions shifted toward the right, and positive distributions shifted toward the left of the unconstrained simulation. The observed shifts in flux distribution suggested that the reactions may have been either downregulated or shifted toward a near-zero flux state, which could occur in vivo as a mechanism to reduce the occurrence of ROS-producing reactions and oxidative stress. The shifts in flux distribution were especially apparent for the ATP synthase and photosynthetic reactions (Fig. 3 B, File S5 ). Furthermore, the overall shape of the distributions changed from broadly dispersed in the unconstrained simulation to relatively narrower ranges, indicating a tighter regulation of the reaction fluxes (Fig. 4 ). Figure 4 Flux distributions for reactions within the glycolysis (rxn01100, rxn02380, rxn00747), carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms (rxn00018, rxn01111), purine metabolism (rxn01544), and pentose phosphate (rxn00772, rxn00770) pathways with significant differences in flux statistics between unconstrained (blue) and constrained (orange) simulations. Full size image These results are consistent with the current understanding of how certain cyanobacteria respond to desiccation in that several energy-consuming pathways tend to be downregulated. For example, Katoh et al. 60 demonstrated that genes related to photosynthesis, ATP synthase, and carbon fixation were downregulated in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC7120 following desiccation stress. Notably, downregulation of photosynthesis-related genes has also been observed in green algae in response to desiccation, and has been thought to reflect a shift from growth to energy-saving metabolism 61 . Studies have also demonstrated that certain proteins involved in glycolysis exhibit reduced expression levels during cellular dehydration in cyanobacteria. In particular, the gene for phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK , EC 2.7.2.3) was found to be downregulated and the enzymatic activity of triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI, EC 5.3.1.1) was found to decrease in response to water loss in Nostoc flagelliforme 62 , 63 . Consistently, our model revealed significant decreases in reaction flux for these glycolytic enzymes represented by reaction rxn01100 and rxn00747 in iGd895 when water uptake was constrained (Fig. 4 ). Further, reaction rxn02380, which is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI, EC 5.3.1.9), shifted toward a near-zero flux state with water constraints. This shift indicated the potential for the reaction to reverse direction from converting beta-D-fructofuranose 6-phosphate to alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate. PGI expression has been seen to increase in N. flagelliforme with water stress, potentially as a mechanism to enhance the synthesis of polysaccharides like sucrose 64 . Reaction rxn00018 (Fig. 4 ), catalyzed by ribulose-bisphosphate (RuBisCO, EC 4.1.1.39), has also been shown to decline in activity in water-stressed higher plants 65 and cyanobacteria 66 . Similarly, it was also downregulated in dehydrated Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 67 , suggesting that carbon fixation is affected by water stress in cyanobacteria. Further, the significant reduction in RuBisCO and phosphoribulokinase (rxn01111, EC 2.7.1.19) activity could contribute to the modulation of carbon fixation and the allocation of carbon resources to glycogen storage 68 . Reduction of pentose phosphate pathway reaction fluxes could also help to conserve resources that could then be redirected toward glycogen synthesis. Reactions rxn00772 and rxn00770 (Fig. 4 ), corresponding to pentose phosphate pathway enzymes ribokinase and ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (i.e., EC 2.7.1.15 and 2.7.6.1, respectively), were reduced significantly with respect to the unconstrained reaction fluxes. This may also limit oxidative stress through the reduction of ROS production. Identification of xeric stress-specific modules As demonstrated above, water limitation significantly affected the metabolic network in several key pathways. To further elucidate the interplay between reactions across the entire network, we examined “modules”, or groups of interacting reactions, whose flux variability accounted for the total variation of the simulation flux space. In other words, we used the ComMet approach 45 to first identify “global modules” ( supplemental results and discussion ), which we then utilized to uncover unique patterns of metabolic regulation between the unconstrained and constrained simulations using independent component analysis (ICA). ICA was performed on a combined set of 82 principal components (PCs; 41 from each condition). These PCs were chosen as they accounted for 99.9% of the flux space variation in both simulations ( supplemental results and discussion ). Initially, the ICA optimization script from ComMet was executed using a bootstrapping approach to determine the optimal number of independent components required for decomposing the original multivariate signal, which was found to be 38 (Fig. S5 ). Subsequently, the combined set of rotated PCs from both simulations and the optimum number were utilized to perform the ICA for 9000 iterations. The ICA revealed distinct features that corresponded to 17 rotated PCs, and comprised a total of 28 reactions. Eleven of these reactions were part of both distinct modules from the constrained and unconstrained simulations (File S9 ), including essential reactions such as those involved in oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, pyrimidine and purine metabolism, and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. The ICA results are illustrated in Fig. 5 as a combined network/reaction map. Figure 5 Combined network of distinct modules extracted from the 82 PCs that were biochemically distinct between the unconstrained and constrained reactions. Reactions are grouped by KEGG pathway. Pathways with more than one reaction present are highlighted with the blue underlay. Node color indicates the condition: constrained (purple), unconstrained (green), and both (orange). Edges indicate shared metabolites. The network is available on NDEx ( https://doi.org/10.18119/N9QK6F ). Full size image Only eight reactions were exclusive to the unconstrained network, while nine were exclusive to the constrained network, highlighting several relevant changes between the two metabolic states of the G. dulcis network (Fig. 5 ). Reactions belonging to the glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway (i.e., rxn01281 and rxn01280) and the glycolysis pathway (i.e., rxn00411) were exclusive to the unconstrained simulation. This indicated an emphasis on energy production to support growth and carbon fixation via the Calvin cycle when water was plentiful (Fig. 5 ). Rxn01281 and rxn01280 represented the reactions catalyzed by (R)-Glycerate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (GOR) and (S)-Glycerate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (SGOR) (EC 1.1.1.60). These enzymes are involved in the photorespiratory pathway, which operates in parallel with the carbon fixation pathway (e.g., the Calvin cycle) in photosynthetic organisms. The photorespiratory pathway is responsible for the detoxification of glycolate, a toxic byproduct of the oxygenation reaction catalyzed by RuBisCO, and the recycling of carbon and nitrogen. Glycolate is converted to glyoxylate via the action of glycolate oxidase and then converted to glycerate by the action of GOR or SGOR, depending on the availability of NADP+ or NAD+. Glycerate can be further converted to 3-phosphoglycerate by the action of (R)-Glycerate kinase and used in the Calvin cycle for carbon fixation, thus contributing indirectly to carbon fixation. However, the absence of these two reactions (i.e., rxn01281 and rxn01280) in the constrained simulation, raises the possibility that G. dulcis could adjust its carbon fixation strategy via these pathways, especially when faced with limited water availability. This adjustment might encompass recycling or even excretion strategies, possibly as a response to stress. This dynamic response could significantly influence carbon management within the cell. Notably, the reaction that represented the accumulation of glycogen (i.e., the glycogen demand reaction) was only present in the constrained simulation as shown in Fig. 5 . This suggested that G. dulcis may use glycogen as a carbon-storage mechanism during water-limited conditions, similar to what was indicated in the flux distribution data above (e.g., Fig. 5 ). Glycogen can serve as a source of carbon and energy during extreme desiccation or darkness 69 or as a metabolic sink for compatible solutes, allowing for the rapid modulation of intracellular osmolarity. Baran et al. 70 proposed that cyanobacteria may respond to changes in salinity by converting glycogen into compatible solutes, rather than synthesizing them de novo, and this mechanism may also be relevant for desiccation tolerance. Reaction rxn00411 was exclusively present in the unconstrained simulation (Fig. 5 ) and represented the final step of glycolysis, wherein pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) converts phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP into pyruvate and ATP. Although photosynthesis is the primary means of generating ATP in photosynthetic organisms, cyanobacteria may utilize glycolysis as an additional pathway to produce ATP. The exclusive presence of this reaction in the unconstrained simulation indicated that the limited availability of water in the constrained model did not support the costs of glycolysis reactions. ATP synthase (EC 7.1.2.2; reaction R048), which catalyzes oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP:NAD+ 2′-phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.23; rxn00077), which can catalyze the production of ATP from ADP and NADP+ in the nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism pathway, were present in both simulations. However, there were significant differences in the mean fluxes (File S9 ) of reaction R048 between the two simulations, as shown by the flux distributions (Fig. 3 B). The reduced flux via ATP synthase and the absence of ATP production through glycolysis (i.e., rxn00411) in the constrained simulation suggested that G. dulcis may prioritize energy conservation and/or employ the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6) enzyme, in addition to the other two enzymes, in order to meet energy demands. The presence of the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase-catalyzed reaction (i.e., rxn00237; purine metabolism pathway), which can generate ATP in cyanobacteria by transferring a phosphate group from a nucleoside triphosphate to ADP, was exclusive to the constrained simulation. This reaction may be preferred over the ATP synthase-catalyzed reaction as it requires less water for catalysis. Additional reactions exclusive to the constrained simulation in the purine (i.e., rxn01354, rxn00304, and rxn00840) and pyrimidine metabolism (i.e., rxn01128, rxn01129, and rxn00712) pathways may support this function (File S9 ). The latter reactions are involved the synthesis of dATP, whereas the former involved enzymes that can transfer a phosphate group to nucleoside diphosphate to form nucleoside triphosphates (e.g., dGTP, dATP, or GTP), all of which can be used in ATP production through the nucleoside-diphosphate kinase. Conversely, the only purine and pyrimidine metabolism reactions exclusive to the unconstrained simulation consume ATP to produce CTP and dCTP, respectively. This further indicated that G. dulcis may prioritize cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, and growth primarily when water is abundant, but shift to prioritize energy production and conservation during water scarcity. Photosynthesis reactions (R543, R0048, R0047) were present in both simulations, with R0047 and R0048 responsible for carotenoid transport and exchange, respectively. R543 represents the photosynthetic NADPH synthesis flux using ferredoxins. Only the unconstrained simulation contained reactions R0045 and R0046, which represent green light (i.e., 550 nm photon) exchange with the environment and absorption by the orange carotenoid protein. The only photosynthesis-related reaction exclusive to the constrained simulation was R0037, which represents quinol oxidase (EC 7.1.1.7), an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of electrons from quinol molecules to molecular oxygen, producing water in the process. The presence of quinol oxidase in the constrained simulation indicated that the production of metabolic water may be critical for survival during desiccation. For example, metabolic water production has been thought to sustain the hydration needs of cold desert soil-dwelling microbes 71 . The production of metabolic water may also play a role in supporting the stability of cellular structures, such as proteins and membranes, which are prone to damage and denaturation under desiccation stress. In addition, quinol oxidase is involved in the regulation of electron transfer in the respiratory chain and redox homeostasis, which may be crucial for maintaining cellular energy balance under stress conditions. Overall, the identification of quinol oxidase in the constrained simulation suggested that this enzyme could play a crucial role in generating metabolic water and maintaining redox balance, enabling survival in desiccating environments like the Atacama Desert. Conclusions Our findings suggest that G. dulcis cyanobacteria exhibit a multifaceted metabolic response to desiccation. Specifically, our genome-scale modeling analysis revealed significant metabolic shifts that may occur during desiccation, particularly during the initial limitation of water. These shifts involved the reconfiguration of metabolism from ATP production/consumption to a greater emphasis on ATP conservation, as well as a reduced emphasis on carbon fixation in favor of glycogen accumulation. Furthermore, our results highlight the potentially critical role of metabolic water production for G. dulcis survival during desiccation. The significant changes in reaction fluxes between metabolic states imply a tight regulation of specific pathways under water limitation. Finally, the closing and annotation of the G. dulcis genome led to the identification of several stress response genes that are likely to be upregulated during desiccation. Collectively, these findings advance our understanding of how microorganisms may survive extremely arid environments.

Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Photo courtesy of Finn Ryan of yaharaproject.org Blue-green algae blooms on large, shallow and nutrient-rich lakes may be related to ongoing drought conditions in Wisconsin this summer. The state has already received at least 93 algal bloom reports so far this year compared to 69 reports at the end of July last year. That’s according to figures provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The agency said the increase in reports this year is likely due to sightings of pollen and filamentous green algae that looks like long green hairs growing in the water. The latter can form floating green mats that turn brown and become smelly as they break down. About half the blooms reported so far — 48 — have been identified as cyanobacterial blooms. Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, has the ability to produce toxins that can make people or their pets sick. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Gina LaLiberte, the agency’s harmful algal bloom coordinator, said it’s possible drainage lakes may see more drought-related effects on water quality because rivers typically flow into them. She said conditions may begin to stagnate in those lakes if there’s not as much water moving through them due to a lack of rain. “The water gets really warm, the nutrients aren’t moving through, so that’s where you might be seeing more issues with cyanobacterial blooms,” LaLiberte said. LaLiberte said she’s received reports and photos confirming blue-green algae blooms on large and shallow drainage lakes like Lake Winnebago and Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Blue-green algae issues have surfaced over the years on Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Photo courtesy of Rhonda Cain-Carrell Despite the presence of blue-green algae, Rick Georgeson who lives and sails on Lake Petenwell said water conditions appear much better than years past. He attributes improvements in water quality to the efforts of producer-led groups that have formed in the Wisconsin River watershed. “These farmers are making some huge changes in the way they farm,” Georgeson said. “Cover crop and no till planting seems to be making a huge difference in what we’ve seen.” Satellite data has also detected cyanobacterial blooms on Lakes Petenwell and Castle Rock, as well as the Chetek Chain of Lakes in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chetek Lakes Protection Association represents around 500 property owners on the chain’s six lakes, which see around 40,000 visitors each summer. That’s according to Jamey Lideen, president of the association. Lideen said he’s unaware of any blue-green algae blooms and hasn’t observed any changes under drought conditions this year. Although, he said blooms often form in shallow bays on the lakes with low water flows after the July 4th holiday. “It’s very typical later in the summer that people in these small bays smell the decaying algae or see a buildup of it in those areas,” Lideen said, noting decaying duckweed is often mistaken for blue-green algae. LaLiberte said she hasn’t received any bloom reports from the Chetek Chain of Lakes, but state health officials received a question from a resident about the safety of water on the chain’s Prairie Lake. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has received and investigated at least 14 reports of illnesses in animals and humans that were suspected to stem from blue-green algae exposure. Of those, only three were potentially related to blue-green algae. “Symptoms associated with these cases have included things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash,” Jordan Murray, harmful algal bloom epidemiologist for DHS, said. “We had one dog illness so far, and symptoms with the dog included things like lethargy, seizure-like symptoms and vomiting as well.” A large cyanobacteria bloom on Lake Monona in Madison on June 29, 2019. Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Finn Ryan/ yaharaproject.org State health officials typically receive an average of 25 reports each year when blooms are most likely to form between May through September. “With the sort of drought conditions that we’ve been experiencing, hot weather, lack of rain creates these prime conditions for blooms to grow and to be produced,” Murray said. “With that being said, it’s possible that we get more illness reports throughout the end of the month and then into August as well.” Kids are especially susceptible to exposure. Murray said people can keep their kids and pets safe by steering clear of water that resembles green paint or pea soup. She also advised parents to remind their children not to swallow water while swimming. Ingesting water is the primary way that people can get sick, but people can also come into contact with blue-green algae toxins on their skin or by breathing in water droplets. For animals, health officials recommend giving their dogs breaks from swimming and rinsing them off after any potential exposure. As for the Great Lakes, the DNR’s LaLiberte said there have been no reports of blooms on the open waters of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior. Although mats of blue-green algae were found attached to the sediment of Barker’s Island beach in Superior on July 12 and 13. A short-lived blue-green algae bloom was spotted on Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, at the Barker’s Island beach area in Superior. Photo courtesy of Hannah Ramage with the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve Kait Reinl, a researcher at the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, said the mats contained two species of blue-green algae that have the potential to produce toxins. “But we don’t have any evidence that any toxins were actually being produced,” Reinl said. Toxic blue-green algae was found for the first time two years ago in the inlet of Lake Superior. It was a concerning discovery in the progression of blooms observed on the lake. The first documented blue-green algae bloom on Lake Superior formed in 2012 after massive flooding in the region. That was followed by another large bloom in 2018 that stretched about 50 miles along the lake’s shore. Researchers are keeping a close eye on blooms as climate change drives temperatures higher, warms lakes and causes more extreme weather events that set the stage for harmful algal blooms.

Credit: Seed Health/ John Kowitz Total 0 Shares 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Scientists are making major advancements towards rapidly accelerating the world’s capacity to remove and sequester access CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Seed Health is a microbial sciences company pioneering applications of microbes for human and planetary health, that announced its latest environmental research showing microorganisms that can perform extremely well in capturing carbon. The research is a collaboration, led by Dr. Braden Tierney and his team at The Two Frontiers Project (2FP), that aims to discover microorganisms that thrive in extreme, CO2-rich environments. This approach could potentially unlock novel solutions for carbon dioxide reduction. The researchers managed to succeed in discovering new cyanobacteria so efficient at consuming carbon dioxide that it outperforms other best-in-class carbon capture microbes. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are microscopic organisms found naturally in all types of water. These cyanobacteria grow in volcanic plumes and possess a huge appetite for CO2. Its qualities are also considered valuable in converting captured CO2 into biodegradable PHA bioplastic. Researchers document a thermal pool in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains. Credit: Seed Health/ John Kowitz “… when measured against some of the fastest-growing cyanobacteria described, the strain was more efficient at carbon capture under several conditions. They also seem to have adapted to the bubbling, churning environment of the volcanic plumes by becoming denser and sinking more readily, an unusual trait that could prove useful for potentially capturing carbon and sinking it into the deep ocean for sequestration,” said Max Schubert, Ph.D., a Harvard researcher who worked on the project. To discover the bacteria, the researchers conducted expeditions in Vulcano – a small island off Sicily’s coast and in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. The first expedition near Sicily was done in a collaboration with researchers from the University of Palermo. The team sampled water, sediment, and other sources of microbial life surrounding volcanic CO2 seeps. Relevant: Scientists Discover Predatory Ocean Microbe That Can Naturally Capture CO2 After the expedition, a broader team from Harvard Medical School, Colorado State University, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, cultured specific carbon-capturing organisms from the samples in a lab environment. The researchers isolated a never-before-seen volcanic green photosynthetic bacteria. The second expedition involved exploring carbonated springs in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, where dissolved CO2 concentrations are up to a thousand times higher than Sicily’s volcanic seeps. Credit: Phanom Nuangchomphoo | Shutterstock They sequenced DNA in the field and designed media on-site to target and isolate carbon-capture-efficient microbes, using Oxford Nanopore’s MinION system. The technique is also groundbreaking and a fundamental shift in how remote science is done in extreme environments. The team is now creating a unique, open-source ‘living database’ of extreme microbiomes, combining DNA sequencing data with a biobank of thousands of distinct environmental and biological samples. They are able to keep investigating the biology from their field expeditions long after returning to the lab. They can also revisit the stored samples and culture additional organisms of interest based on their computational analysis. Relevant: Loam Bio Raises $73M In Series B Round For Its Microbial Inoculum Approach The approach is innovative – pairing DNA sequencing with a cultivated biobank at such a scale is unprecedented in extremophile microbiology. It ensures the preservation of valuable metadata and biological material for future research and development. “Just as we’ve witnessed the tremendous impact of the microbiome on human health, this groundbreaking environmental research will be instrumental in unlocking the microbiome’s potential to tackle some of the most pressing challenges facing our planet, from carbon remediation to resource management to ecological preservation,” said Seed Health Scientific Board Member George Church, Ph.D. 0 0 0 carbon capture microbes Dr. Braden Tierney Seed Health The Two Frontiers Project Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

State officials say the blue-green algae has affected 113 surface waters in New Hampshire since 2004, mostly on lakes or ponds. This year set a record for blooms, with 69 across the state. Cyanobacteria are some of the oldest living organisms in the world, and are native to New Hampshire. But blooms – when the bacteria grow rapidly, and can be seen on the surface of the water – seem to be getting more prevalent, state regulators say. Blooms can pose a public health danger , producing toxins that can cause illnesses for swimmers or pets. The state’s plan includes four main strategies for dealing with the increasing threat of cyanobacteria blooms: control the nutrients that cause the blooms, teach Granite Staters more about cyanobacteria and how to identify it, enhance the state’s monitoring of blooms, and establish plans for responding to blooms in drinking water supplies. The two drivers of blooms are heat and the availability of nutrients like phosphorus in water. A 2020 study found that New Hampshire water bodies are warmer over the summer than they were 30 years ago. And as the areas around lakes and ponds become more developed, and climate change drives heavier storms which bring more runoff into water bodies, nutrients are becoming more available. The plan says focusing on limiting nutrients going into water bodies will have a more immediate impact on reducing cyanobacteria blooms than efforts to mitigate climate change, so the authors focus on that approach. “The things that we can do at the local level and even at the state level that really are going to affect change in our lakes in terms of reducing the prevalence of cyanobacterial blooms is controlling those nutrient inputs,” said Dave Neils, the chief aquatic biologist at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. Neils said managing septic systems, fertilizer application, and stormwater more effectively could help limit the nutrients that are carried into lakes and ponds by stormwater during heavy rains. For residents who want to help limit the nutrients that get into water, Neils said people can start capturing rainwater that falls off of their roof in a rain barrel to use in the garden, or dig infiltration ditches on their property to capture stormwater. Other solutions could take place at the local level, Neils said. Municipalities could extend the buffer zones around water bodies, require more frequent septic system inspections, or create utilities that manage stormwater. State regulators maintain a map of cyanobacteria alerts , and Granite Staters can report sightings of blooms at this link .

Harmful algal blooms are popping up more frequently across the U.S., and new research suggests that they may cause serious lifelong health problems. Like the algal blooms that have killed sea lions and dolphins across the Southern California coast, the cyanobacterial algal blooms found in fresh waterways throughout the state produce toxins while growing. The blooms are “alarming because it does not take a huge amount of these toxins to affect human health,” especially for people with medical conditions such as chronic liver or kidney disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, or type 2 diabetes, Saurabh Chatterjee , a professor of environmental and occupational health at UC Irvine, said.

LAKE ELSINORE, CA - AUGUST 25: In an aerial view, people fish in green water during a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, at Lake Elsinore on August 25, 2022 in Lake Elsinore, California. The city has closed the lake to all activities, including fishing, swimming and boating, due to the danger of serious illness or death in humans and animals. Fueled especially by drought and hot weather, California is experiencing some of the worst HAB outbreaks in the nation with an increase of more than 464 percent outbreaks in the past five years.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Cyanobacterial algal blooms The cyanobacterial algal blooms are made of bacteria, not algae, even though their blueish-green color and name may suggest otherwise, Chatterjee said. They are a kind of bacteria that researchers have identified in freshwater lakes, brackish water, and estuaries.

Skid Row 22 mins ago Police shoot man who allegedly ran at officer with knife Castaic 6 hours ago Deputy injured in fire at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic  dies These blooms are showing up in new places and more frequently due to rising temperatures and runoff, he said. The ashes from wildfires or the fertilizer from farming enrich the soil with nutrients, and heavy rain then pushes those nutrients into bodies of water where they feed the algae, especially by the coasts, he said. While it grows, the cyanobacteria release a toxin called microcystin that hurts animals, such as the fish living in a pond or someone’s dog running along the edge of an impacted lake, Chatterjee said. Health risks in humans The blooms “ultimately affect us because many households in this country get access to drinking water from the lakes,” he said, adding that people can be exposed to cyanobacteria by jumping in contaminated water or eating an oyster that had ingested some bacteria. “There is no foolproof method to completely eliminate microcystins from drinking water at this point of time, but there are a number of studies being carried out in association with EPA as well as the state’s environmental health department to make sure that we do not have signs of bacterial toxins,” he said. Though people with underlying conditions are more likely to develop diseases after being exposed to the harmful algal blooms, Chatterjee said that anyone could be impacted. “Low doses of these toxins can actually alter the reproductive pathways in a fashion that affects not only the female reproductive system but also the male reproductive system,” he said. Research suggests that microcystin causes irregular menstrual cycles and infertility related to ovulatory disorders. Though an individual may appear healthy following an exposure, Chatterjee said that cyanobacteria can weaken one’s immune system by harming one’s gut microbiome, making it harder to fight off an illness in the future . LAKE ELSINORE, CA - AUGUST 25: In an aerial view, a boat motors through green water during a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, at Lake Elsinore on August 25, 2022 in Lake Elsinore, California. The city has closed the lake to all activities, including fishing, swimming and boating, due to the danger of serious illness or death in humans and animals. Fueled especially by drought and hot weather, California is experiencing some of the worst HAB outbreaks in the nation with an increase of more than 464 percent outbreaks in the past five years.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Prevention The only public health measure people can take is advising recreational parks to close a body of water when there is a bloom, Chatterjee said. “However, you cannot do anything for the fish because you cannot tell the fish ‘Don't come into the lake and swim’ because they are there,” he added. Chatterjee said that removing algae from a lake is only a short-term solution. “There is absolutely no strategy to counter the long-term effects because, with climate change, this is going to come back year after year.” He suggested that one solution could be preventing runoff from entering bodies of water, but that “for the heat, we can't do anything unless and until we have a roadmap of the changing climate.” People should wait six months before visiting a place where there have been blooms and contact a physician if they are experiencing symptoms from an exposure, but “you can only treat the symptoms.

Why do viruses kill them? February 15, 2024 By 
							Meredith Woodward King Many of us hear about cyanobacteria when summertime blooms of toxic blue-green algae lead to beach closings at freshwater ponds and lakes. But cyanobacteria are not all bad — those growing in the ocean produce more than 12 percent of the oxygen we breathe, according to Clark Biology Professor Nathan Ahlgren. “Cyanobacteria form an important foundation of life in the oceans,” says Ahlgren , a microbial ecologist. At the bottom of the oceans’ food chain, “they produce organic material and oxygen, just like plants on land do.” Study life on earth Are you interested in studying living things and how organisms interact? Major in biology The most abundant cyanobacteria in the ocean are Synechococcus and its sister genus, Prochlorococcus. Together, these single-celled microbes carry out about 25 percent of the photosynthesis in the ocean, and because half of the photosynthesis on earth occurs in the ocean, he explains, that means that “in every breath you take, some of that oxygen came from these tiny little things.” Because cyanobacteria are so key to supporting life on earth, it’s critical to understand how they interact with their environment and with other organisms, especially the viruses — called cyanophage — that infect them. “It’s important to figure out what viruses are killing these cyanobacteria, how they are killing them, and why,” Ahlgren says. “There are some estimates that viruses might kill half of the Synechococcus cells every day and then the Synechococcus regrows to replace them. So there is constant pressure put on the cyanobacteria to grow and survive.” In many places, the number of cyanobacteria in the ocean roughly remains the same from day to day, he notes. “But in reality, there’s this whole ecosystem that’s churning, this warfare of viruses and hosts happening back and forth, that is potentially changing the species or the details of who is there.” Since its launch in 2020, the NSF-funded research project has supported nine undergraduate students working in Professor Nathan Ahlgren’s lab to explore the dynamics between viruses and Synechococcus cyanobacteria. “I really enjoy getting the experience of working in a real lab. It’s been really great for me,” says Angell Jean-Laurent ’24, a biology major who hopes to apply to medical school or a Ph.D. program in biomedical science. Study funded by $1.1 million in NSF grants Funded by $1.1 million in grants over four years from the National Science Foundation, Ahlgren and his collaborator, Biology Professor Marcie Marston of Roger Williams University, are using a decade of water samples gathered from Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island to examine these interactions between the cyanophage and their host, Synechococcus cyanobacteria. “It’s important to figure out what viruses are killing these cyanobacteria, how they are killing them, and why,” Professor Nathan Ahlgren says. He and his colleagues continue to draw water samples from Narragansett Bay, adding to Roger Williams University biologist Marcie Marston’s 10-year collection. “There are probably hundreds of species of Synechococcus , and each one is slightly different,” Ahlgren says. “Of the viruses that infect Synechococcus , there are maybe thousands, maybe tens of thousands. So, we have this complex community of thousands of things that are all interacting with each other. With this grant, we are opening up the box, looking under the hood, and sorting out the details to understand what’s happening in that ecosystem.” Over three years, teams at Clark and Roger Williams have isolated more than 100 Synechococcus strains and 200 viruses from the samples. Ahlgren credits a former undergraduate student — Campbell (Cammie) MacKenzie ’21 — with isolating most of the Synechococcus . MacKenzie’s research resulted in a 2022 article, “ Genome Sequence of the Estuarine Synechococcus sp. Strain NB0720_010 ” in Microbial Genome Resources , on which she was first author; her co-authors were Marston; Javier Tabima Restrepo , assistant professor of biology; and Ahlgren. With the microbes isolated and their DNA purified, “we can use DNA sequencing technology to figure out which viruses are in that community,” Ahlgren says, “and to answer questions like, ‘Are they abundant? Are they just there for a short time? Are they there all the time?’ We’re looking for seasonal or temporal patterns.” The project in Narragansett Bay builds off work published by Emily Dart , Ph.D. ’23, who characterized cyanophage patterns over five years in waters off of California. “It’s a bit mind-boggling to think that something that you can’t really see can have major environmental or anthropogenic effects.” — Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25 In the lab, the researchers will cross-infect the viruses with the Synechococcus strains, pairing different combinations of isolates, to study the microbes’ interactions. “We’re looking at these patterns in detail,” he says. “Does everything infect everything else? Do viruses affect closely related Synechococcus? Or do some viruses infect a lot, and some don’t?” Their research eventually could be applied to other environments where viruses attack bacteria, from freshwater lakes and ponds to the human intestine, according to Ahlgren. “Our expectation,” he says, “is that some of the rules about how this churning, constantly changing community of bacteria and phage are working probably would be applicable to many other ecosystems.” Dukilda Hasanllari ’23 and other students have helped isolate more than 100 Synechococcus strains from water samples taken from Narragansett Bay. Students also have participated in the research project by sequencing genetic material from the Synechococcus cultures as part of The Genome Project, an upper-level undergraduate biology course that is being taught this semester by Professor Nathan Ahlgren and, in past semesters, by Professor Javier Tabima Restrepo. Providing research experience for students From Clark to grad school Conducting microbial ecology research with Clark Biology Professor Nathan Ahlgren and his collaborators helped Cameron McIlvenna ’23 land a spot in a Ph.D. program at the University of Delaware. At Clark, McIlvenna majored in biology, with a concentration in mathematical biology and bioinformatics, and minored in computer science. Working with Roger Williams University biologist Marcie Marston, McIlvenna dove deep into DNA sequencing data for Ahlgren and Marston’s research project, applying what he was learning about bioinformatics. Last spring, he accompanied Marston to the 11th Aquatic Virus Workshop at the University of Laval in Quebec and presented a poster based on that research. Through Marston, he also met researchers at the University of Delaware. Since its launch in 2020, the NSF-funded research project has supported nine undergraduate students working in Ahlgren’s lab — MacKenzie, Cameron McIlvenna ’23, Dukilda Hasanllari ’23, Dariy Vykhodtsev ’23, Angell Jean-Laurent ’24, Eric Litvack-Winkler ’24, Emily Rosenbaum ’24, Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25, and Kavi Francis ’26; a Ph.D. student, Reynaldo Ponce; and a postdoctoral researcher, Brent Robicheau, whose research on phytoplankton in the North Atlantic explored the effects of coastal climate change. As part of their research with Ahlgren, Robicheau and Leaver will examine whether climate change also is affecting interactions between viruses and Synechococcus. More undergraduate students have participated in the research by sequencing genetic material from the Synechococcus cultures as part of The Genome Project, an upper-level undergraduate biology course being taught this semester by Ahlgren and, in the past couple years, by Tabima. (MacKenzie’s research in the course led to her Microbial Genome Resources article.) Ahlgren also incorporates the research into his Viruses: Friends or Foes and microbiology courses. “I took Professor Ahlgren’s virology class, and I’ve been able to apply the information I’ve learned here in the lab with that we’ve studied in the class,” says Jean-Laurent, a biology major who hopes to apply to medical school or a Ph.D. program in biomedical science. “I really enjoy getting the experience of working in a real lab. It’s been really great for me.” Leaver became interested in marine biology and Ahlgren’s research when, in her first year at Clark, she took his microbiology class. A biology major and political science minor, she will start Clark’s Accelerated Degree Program in biology next fall. “I really like the work that I do here because it allows me to think about the multiple perspectives of research,” Leaver says. “Sometimes you’re simply observing that an organism behaves a certain way, and you’re spending a lot of time going in depth about what that data means.” But over time, she adds, researchers might “find bigger implications, like uncovering shifts in population dynamics and even how things might move around the ocean because of climate change. “It’s a bit mind-boggling,” she adds, “to think that something that you can’t really see can have major environmental or anthropogenic effects.” “I really like the work that I do here because it allows me to think about the multiple perspectives of research,” says Devon Rose Leaver ’24, M.S. ’25 (above, working with Professor Nathan Ahglren in his lab). In the Accelerated Degree Program in biology next year, Leaver plans to examine whether climate change is affecting interactions between viruses and Synechococcus.

Look out for blooming harmful algae! Once again, it is time to keep an eye out for harmful algae (cyanobacteria) blooms in Washington lakes and rivers. As the weather heats up, these blooms can happen, especially in late summer and fall. However, it’s impossible to guess how each lake or river will be affected due to changing climate conditions and human-caused excess nutrient pollution. Some lakes bloom regularly, some lakes rarely have blooms, and not every bloom is toxic. The only way to know for sure that toxins are present in an algae bloom is through laboratory testing. When in doubt, keep yourself and your pets safe by avoiding water with algae blooms and pay attention to warning and closure signs. What are harmful algae blooms? Algae are simple plants and bacteria that are a natural part of the ecosystem, but certain conditions can cause algae to multiply too quickly, resulting in an algae bloom. Algae blooms can happen in both fresh and saltwater. Blooms often indicate that the ecosystem is unbalanced and can create issues in the food web and reduce oxygen in the water. However, only some blooms have the potential to be toxic to humans, pets, and wildlife, which is why they are (appropriately) called harmful algae blooms. The Washington State Toxic Algae website has more information about harmful algae. See our information below about a common non-toxic algae bloom ( Noctiluca ) we often see in Puget Sound. Blooms can look different based on the species present. Most harmful algae blooms in lakes or rivers are caused by cyanobacteria. Blooms can be short-lived but can continue happening into the fall and their toxicity can vary from day to day. Laboratory testing is the only way to confirm if a bloom is toxic. However, there are a few common characteristics of harmful algae blooms to keep an eye out for: The appearance of slimy scum, foam, or growing clumps on the water Algae color can vary — blue-green, reddish-brown, pea soup green Looks like a paint spill on the water Cyanobacteria are often confused with green algae, because both can produce dense mats that can get in the way of swimming and fishing. However, unlike cyanobacteria, green algae do not generally produce toxins. Additionally, be aware of these possible signs that you or your pet may have been exposed to a harmful algae bloom: Skin rashes after being in the water Sudden, unexplained sickness after drinking or playing in the water See a bloom, give it room Because harmful algae blooms can only be accurately identified by lab tests, when you can, it’s best to avoid going into water with algae blooms. If you suspect you or your pet have been exposed to a harmful algae bloom, rinse off with clean water and seek appropriate medical attention. If you spot a bloom, contact the local lake manager. This could be the county public health department, city, or state park, depending on the lake or river. Because there is no statewide, comprehensive monitoring program, reporting blooms can be helpful. Check with your local municipality see if they have more information or monitoring data on a particular lake or river. Harder than predicting the weather There are multiple factors that combine to create a harmful algae bloom in freshwater lakes and rivers. Generally, excess nutrients (especially phosphorus) are one of the major components, and these nutrients often come from human sources (runoff). If the nutrient levels are high enough, then other factors like weather conditions and water flow changes can also trigger a bloom. Even though we know generally what issues cause blooms, how all of the factors come together to create a certain bloom on a particular lake are still not well understood, which is why they are hard to predict. A lake with normal levels of nutrients during springtime can still get an unexpected bloom during the summer due to nearby urban development and runoff. Similarly, a lake with high levels of nutrients can avoid a bloom if certain weather conditions are not met. There are too many elements involved in the production of a harmful algae bloom to accurately predict when and where they will occur. How algae blooms can be prevented While the precise triggers of harmful algae blooms are hard to pinpoint, there are still steps you can take to prevent water quality from worsening and reduce a lake’s chances of developing a bloom. Keep in mind, each lake and river has unique circumstances and needs, so not every prevention step can be applied everywhere. Clean up pet waste. Maintain your septic system to prevent leaks. Do not feed water fowl, like ducks and geese. Reduce or eliminate the use of fertilizers. Wash vehicles away from the lake or storm drains. Maintain native vegetation around the lake. Only time will tell if this will be a big year for algae blooms. If you want to learn more see our related links at the top of the page. A bloom of a different color Around Puget Sound, a fairly common sight in spring and summer months is bright red tomato-soup-like salt water, often along the shore. While it may look alarming, this isn't a harmful algae bloom, it is caused by a particular species of algae called Noctiluca . Noctiluca is a single-celled organism, in a group called dinoflagellates that live in marine water. While this bloom isn't toxic to people or pets, Noctiluca does contain ammonia which make them unappetizing for other species to eat. Also, studies have shown this ammonia can have a negative impact on juvenile fish swimming in the bloom. While Noctiluca are naturally occurring and blooms have been observed and recorded in Puget Sound since the 1940s, there is growing concern that human-caused excess nutrients are increasing the intensity, changing the timing, and increasing the spatial distribution of Noctiluca blooms. Eyes over Puget Sound takes to the air once a month to obtain high-resolution aerial photographs, record observations, and gather water quality data at 37 remote marine monitoring stations to track and record how weather and climate are shaping Puget Sound water quality.

Beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is an environmental toxin that’s been linked to developing ALS , a progressive neurological condition marked by nerve cell damage and disability. It’s produced by certain kinds of cyanobacteria, also called blue-green algae, that live in marine and freshwater ecosystems. These microbes are part of the ecosystem of the Great Salt Lake, the largest saline lake in the Western Hemisphere. Due to ongoing drought and increased water diversion, however, lake levels have dropped to historic lows, exposing many lake beds. Because the local wind direction comes predominantly from the west, it’s possible residents living east of the lake — referred to as the Wasatch Front, which includes the highly populated Salt Lake City — could be exposed to airborne cyanobacteria and dust containing BMAA. Recommended Reading March 28, 2022 News by Lindsey Shapiro, PhD Collaborators Hope to Develop Rapid Test for ALS-linked Toxin BMAA Collecting air, soil samples During the summer and fall of 2022, researchers collected air and dried sediment samples to measure levels of BMAA and closely related molecules. The team included scientists from Bowling Green State University, Ohio, in collaboration with the nonprofit Brain Chemistry Labs in Wyoming, which has been monitoring BMAA and related toxins in bodies of water. Samples were also collected from exposed lake beds around the eastern and southern parts of the Great Salt Lake. Air sampling was carried out using a helicopter such that the amount of air that passed through filters was equivalent to an average person breathing for an hour. The analysis detected airborne BMAA only in August, along with a related compound called aminoethylglycine (AEG). There were no signs of diaminobutyric acid (DAB), a related toxin, at that time. Samples collected in September and October didn’t contain detectable BMAA, but AEG and DAB were found as free compounds in all the air samples taken then. Land surface samples were collected from the shores of the lake, exposed by receding waters, because the “wind would more likely pick up material from solid ground rather than water,” the researchers wrote. The number of collection sites with active cyanobacteria decreased over time between August and October. Trace amounts of BMAA were only detected in one sample in August and September, while the levels of AEG and DAB were higher than BMAA. There was “no clear relationship between the presence of these toxins in airborne and adjacent lake bed samples,” suggesting the airborne toxins may originate from widespread sources, rather than specific locations. “These findings confirm that continued low water levels in the Great Salt Lake may constitute an increasing health hazard for the 2.5 million inhabitants of communities along the Wasatch Front,” said the researchers, who called for a “better understanding of the exposure routes, types, concentrations, and synergism with other toxicants derived from the Great Salt Lake.” Print This Page About the Author Steve Bryson, PhD Steve holds a PhD in biochemistry from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Canada.

                    By Eve Zuckoff Published June 13, 2023 at 1:08 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Ashley Fisher/Town of Mashpee A cyanobacteria bloom at Mashpee-Wakeby Pond, seen on June 12, 2023. Local officials are warning people and their pets to stay out of one of the largest ponds on Cape Cod after a blue-green bloom was found to be producing toxins. Conservation experts are concerned that a high number of local ponds could be impaired by the blooms — sometimes known as cyanobacteria blooms — this summer. Locals reported the bloom on Mashpee-Wakeby Pond late last week to town officials, after noticing the pond water resembled pea soup. Cyanobacteria is often bright green or blue-green and it permeates the pond down through the water column, distinguishing itself from pollen, which is yellow-green and stays mostly on the surface. Ashley Fisher, the director Mashpee’s Natural Resources Department, said people should especially keep animals and small children out of the water to avoid getting sick. “Be cautious just because small children and animals can consume the water,” she said. “But we tell all residents: when in doubt stay out.” Town of Mashpee The town of Mashpee issued a cyanobacteria advisory for Mashpee-Wakeby Pond on June 12, 2023. Exposure to toxic algae blooms has been known to cause skin irritation, stomach problems, headaches and worse. Fisher said the town will retest the pond next week and wait for an all-clear before lifting the advisory. But, she said, she’s concerned by how early this algal bloom has been seen. “It's not unheard of, but it is early,” she said. “The last couple of years, it’s been in late July and early August. “ Last week, Falmouth officials also raised concerns about Coonamesset pond, where a “bright teal scum” was seen floating on the water at the shoreline. Ultimately, this could be a big year for toxic blooms. “We didn't really see much of a freeze this year and this is early for us to see these scum layers forming,” Fisher said. “So we're expecting those those cell counts to continue to go up. But we're monitoring.” Additional information about pond advisories across the Cape can be found at apcc.org/cyanobacteria .

Cyanobacteria are one of the most ancient forms of life, dating back to ~3.5 billion years ago. Highly abundant, these bacterial dinosaurs use carbon dioxide and light as inputs and convert them to energy, motion, and oxygen. The term ‘Active Matter’ is used to describe systems that take in and dissipate energy at the level of constituent particles and, in the process, perform systematic movements. Essentially all forms of life can be considered active matter. Injecting energy into an active matter system often leads to emergent collective phenomena, think flocks of birds or schools of fish. Though there has been extensive research on the photosynthetic action of cyanobacteria, quantitative exploration of the motion, arrangement, and potential collective behavior of cyanobacteria is relatively unexplored. Intrigued by exploring these phenomena further, two RASEI Fellows formed an unusual partnership to investigate, and their findings are reported in this article in Nature Communications Materials. In 2018 RASEI Fellows Jeff Cameron and Ivan Smalyukh were awarded a grant from the DOE to build a specialized microscope system for imaging photosynthetic microbes. The system includes an ultrafast laser system that enable multi-photon excitation in the pigments in the cyanobacterial cells, a technique that was essential for this investigation. Cameron, a member of the Department of Biochemistry, is an expert in cyanobacteria and photosynthesis, while Smalyukh, a member of the Department of Physics, is an expert in condensed matter physics, with a specialty in liquid crystals. The unusual nature of this partnership is not lost on them. “Normally Biochemistry and Physics are separated, making close collaboration difficult” explains Cameron, “especially when close experimental collaboration is needed, requiring routine access to environmental chambers and biological research labs as well as advanced laser labs”. A key feature in how RASEI is setup is the co-location of multidisciplinary researchers. Cameron notes “This enables researchers to work hand-in-hand on studies that would simply not be possible if the two labs were on opposite sides of campus”. Working together the findings from this team were conclusive; the cyanobacteria danced to the light! When a localized light was introduced to the bacteria, they harvested energy from the light through photosynthesis and used the energy generated to move towards the light. Experiments were done in two modes, one where the bacteria were confined to a two-dimensional plane, and the second where they could move in three-dimensions. In the two-dimensional system as the density of bacteria in the colony increased in the illuminated area emergent collective behavior emerged, with the bacteria forming a nematic arrangement, similar to that observed in synthetic liquid crystals. This emergent behavior was found to develop dramatically over time, with the direction, orientation, and trajectory of the cyanobacteria all changing, thought to be driven by an optimization toward enhanced light energy intake. Expanding this to the three-dimensional studies the team found that the cyanobacteria stacked on top of each other to form 3D active nematic slabs. The specialized microscope system enabled the teams to effectively explore these three-dimensional structures, even looking at cross-sectional views of the emergent behaviors. Comprehensive studies explored a range of properties of these emergent ‘Flocks of Cyanobacteria’, including examining transitions between fluid and gel states, the impacts of introducing defects, interactions between polydomain systems, and movement around foreign objects. Precise control of biological systems is the ‘holy grail’ in biomanufacturing. Spatial patterning of the cyanobacteria impacts the structural and functional properties of the bacteria. Cyanobacteria only require carbon dioxide, water, and light, and can produce biofuels, commodity chemicals, and minerals, all while pulling carbon dioxide out of the air and producing oxygen. Understanding, and more importantly being able to reliably control, the optimal conditions for these bio-manufacturing to operate has the potential to enable new avenues to utilize these biological systems in benefiting society and the environment. Armed with an enhanced understanding of how these bacteria move and can be controlled by light, the team is excited by the possibilities. Smalyukh explains “Our discovery of out-of-equilibrium active matter phase transitions in filamentous cyanobacteria systems may find utility in commanding collective behavior of cyanobacteria, with potential biotechnological utility ranging from control of bacterial mats and blooms, to oxygen generation an inhibition of toxin production”. Cameron adds “the possibilities are endless-once we can control the growth and orientation of biology, we can create novel materials and start to think about entirely new, environmentally-friendly, biomanufacturing opportunities.” There is something poignant when you consider employing these ancient lifeforms, that were responsible for the Great Oxidation Event, profoundly changing life as we know it, as active agents in pulling carbon dioxide, the key causative greenhouse gas in the climate crisis, out of our atmosphere. The understanding and control made possible through the investigations described here bring this one step closer.

													the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Study highlights the potential of cyanobacteria as biofertilizers by Christine Calvo, Florida International University Credit: Florida International University One ecosystem's trash could be another ecosystem's treasure, according to scientists studying cyanobacteria, more commonly known as blue-green algae. Cyanobacteria are commonly found in South Florida freshwaters and some are capable of producing a variety of toxins and harmful algal blooms . It also has a high iron content , unlike local crop soils. In a new study published in Environments , researchers found they can actually use cyanobacteria as a biofertilizer in iron deficient soils, turning this economic and environmental threat into a cost-effective solution for local farmers. ""Cyanobacteria as biofertilizers has not been used in South Florida,"" Agroecology Professor Krishnaswamy Jayachandran said. ""To our knowledge, this is the first study to collect naturally growing cyanobacteria for producing a biofertilizer and demonstrating ecological, environmental, economic and agriculture resilience."" Jayachandran, along with Earth and environment Professors Leonard Scinto and Mahadev Bhat, Postdoctoral Associate Saoli Chanda and Texas A&M University—Kingsville (TAMUK) soil science Professor Sanku Dattamudi collected a thick mixture of water and algae biomass from Lake Jesup in Central Florida. They repurposed the harvested cyanobacteria slurry to produce biofertilizers for growing high-value organic vegetables—specifically okra. Researchers used the samples for a two-year experiment at FIU's Organic Garden Shade House and Greenhouse. Four different treatments were conducted to evaluate the performance of cyanobacteria biofertilizers in the geographical and sub-tropical conditions of South Florida. ""This biofertilizer has 2,000 parts per million iron content which is a remarkable finding that will help farmers and reduce the cost of cultivation,"" Jayachandran said. ""The unique discovery of rich in iron content is a blessing to South Florida soils."" Using cyanobacteria as a biofertilizer can improve water quality by reducing nutrient runoff into surface water systems. It also boosts organic matter levels in porous calcareous soil bettering soil aggregation and stability. For farmers, substituting synthetic biofertilizers with cyanobacteria can save them up to 15% in production costs without any loss of crops allowing farmers to stay competitive.

Drew Pendleton July 17, 2023 4:15 am If the water in Idaho’s rivers and lakes smells bad, looks foamy or thick (like paint was spilled into the water), appears scummy, blue-green, or brownish-red in color, stay out, health officials advise. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) As temperatures increase, so does the likelihood of a cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom, or cyanoHAB. CyanoHABs are caused by cyanobacteria, and the toxins they produce are harmful to humans, pets, livestock and wildlife. CyanoHABs can change and increase rapidly if conditions are right. They favor warm water, sunlight and specific nutrients in the water. These blooms can last throughout the summer into fall. How to report an algal bloom in Idaho Online: Department of Environmental Quality Online form By phone: 866-671-5385 By email: [email protected] The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality samples and analyzes Idaho water bodies for cyanoHABs. The test results are provided to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and local public health districts, and they decide if a health advisory should be issued. For information on advisories, visit the DHW’s Idaho Recreational Water Advisories map for more information. The severity of symptoms depends on how a person or animal was exposed, how long they were exposed and the toxin type. Health effects for people Exposure to cyanobacteria and their toxins makes people sick. People are exposed by swimming in or swallowing contaminated water and breathing in tiny droplets in the air that contain toxins. Symptoms include skin irritation or rashes, blisters, lung irritation, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and vomiting; and they can lead to liver, kidney and nervous system damage. Health effects for pets (animals, livestock, and wildlife) Pets are most often exposed by drinking and swallowing contaminated water and licking the toxins off their fur. The fur of animals can collect a large amount of toxin, making it very dangerous for pets. Symptoms include excess drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, foaming at the mouth, jaundice, blood in urine or dark urine, stumbling, abdominal tenderness and loss of appetite. How to protect yourself, your family, and your pets Not all cyanoHABs are visible, and not all bodies of water are sampled. Therefore, the public is not always notified of all blooms throughout the state or the toxins they might be producing. When planning recreational activities in any body of water in Idaho, visit the DEQ and DHW websites for information, and always use caution by doing the following: If the water smells bad, looks foamy or thick (like paint was spilled into the water), appears scummy, blue-green, or brownish-red in color, stay out. If an advisory is posted, keep yourself, family, and pets out of the water. If an advisory is in place: Avoid swimming, wading, or other contact with the water. Take extra care to ensure children do not drink or get the water on them. Ensure pets and livestock do not drink or go into the water. If they have contact with the water, clean skin, hide, or fur with clean water right away. Do not drink or cook with the water. Boiling or filtering the water does not remove the toxins and can increase the risk of becoming sick. Wash hands thoroughly in clean water after handling fish or objects from the water. If you choose to eat fish from the water, clean and wash fish thoroughly in uncontaminated water. Filet the fish, and remove all fat, skin, and internal organs before cooking. Cyanotoxins can build up in fish, and the risk to people is unknown. Watch for symptoms. If you touch or swim in the water or breathe in water droplets, you might experience a rash, hives, red eyes, wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath. If you swallow the water, you might have stomach pain, diarrhea or vomiting. You might have a headache, muscle weakness or dizziness. If your liver is damaged, your skin might turn yellow, and you will have dark urine. If you think you might be sick from cyanotoxin, consult your health care provider or call the poison center at 1-800-222-1222. Notify [email protected] . Monitor media reports and the Department of Health and Welfare’s website for health advisories. As a general rule for anglers, swimmers, dog walkers, and anyone eager to jump into their favorite body of water, if a health advisory is in place, it should not be considered free and clear until that advisory is removed from the Idaho Recreational Water Health Advisories map . The bottom line for Idaho’s waterways is that cyanobacteria will not immediately disappear with cold weather and will remain in the surface water for long periods of time.

NH News By Degrees: Covering Climate Change Climate change is making harmful algae blooms more common. NH scientists are using drones to help. New Hampshire Public Radio | 
                    By Mara Hoplamazian Published October 16, 2023 at 3:59 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Courtesy / Christine Bunyon, University of New Hampshire Christine Bunyon, the researcher who led a study on how drones can help identify cyanobacteria blooms, gathers a sample from Keyser Pond in Henniker, NH. Harmful cyanobacteria blooms have become an increasing threat in New Hampshire’s lakes and ponds, as climate change warms up the state’s water and air. But researchers at the University of New Hampshire have developed a new, faster way to check for those toxic algae using drones. Cyanobacteria is a blue-green algae that can be toxic to humans and pets. To keep swimmers safe, officials with the state’s Department of Environmental Services go from lake to lake, gathering samples and testing for the bacteria. But now, scientists say they can use drones with special cameras to fly over the lakes to do the same work more than four times faster, and with high accuracy. Read more: How climate change is affecting cyanobacteria in N.H. and what you can do to prevent its growth . Russell Congalton, a professor of natural resources and the environment at UNH and a scientist at the N.H. Agricultural Experiment Station, worked on the project with graduate student Christine Bunyon. He says using the drone to look for cyanobacteria can also help find blooms that are happening only in some parts of the lake, but not in others. “Covering the entire lake is so powerful compared to maybe going to the corner of the beach and taking a water sample,” he said. “We get the whole lake so we can tell you, okay, it's not so good here, but it's fine over there.” The drone uses a multispectral camera, which can see wavelengths beyond what human eyes can perceive, to determine the concentration of cyanobacteria in the lake. Between May 2022 and September 2022, researchers flew drones over Silver Lake, as well as French, Greenwood, Keyser, Showell and Tucker ponds. They also took water samples in the more traditional way to compare results, and found the drone images produced accurate results. Congalton says there are some limitations – for example, if a water body is too large, the drone can’t register the ground around it to provide a location. And the researchers did run into some issues with the residents on the lakes they visited. “Initially people were like, ‘Why are you flying over our lake? We don’t want people violating our privacy,’ he said. “Once we talked to people about what we were doing there, they were actually very excited for us to come and visit their lake.” Tags NH News Climate Change Cyanobacteria drones New England News Collaborative Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Mara Hoplamazian Mara Hoplamazian reports on climate change, energy, and the environment for NHPR.

This 1.75 billion-year-old microfossil contains thylakoids, which identify it as a cyanobacterium. view more Credit: Emmanuelle Javaux Researchers at the University of Liège (ULiège) have identified microstructures in fossil cells that are 1.75 billion years old. These structures, called thylakoid membranes, are the oldest ever discovered. They push back the fossil record of thylakoids by 1.2 billion years and provide new information on the evolution of cyanobacteria which played a crucial role in the accumulation of oxygen on the early Earth. This major discovery is presented in the journal Nature . Catherine Demoulin, Yannick Lara, Alexandre Lambion and Emmanuelle Javaux from the Early Life Traces & Evolution laboratory of the Astrobiology Research Unit at ULiège examined enigmatic microfossils called Navifusa majensis ( N.majensis ) in shales from the McDermott Formation in Australia, which are 1.75 billion years old, and in 1 billion year old formations of DRCongo and arctic Canada. Ultrastructural analyses in fossil cells from 2 formations (Australia, Canada) revealed the presence of internal membranes with an arrangement, fine structure and dimensions permitting to interpret them unambiguously as thylakoid membranes, where oxygenic photosynthesis occurs. These observations permitted to identify N majensis as a fossil cyanobacterium. This discovery puts into perspective the role of cyanobacteria with thylakoid membranes in early Earth oxygenation. They played an important role in the early evolution of life and were active during the Great Oxygenation Event (GOE), around 2.4 billion years ago. However, the chronology of the origins of oxygenic photosynthesis and the type of cyanobacteria (protocyanobacteria? With or without thylakoids?) involved remain debated, and the ULiège researchers' discovery offers a new approach to clarify these issues. ""The oldest known fossil thylakoids date back to around 550 million years. The ones we have identified therefore extend the fossil record by 1.2 billion years"", explains Professor Emmanuelle Javaux, paleobiologist and astrobiologist, director of the Early Life Traces & Evolution laboratory at ULiège. ""The discovery of preserved thylakoids in N. majensis provides direct evidence of a minimum age of around 1.75 billion years for the divergence between cyanobacteria with thylakoids and those without."" But the ULiège team's discovery raises the possibility to discover thylakoids in even older cyanobacterial fossils, and to test the hypothesis that the emergence of thylakoids may have played a major role in the great oxygenation of the early Earth around 2.4 billion years ago. This approach also permits to examine the role of dioxygen in the evolution of complex life (eucaryote) on our planet, including the origin and early diversification of algae that host chloroplasts derived from cyanobacteria. ""Microscopic life is beautiful, the most diverse and abundant form of life on Earth since the origin of life. Studying its fossil record using new approaches will enable us to understand how life evolved over at least 3.5 billion years. Some of this research also tells us how to search for traces of life beyond Earth!"", concludes Emmanuelle Javaux.

Now, scientists have fossil evidence of the structures needed to turn sunlight into chemical energy in some ancient cyanobacteria. Luke Thompson/Chisholm Lab, Nikki Watson/Whitehead/MIT Share this: Email Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pocket Reddit Print By Tina Hesman Saey January 3, 2024 at 11:38 am Ancient tiny fossils from Australia may carry evidence of great power: the ability to make oxygen through photosynthesis. The fossilized bacteria, dating from 1.73 billion to 1.78 billion years ago, are chock-full of structures that resemble those where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place in most modern cyanobacteria and in plants. Called thylakoid membranes, the structures are the oldest ever found , researchers report January 3 in Nature . The finding pushes back the evidence of thylakoids in cyanobacteria by 1.2 billion years. Cyanobacteria’s invention of photosynthesis is responsible for the oxygen in Earth’s atmosphere. “So they’re a big deal,” says Woodward Fischer, a geobiologist at Caltech who was not involved finding the thylakoid membranes. And “this is the kind of information that I thought we were not going to be able to pull out of fossils,” he says. Most fossils preserve mineralized tissues such as bone or shells, but bacteria don’t contain such mineral structures. These fossils are “just compressions of carbon” squished into mud, Fischer says. To find the bacteria preserved is impressive enough, but the new fossils reveal complex structures inside the microscopic bacteria. “It suggests this kind of future where we might be able to pull more information, more cell biology and morphological detail out of these minuscule fossils,” he says. Researchers already had indirect evidence from genetics and chemical studies that cyanobacteria had developed thylakoids by the time these fossilized bacteria lived, says Patricia Sanchez-Baracaldo, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Bristol in England (SN: 9/8/15) . Still, exactly when the structures evolved is hotly debated ( SN: 3/2/17 ). So it’s exciting to see fossil evidence of such old thylakoids, says Sanchez-Baracaldo, who was not involved in the work. “Any evidence that you have from that time period is important because the fossil record is really very sparse.” Some researchers think that thylakoids may have evolved before the Great Oxidation Event around 2.4 billion years ago ( SN: 12/11/19 ). Prior to that event, there were whiffs of oxygen here and there in the atmosphere, but it took the concentrated action of photosynthetic bacteria to send Earth’s oxygen levels skyrocketing. Stacks of thylakoids within cyanobacteria may have multiplied the bacteria’s oxygen production. During the period when the now-fossilized cyanobacteria lived, oxygen levels in Earth’s atmosphere had plummeted again to a fraction of today’s levels, Sanchez-Baracaldo says. The fossils hint that there may have been small pockets where oxygen was abundant and could have fostered the evolution of the ancestors of plants and animals. Many rocks that might harbor such fossils have been compressed and “cooked” destroying delicate intracellular structures like thylakoids, says Emmanuelle Javaux, an astrobiologist at the University of Liège in Belgium. “We didn’t know that they could be preserved in such old microfossils,” she says. But she has no doubt that the dark lines stacked through tiny sausage-shaped cells represent thylakoids. “It cannot be something else, actually. This arrangement is very unique to cyanobacteria with thylakoids,” she says. Researchers found microscopic fossils of cyanobacteria dubbed Navifusa majensis (left) in 1.73 billion- to 1.78 billion-year-old shale from Australia). A peek inside the fossils revealed black horizontal lines indicating the bacterium contained stacks of membranes known as thylakoids (right) like those in modern bacteria and plants where oxygen-producing photosynthesis takes place.

C.F. Demoulin, et al ./ Nature 2024 Javaux and colleagues found the oldest thylakoid-like structures in microfossils in shale from Australia. The structures were also present in about 1 billion-year-old fossils from Canada, but not in 1 billion-year-old ones from Congo. The rocks from Congo experienced slightly higher temperatures than the others, which may have destroyed fossil evidence of thylakoids. Or maybe those fossils are cyanobacteria that never evolved the structures or are another type of microbe entirely. The researchers can’t tell from the fossils whether the Australian and Canadian cyanobacteria are direct ancestors of living species, Javaux says, but they are almost certainly cousins. The team hopes to investigate even older rocks from before the Great Oxidation Event for even more ancient evidence of thylakoids. Questions or comments on this article?

In a new podcast from OPB and ProPublica, follow the fight to save them through the voices of one Yakama Nation family. Listen now High temperatures send Oregonians to cool water, but state warns of toxic algae blooms By Kristian Foden-Vencil ( OPB ) Aug. 14, 2023 9:32 p.m. As Oregon temperatures reach triple digits, the Oregon Health Authority is warning people not to jump into rivers and lakes with toxic algae blooms. Cyanobacteria are blooming in nine Oregon bodies of water , from Hells Canyon Reservoir to Upper Klamath Lake and the South Umpqua River. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor In Portland, the Oregon Health Authority has placed advisories on the Willamette River near Ross Island Lagoo and Riverplace Marina. On Monday, it also extended an advisory at Willamette Cove downstream to near Cathedral Park. Essentially, the advisory covers much of downtown. Cyanobacteria are found in fresh and salt water all over the world. The bacteria can be beneficial by producing oxygen, but in warm weather, low water flows can lead to blooms that produce large amounts of cyanotoxins. Kylah Peterson cools off on the Willamette River on Monday, Aug. 14, 2023. The Oregon Health Authority has issued several warnings for toxic algae blooms in waterways across the state as temperatures reached into the triple digits. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB Kylah Peterson, a 26-year-old Portland resident, doesn’t have air conditioning, so she uses fans and window curtains to stay cool. On Monday, she visited Sellwood Park to dip her feet in the Willamette River, not far from one advisory area. “It’s definitely something to be concerned about,” Peterson said. “But I’m being very cautious and just keeping my feet in.” As a veterinary assistant, Peterson was also keeping an eye out for dogs running in and out of the river. Dogs and other animals, including cats, horses, birds and humans, are susceptible to cyanotoxins. They can enter the body when contaminated water is ingested. The toxins can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation to liver and kidney damage. Symptoms generally begin within 24 hours and last 72 hours. For pets, they can sometimes be fatal. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor The number of algae blooms in Oregon has increased over the last decade. Peterson blamed the rise in temperatures resulting from human-caused climate change. “It kind of makes me sad because I’ve lived here for a while and these heat waves weren’t what I grew up with. It does seem like climate change is happening,” she said. “I kind of miss how it was, but we’ve got to move forward and this is how it is now.” Willie Levenson, head of the Human Access Project , a nonprofit dedicated to getting more people to swim in the Willamette River, agrees that climate change has increased local algae blooms. But, he said, things can be done to reduce the number of blooms. For example, Ross Island Lagoon sits on an island. It’s where Ross Island Sand and Gravel have dug aggregate for concrete for 100 years. As a result, there’s a pool 130 feet deep, where water from the Willamette River backwaters sits and warms, causing an algae bloom. Levenson and his group are trying to secure federal funding so they can pay to dig a channel that would move more river water through the lagoon, cooling the water and reducing algae blooms. “The harmful algae bloom forms inside of the lagoon and then winds and tides blow it out into the channel. Then it migrates into the mainstem of the river,” Levenson said. Levenson said the Willamette River should be viewed as a natural cooling station that people need when temperatures rise, rather than a potential threat to their health. For anyone visiting the water in this week’s heat, they should take cyanobacteria seriously, he said. “Harmful algae bloom is a very serious issue. I mean it’s probably the biggest issue in Portland that people aren’t aware of.” When he swims, which is about four times a week, Levenson makes sure the water is moving relatively quickly, and that there are no green flecks floating on the surface.

The sheer magnitude of the October 2021 die-off, when hundreds, possibly thousands, of herring washed up, is what sticks in the minds of the residents of Kotzebue, Alaska. Fish were “literally all over the beaches,” says Bob Schaeffer, a fisherman and elder from the Qikiqtaġruŋmiut tribe. Despite the dramatic deaths, there was no apparent culprit. “We have no idea what caused it,” says Alex Whiting, the environmental program director for the Native Village of Kotzebue. He wonders if the die-off was a symptom of a problem he’s had his eye on for the past 15 years: blooms of toxic cyanobacteria, sometimes called blue-green algae, that have become increasingly noticeable in the waters around this remote Alaska town. Kotzebue sits about 40 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, on Alaska’s western coastline. Before the Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue had his name attached to the place in the 1800s, the region was called Qikiqtaġruk, meaning “place that is almost an island.” One side of the two-kilometer-long settlement is bordered by Kotzebue Sound, an offshoot of the Chukchi Sea, and the other by a lagoon. Planes, boats, and four-wheelers are the main modes of transportation. The only road out of town simply loops around the lagoon before heading back in. Kotzebue, Alaska, about 40 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle, is in the Qikiqtaġruk region and home to the Qikiqtaġruŋmiut tribe.

Alaska Natives, who make up about three-quarters of Kotzebue’s population, pull hundreds of kilograms of food out of the sea every year. “We’re ocean people,” Schaeffer tells me. The two of us are crammed into the tiny cabin of Schaeffer’s fishing boat in the just-light hours of a drizzly September 2022 morning. We’re motoring toward a water-monitoring device that’s been moored in Kotzebue Sound all summer. On the bow, Ajit Subramaniam, a microbial oceanographer from Columbia University, New York, Whiting, and Schaeffer’s son Vince have their noses tucked into upturned collars to shield against the cold rain. We’re all there to collect a summer’s worth of information about cyanobacteria that might be poisoning the fish Schaeffer and many others depend on. The climate is changing, and our journalists are here to help you make sense of it. Sign up for our weekly email newsletter and never miss a story. Huge colonies of algae are nothing new, and they’re often beneficial. In the spring, for example, increased light and nutrient levels cause phytoplankton to bloom, creating a microbial soup that feeds fish and invertebrates. But unlike many forms of algae, cyanobacteria can be dangerous. Some species can produce cyanotoxins that cause liver or neurological damage, and perhaps even cancer, in humans and other animals. Many communities have fallen foul of cyanobacteria. Although many cyanobacteria can survive in the marine environment, freshwater blooms tend to garner more attention, and their effects can spread to brackish environments when streams and rivers carry them into the sea. In East Africa, for example, blooms in Lake Victoria are blamed for massive fish kills. People can also suffer: in an extreme case in 1996, 26 patients died after receiving treatment at a Brazilian hemodialysis center, and an investigation found cyanotoxins in the clinic’s water supply. More often, people who are exposed experience fevers, headaches, or vomiting. When phytoplankton blooms decompose, whole ecosystems can take a hit. Rotting cyanobacteria rob the waters of oxygen, suffocating fish and other marine life. In the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea, cyanobacterial blooms contribute to deoxygenation of the deep water and harm the cod industry. Green algae blooms swirling around the Baltic Sea.

Whiting’s cyanobacteria story started in 2008. One day while riding his bike home from work, he came across an arresting site: Kotzebue Sound had turned chartreuse, a color unlike anything he thought existed in nature. His first thought was, Where’s this paint coming from? The story of cyanobacteria on this planet goes back about 1.9 billion years , however. As the first organisms to evolve photosynthesis, they’re often credited with bringing oxygen to Earth’s atmosphere, clearing the path for complex life forms such as ourselves. Over their long history, cyanobacteria have evolved tricks that let them proliferate wildly when shifts in conditions such as nutrient levels or salinity kill off other microbes. “You can think of them as sort of the weedy species,” says Raphael Kudela, a phytoplankton ecologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Most microbes, for example, need a complex form of nitrogen that is sometimes only available in limited quantities to grow and reproduce, but the predominant cyanobacteria in Kotzebue Sound can use a simple form of nitrogen that’s found in virtually limitless quantities in the air. Cyanotoxins are likely another tool that help cyanobacteria thrive, but researchers aren’t sure exactly how toxins benefit these microbes. Some scientists think they deter organisms that eat cyanobacteria, such as bigger plankton and fish. Hans Paerl, an aquatic ecologist from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, favors another hypothesis: that toxins shield cyanobacteria from the potentially damaging astringent byproducts of photosynthesis. Around the time when Kotzebue saw its first bloom, scientists were realizing that climate change would likely increase the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms, and what’s more, that blooms could spread from fresh water—long the focus of research—into adjacent brackish water. Kotzebue Sound’s blooms probably form in a nearby lake before flowing into the sea. The latest science on cyanobacteria, however, had not reached Kotzebue in 2008. Instead, officers from the Alaska Department of Fish and Game tested the chartreuse water for petroleum and its byproducts. The tests came back negative, leaving Whiting stumped. “I had zero idea,” he says. It was biologist Lisa Clough, then from East Carolina University and now with the National Science Foundation, with whom Whiting had previously collaborated, who suggested he consider cyanobacteria. The following year, water sample analysis confirmed she was correct. In 2017, Subramaniam visited Kotzebue as part of a research team studying sea ice dynamics. When Whiting learned that Subramaniam had a long-standing interest in cyanobacteria, “we just immediately clicked,” Subramaniam says.

Photo by Saima Sidik The 2021 fish kill redoubled Whiting and Subramaniam’s enthusiasm for understanding how Kotzebue Sound’s microbial ecosystem could affect the town. A pathologist found damage to the dead fish’s gills, which may have been caused by the hard, spiky shells of diatoms (a type of algae), but the cause of the fish kill is still unclear. With so many of the town’s residents depending on fish as one of their food sources, that makes Subramaniam nervous. “If we don’t know what killed the fish, then it’s very difficult to address the question of, Is it safe to consume?” he says. I watch the latest chapter of their collaboration from a crouched position on the deck of Schaeffer’s precipitously swaying fishing boat. Whiting reassures me that the one-piece flotation suit I’m wearing will save my life if I end up in the water, but I’m not keen to test that theory. Instead, I hold onto the boat with one hand and the phone I’m using to record video with the other while Whiting, Subramaniam, and Vince Schaeffer haul up a white-and-yellow contraption they moored in the ocean, rocking the boat in the process. Finally, a metal sphere about the diameter of a hula hoop emerges. From it projects a meter-long tube that contains a cyanobacteria sensor. The sensor allows Whiting and Subramaniam to overcome a limitation that many researchers face: a cyanobacterial bloom is intense but fleeting, so “if you’re not here at the right time,” Subramaniam explains, “you’re not going to see it.” In contrast to the isolated measurements that researchers often rely on, the sensor had taken a reading every 10 minutes from the time it was deployed in June to this chilly September morning. By measuring levels of a fluorescent compound called phycocyanin, which is found only in cyanobacteria, they hope to correlate these species’ abundance with changes in water qualities such as salinity, temperature, and the presence of other forms of plankton. Whiting, Subramaniam, and Vince Schaeffer, son of the boat’s captain, Bob Schaeffer, deploy the water-monitoring equipment. Information gathered from the device will help determine the conditions in which cyanobacteria tend to bloom. Photo by Saima Sidik Researchers are enthusiastic about the work because of its potential to protect the health of Alaskans, and because it could help them understand why blooms occur around the world. “That kind of high resolution is really valuable,” says Malin Olofsson, an aquatic biologist from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, who studies cyanobacteria in the Baltic Sea. By combining phycocyanin measurements with toxin measurements, the scientists hope to provide a more complete picture of the hazards facing Kotzebue, but right now Subramaniam’s priority is to understand which species of cyanobacteria are most common and what’s causing them to bloom. Farrugia, from the Alaska Harmful Algal Bloom Network, is excited about the possibility of using similar methods in other parts of Alaska to gain an overall view of where and when cyanobacteria are proliferating. Showing that the sensor works in one location “is definitely the first step,” he says. Understanding the location and potential source of cyanobacterial blooms is only half the battle: the other question is what to do about them. In the Baltic Sea, where fertilizer runoff from industrial agriculture has exacerbated blooms, neighboring countries have put a lot of effort into curtailing that runoff—and with success, Olofsson says. Kotzebue is not in an agricultural area, however, and instead some scientists have hypothesized that thawing permafrost may release nutrients that promote blooms. There’s not much anyone can do to prevent this, short of reversing the climate crisis. Some chemicals, including hydrogen peroxide, show promise as ways to kill cyanobacteria and bring temporary relief from blooms without affecting ecosystems broadly, but so far chemical treatments haven’t provided permanent solutions. Instead, Whiting is hoping to create a rapid response system so he can notify the town if a bloom is turning water and food toxic. But this will require building up Kotzebue’s research infrastructure. At the moment, Subramaniam prepares samples in the kitchen at the Selawik National Wildlife Refuge’s office, then sends them across the country to researchers, who can take days, sometimes even months, to analyze them. To make the work safer and faster, Whiting and Subramaniam are applying for funding to set up a lab in Kotzebue and possibly hire a technician who can process samples in-house. Getting a lab is “probably the best thing that could happen up here,” says Schaeffer. Subramaniam is hopeful that their efforts will pay off within the next year. In the meantime, interest in cyanobacterial blooms is also popping up in other regions of Alaska. Emma Pate, the training coordinator and environmental planner for the Norton Sound Health Corporation, started a monitoring program after members of local tribes noticed increased numbers of algae in rivers and streams. In Utqiaġvik, on Alaska’s northern coast, locals have also started sampling for cyanobacteria, Farrugia says. Whiting sees this work as filling a critical hole in Alaskans’ understanding of water quality. Regulatory agencies have yet to devise systems to protect Alaskans from the potential threat posed by cyanobacteria, so “somebody needs to do something,” he says. “We can’t all just be bumbling around in the dark waiting for a bunch of people to die.” Perhaps this sense of self-sufficiency, which has let Arctic people thrive on the frozen tundra for millennia, will once again get the job done.

The problem seems to be growing in the Granite State and happening earlier in the summer. But it comes at a time when a legislatively appointed committee is finishing a draft report on how to deal with it and included in the upcoming biennial budget is $1 million to create a mitigation loan and grant fund. Kate Hastings, state cyanobacteria program coordinator, said the Department of Environmental Services issued six cyanobacteria advisories in May this year, which broke the previous record of five in 2010. Last week, 10 advisories were issued warning people to stay out of certain water bodies across the state. Previously known as “blue-green algae” cyanobacteria is naturally occurring in the state’s 1,000 lakes and ponds. “We are certainly seeing them earlier in the summer,” said Nisa Marks, watershed coordinator for the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on Tuesday. “We do expect an increase in reports,” this summer which could possibly be in part, due to increased public awareness but also related to weather. These blooms or scum which look like paint spills in the water have increased in number due in part to a warming climate, Marks acknowledged. Shorter winters with fewer ice-in days, the fact that surface water temperatures are increasing in the state and human-caused phosphorus introductions are factors. Cyanobacteria are fed by phosphorus introduced into the water and grow with warmth and sunlight. It can actually shift its height in the water column and a bloom usually lasts about three weeks. The draft report looks at an emphasis on nutrient reduction, improved reporting, and outreach. Sponsored by state Rep. Rosemarie Rung, D-Merrimack, and state Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, D-Lebanon,  House Bill 1066 in 2022 was overwhelmingly supported to create the 17-member Cyanobacteria Plan Advisory Committee and gave it $30,000 to create a report, “supported by scientific data” which “shall include measurable milestones,” and a state strategy to prevent the increase and eventually control cyanobacteria blooms. Indepth Your Inbox Get unbiased nonprofit watchdog news sent directly to your inbox. “My mantra is cyanobacteria is the biggest threat to New Hampshire that no one knows about,” Rung said. One of the biggest problems is 23 municipalities draw their drinking water from lakes’ and rivers’ surface water. Rung said Salem draws its municipal drinking from Arlington Mills Pond and Canobie Lake, switching between the two. And Arlington Mills Pond had cyanobacteria blooms for the past two years. “This is a complex issue. There is growing evidence that cyanobacteria is linked to neurological diseases like ALS,” Rung said. She is also concerned about people who rent vacation properties that have no idea that cyanobacteria blooms are becoming more frequent. The committee met throughout last fall and this spring and used $15,000 of its grant to get help from UNH and the other half with the New Hampshire Lakes Association for stakeholder outreach. A draft of the report is now in the process, Marks said, with the report due Nov. 1. A draft report is here https://nhlakes.org/wp-content/uploads/A1-The-Plan-to-Address-Cyanobacteria-Blooms.pdf One goal of the report is to look at budgetary recommendations and possible legislation as well as methods to better communicate with the recreating public. Marks said a finding from the study includes the fact that there is little funding to support veterinary analysis of the problem, though there is anecdotal evidence that cyanobacteria has killed dogs in New Hampshire, but there is no empirical data. Human impacts of cyanobacteria, include nausea, rash, and neurological issues but in pets and children, it can be deadly, Rung said. Today, the state has a regularly updated cyanobacteria mapper, https://www.des.nh.gov/water/healthy-swimming/healthy-swimming-mapper . You can sign up to follow on Twitter a report of cyanobacteria alerts and warnings/advisories across the state. And you can call the state with a suspected bloom report by calling 603-848-8094. For example, on Tuesday, there were cyanobacteria alerts for Mascoma Lake in Enfield, Lake Wentworth in Wolfeboro, Eastman Pond in Grantham and Enfield, and Lake Umbagog in Coos County and Oxford County, Maine. And warnings (advisories) for Pine River in Wakefield, Webster Lake in Franklin, Bow Lake in Strafford, and Lake Kanasatka in Moultonbough. Alerts are issued when there are signs that the cyanobacteria may become a problem with cell count concentrations below 70,000 counts per liter and advisories are a higher level of warning where the counts are above that threshold. Cyanobacteria blooms can reoccur. The draft report gives the example of Tucker Pond in Salisbury which in 2019 had a 14-day bloom in August. In 2022, it was back with a bloom that extended for 100 days, from August through November. The impacts are not only to health but to the regional economy from tourism, property values, and disruption of drinking water systems. Marks said any member of the public can report a bloom through the DES’s online bloom reporting form. “Look for discoloration or unusual growth prior to recreating or letting your pets in the water. If you see something unusual, take pictures and report it. When in doubt, stay out,” she said. Support In-Depth New Hampshire We depend on your support.

Beyond Trees: Using Blue-Green Algae for Natural Carbon Capture and Sequestration By Tina Casey May 17, 2023 Fun fact: Several species of flamingo get their pink color from a diet rich in cyanobacteria, but blue-green algae blooms aren't so fun for other wildlife. (Image:Â Elizabeth Gottwald /Unsplash)Â Forestation is an important climate action strategy, but more sophisticated â and potentially more efficient â nature-based alternatives are emerging. One of them involves an environmental two-for-one: capturing carbon by preventing destructive blue-green algae blooms. Cyanobacteria and algae blooms Blue-green algae is the common name for cyanobacteria, a type of water-dwelling bacteria that has plant-like photosynthetic abilities. An over-abundance or âbloomâ of cyanobacteria can wreck ecosystems and harm other living things. âA combination of environmental factors such as the presence of nutrients, warm temperatures, and lots of light encourage the natural increase in the numbers of cyanobacteria,â according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . In higher concentrations, the toxins produced by some cyanobacteria can damage the liver, nerves, and skin of humans and other creatures, including pets and livestock as well as wildlife. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency notes that warmer temperatures and other climate impacts affect the frequency and severity of algae blooms. Blue-green algae blooms in particular are a frequent occurrence in all 50 U.S. states and elsewhere in the world. They mainly occur on inland waters, but they can also happen in the open ocean.Â Putting âbadâ algae to good useÂ On the plus side, cyanobacteria are emerging as a clean technology jack-of-all-trades, partly because they are fast-growing, voracious consumers of carbon dioxide. Researchers have tweaked cyanobacteria to produce renewable hydrogen and other biofuels, for example. Cyanobacteria are also attracting attention for their ability to convert airborne carbon to a solid substance. They have been linked to deposits of the mineral carbonate, a salt of carbonic acid. The âbiomineralizationâ process carried out by cyanobacteria was formerly thought to occur as a result of outside factors. However, 2014 research concluded that some strains are capable of producing carbonate on their own. In 2020, researchers at the University of Colorado in Boulder put the biomineralization concept to work . They demonstrated that, under the right growing conditions, certain types of cyanobacteria can produce calcium carbonate, which happens to be the main ingredient in cement. The research team tested their method on a growing medium of sand and gelatin. As the cyanobacteria produced calcium carbonate, they mineralized the gelatin and bound the sand into a bio-manufactured brick. Blue-green algae blooms swirling around the Baltic Sea in 2019, as seen from space.Â (Image:Â European Space Agency /Flickr) Algae remediation and carbon offsets Regardless of the potential use cases for cyanobacteria-produced carbonate, algae blooms must be treated and prevented in order to protect aquatic habitats and human health. BlueGreen Water Technologies is among those developing algaecides that specifically tackle cyanobacteria. Its patented, EPA-approved formula triggers a natural âsuicideâ response in cyanobacteria, clearing the way for beneficial algae and other aquatic species to take over. The treatment effectively converts a body of water into a carbon sink, with the dead cyanobacteria locked into sediment for potentially millions of years, according to BlueGreen. This carbon-sequestering feature could help offset the cost of remediating blue-green algae blooms, if stakeholders could claim carbon credits for the operation. The challenge is to develop a methodology that produces a science-based estimate of the captured carbon. Scientific verification for cyanobacteria remediation In March, BlueGreen received approval from the Social Carbon Foundation for its carbon quantification methodology, under the proprietary name Net Blue. Social Carbon manages the trademarked greenhouse gas standard by the same name. âNet Blue is the first deep water, nature-based climate solution for atmospheric carbon removal that is regulatory approved, scientifically validated and, now, verifiable by industry standards,â BlueGreen asserted in a March announcement .Â The company has been remediating cyanobacteria since 2019, for an estimated 3.3 million tons of carbon removal. With the Social Carbon standard in hand, BlueGreen can now market cyanobacteria remediation as a verifiable carbon offset. According to BlueGreen CEO Eval Harel, the worldwide potential for cyanobacteria remediation offsets adds up to about 115 gigatons of carbon. A blue-green algae bloom in Regent's Canal just north of London in 2019.Â (Image: Marc Barrot /Flickr) Natural vs. unnatural carbon capture The emergence of verifiable cyanobacteria remediation credits should help meet the growing demand for carbon credits. The current demand for carbon credits already exceeds the supply, and BlueGreen projectsÂ a 15-fold increase in demand for carbon credits by 2030 and a 100-fold increase by 2050. Cyanobacteria remediation could also help further undercut the case for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CCS has been promoted as an effective pathway for preventing greenhouse gas emissions from coal power plants and other industrial sources. However, the idea of capturing carbon and storing it in underground formations is rapidly losing currency. BlueGreen offers a fast-acting, scalable carbon capture system that requires no infrastructure. The algaecide can be deployed swiftly to provide additional benefits for local businesses and recreational users, as well as restore biodiversity and protect public health. In contrast, carbon capture and storageÂ systems offer no such local add-on benefits, and their ability to scale up globally has yet to be proven. In particular, it is difficult to see how CCS infrastructure fits into the rapid decarbonization picture, due to its relatively high costs and long timeline for construction. Typically, CCS systems also require new pipelines to ship captured carbon from the source to a distant storage facility. That raises the threat of environmental impacts related to construction of the pipeline, as well as delays due to public opposition. The U.S. already has one massive carbon capture failure under its belt, the FutureGen CCS project in Illinois. It kicked off in 2003 with support from the U.S. Department of Energy, intended to provide a showcase for technology to capture and store carbon from a coal power plant. The project was abandoned in 2015. Since then, new alternatives have emerged in the field of carbon capture, utilization and storage systems (CCUS), which can convert captured carbon into new products that recycle or sequester it, at least temporarily. Recycled-carbon products also help reduce the need to draw virgin petrochemicals from underground. Fuels, fabrics, perfumes and vodka are among the new recycled-carbon products coming to market, made fromÂ carbon collected at industrial sources or drawn from ambient air by CCUS facilities. The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects CCUS activity to pick up considerably in the coming years , from just 35 systems in operation globally today to an estimated 200 in the pipeline by 2030.Â What about the trees? Despite all the forthcoming activity, IEA does not foresee CCUS playing a leading role in the effort to achieve a net-zero economy. âNeverthelessâ¦ CCUS deployment would remain substantially below what is required"" for a net-zero scenario, IEA concluded in a 2022 report. The need remains for a broad expansion of swift, effective decarbonization pathways across the board. The Social Carbon Foundation is among those working to steer the decarbonization conversation into a more holistic framework that can achieve global progress on a larger scale. Through its Social Carbon standard, the organization advocates for nature-based decarbonization pathways that, like BlueGreen, provide local benefits. The localized nature of this approach requires the standard to be flexible and take political and social elements into account. âProjects using our standard go beyond carbon, embedding meaningful social, environmental and economic benefits to the projects and their local stakeholders,â Social Carbon's website reads.Â âThe trademark communicates that emissions reductions result from efforts that benefit and improve living conditions for stakeholders involved in climate change projects, in ways that strengthen their welfare and civic consciousness without degrading their resources base,â it continues.Â That reference to resources appears to be a cautionary note against tree-planting programs that focus on commercial timber plantations as a carbon sequestration tool, to the detriment of local habitat. Scientists have also raised concerns about the pace and efficiency of carbon capture through forestation. Planting trees is likely to continue to hold a place in the carbon market, but companies seeking to burnish their reputation with forestation will need to ensure that their projects adopt a holistic approach that supports local communities .

Some species are responsible for catastrophic environmental events, called blooms, which have become increasingly common in lakes and freshwater bodies as a consequence of global changes. Genotypic diversity is considered essential for marine cyanobacterial population, allowing it to cope with spatio-temporal environmental variations and to adapt to specific micro-niches in the ecosystem. This aspect is underestimated in the study of bloom development, however, and given little notice in studies of the ecology of harmful cyanobacteria. Here we compared the genomes of four strains of Aphanizomenon gracile , a species of filamentous toxinogenic cyanobacteria (Nostocales) found worldwide in fresh and brackish water. Millimeter-sized fascicles were isolated from a single water sample and have been maintained in culture since 2010. A comparative study revealed extensive heterogeneity in gene contents, despite similar genome size and high similarity indices. These variations were mainly associated with mobile genetic elements and biosynthetic gene clusters. For some of the latter, metabolomic analysis confirmed the production of related secondary metabolites, such as cyanotoxins and carotenoids, which are thought to play a fundamental role in the cyanobacterial fitness. Altogether, these results demonstrated that an A. gracile bloom could be a highly diverse population at low spatial scale and raised questions about potential exchanges of essential metabolites between individuals. Introduction The ecological success of cyanobacteria is partly a result of the intra-specific diversity of ecotypes [ 1 , 2 , 3 ], groups of individuals sharing close growth optima for environmental factors such as temperature and light intensity, which allow the population to cope with spatiotemporal variations in their habitat. Phylogenetic inferences based on single ( e.g. , Internal Transcribed Spacer, ITS) or multiple genes allow to group these ecotype members within a clade, suggesting the selection for adaptative capabilities. In terms of gene content, however, the ecotypes can also show significant divergence from each other. For instance the gene sets involved in the phosphorus assimilation, an essential abiotic factor for cyanobacterial growth, diverge between ecotypes from P-rich or P-limited aquatic ecosystems [ 4 , 5 , 6 ]. For the well-studied cyanobacterial species Prochlorochoccus marinus (Synechococcales) and Microcystis aeruginosa (Chroococcales), a single ecotype can also contain many strains with distinct genotypes. This so-called microdiversity relies primarily in these species on a high genomic plasticity [ 7 ], driven in part by mobile genetic elements [ 7 , 8 , 9 ] and is assumed to be involved in individuals adaptation to specific micro-niches [ 10 ]. Aphanizomenon gracile is a nitrogen-fixing filamentous cyanobacterium able to form fascicles and is responsible for toxic blooms in freshwater and brackish aquatic ecosystems. It belongs to the order, Nostocales, about which no data are available on genetic intra-population diversity. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of four strains of A. gracile isolated from a single sample of water to question the intra-population diversity at low-spatial scale. Results and discussion We sequenced and assembled the genomes of four A. gracile strains (PMC627.10, PMC638.10, PMC644.10 and PMC649.10) firstly isolated from a single sample of water and maintained in monoculture (see Supplementary Methods). The resulting genomes displayed almost-perfect completeness (from 99.18% for PMC649.10 to 100% for PMC638.10), but were composed of numerous sequences, between 65 (PMC627.10) and 238 (PMC644.10), because of a large number of repeated sequences. The four genomes were very similar in size (5.40 ± 0.03 Mb), GC content (38.35 ± 0.05%) and number of tRNAs (from 40 to 42) (Table 1 ). Each strain shared with the others a minimal sequence similarity of 99.86% with the 16S rRNA coding gene, while the ITS sequences were all identical (Fig. S1 ). At the whole genome level, the proximity among strains was supported by pairwise ANI (Average Nucleotide Identity, Table 1 ) with values ≥99.12%. Such a level of similarity usually leads to the conclusion that related organisms belong to the same operational taxonomic unit and by extension to the same ecotype as the phylogenetically distant marine unicellular pico-cyanobacterium, Prochlorococcus marinus , in which microdiversity has been thoroughly studied [ 11 ]. In the absence of physiological data confirming the ecotypes of the A. gracile strains, these findings allow us to interpret the internal variability of the A. gracile strains in a microdiversity context. Table 1 Genomic features of A. gracile strains. Full size table Despite the absence of self-evident differences between genetic markers, comparative genomics revealed divergences among the strains. A striking representation of this is given by the low synteny index of 77.01 ± 1.31%, similar to those reported among 12 Microcystis aeruginosa strains sampled from distant geographical locations (76 ± 4%) [ 7 ]. As exemplified for PMC627.10, the variations of the synteny index along the genome were significantly associated with the COGs frequency distribution (Pearson’s chi-squared test, p < 2.2e −16 ) meaning that the low synteny was due to the presence or absence of strain-specific genes rather than intra-genomic rearrangements (Fig. 1a ). In total, among the 5911 COGs predicted in all genomes (4972 ± 28 per strain; Table 1 ), the core genome was represented by only 67.97% of them (4018) (Fig. 1b ). The accessory gene fraction consisted of almost half (48.54%) singletons, i.e. , strain-specific genes (between 192 and 305 by genome). The latter fraction was significantly enriched in genes encoding prokaryotic defense systems and transposases. These subcategories of “Replication, Recombination and Repair” (COG category L) as well as Orphans ( t test H 0 : no difference, p < 0.01) are usually considered as markers of mobile genetic elements, here potentially involved in genomic plasticity in Aphanizomenon . Remarkably, COGs related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (COG category Q) were also enriched in accessory fractions (Fig. 1c ).

Right: histogram displaying the number of BGCs by strain colored by BGC type. NRPS/PKS non-ribosomal peptide synthetase/polyketide synthetase, RiPPs ribosomally synthesized, post-translationally modified peptides, terpenes and others (uncharacterized). The lists of BGC and analytes detected in each strain can be found in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 , respectively. Full size image The study of A. gracile secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) revealed that their repertoires were unique to each A. gracile strain, with only 8 BGCs common to all strains out of a total of 22 distinct BGC characterized in these genomes (Fig. 1d ). Although variable, the composition of this BGC set appeared to be clade-associated in the Nostocales tree, as the number of BGCs in common with A. gracile genomes decreased with increasing distance from their clade in the phylogenetic tree. Accessory BGCs were notably involved in the production of carotenoids and shinorines, both implicated in several adaptative processes including photoprotection [ 12 , 13 ], and cyanotoxins ( e.g. puwainaphycins and saxitoxins), whose production in the associated cultures was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry (Fig. S2 , Table S3 ). Although not-well characterized, cyanotoxins are thought to play key roles in adaptation, given the high cost of BGC maintenance in genomes and resource requirements for their production. For example, saxitoxins, which were only synthesized in our study by PMC 627.10 and PMC 638.10 strains from synthesized from their 26.5kb long BGC, are presumed to regulate Na + homeostasis and have been proved to be actively extracellularly exported in salinity stress conditions [ 14 ]. Lastly, the group of accessory genes with resolutive functional annotations at the gene name level, revealed potential discrepancies in important metabolic pathways, such as sulfur metabolism and regulation of photosynthesis, although they did not belong to the COG categories enriched in the flexible fraction (Supplementary Results and Table S4 ). After ten years in culture, genetic drift could be responsible to some extent for the observed genomic diversity among strains (e.g., [ 15 ]). However, because the number of proteins in the pangenome is much higher than that of individual A. gracile strains, which is constrained by their genome size, this diversity probably reflects true genomic diversity in the natural population, as has already been observed at the level of individual marker genes, such as sxtA [ 16 ]. Our results lead to the conclusion that the intra-population micro-diversity could be a feature largely shared within the cyanobacterial phylum. On the one hand, the presence of accessory genes related to the regulation of photosynthesis and sulfur metabolism implies that many strains with diverse adaptive capabilities can thrive until bloom development and co-occur at low spatial scale. On the other hand, the inter-strain variability in the production of essential secondary metabolites for which biosynthetic genes are especially enriched in accessory gene fraction, suggests that some of these molecules could be shared to the surrounding cyanobacteria by the producing strains, allowing the population to benefit from their adaptive functions while limiting the resource requirements for individuals. Thus, evaluation of the extent of biodiversity within a blooming cyanobacteria population could be a cornerstone for the establishment of a holistic theoretical framework of the dynamics of toxinogenic cyanobacteria blooms.

Photo courtesy the Vermont health Department With summer swimming season in full swing and beach closures already announced for locations along Lake Champlain, state health and environmental officials say it’s a good time to know what cyanobacteria blooms look like in order to avoid them. Cyanobacteria blooms can be harmful to humans and pets. Also referred to as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria are tiny microorganisms that are a natural part of freshwater ecosystems. Under certain conditions, cyanobacteria multiply quickly, creating blooms on the water’s surface that can also wash up along shorelines. Blooms can produce toxins harmful to humans and animals. “Take a quick scan of the water before you, your kids or your pets go in,” said Bridget O’Brien, an environmental health scientist with the Vermont Department of Health. “If you see any scummy or discolored water – or if you are unsure – play it safe and find another place.” Swimming or wading in water with a cyanobacteria bloom may cause skin rashes, diarrhea, a sore throat, stomach problems, or more serious health concerns. Children and pets are most at risk. Children tend to play along the shore where cyanobacteria accumulate and may ingest water when they swim. And dogs may drink the water, lick bloom residue off their fur, and eat cyanobacteria scum from the shore. “We can all safely enjoy Vermont’s lakes and ponds if we learn to recognize and avoid contact with cyanobacteria,” said Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner John Beling. “If you think you see a bloom, be sure to report it.” Vermonters can report cyanobacteria blooms using an online form that also allows for easy upload of photos. These reports are reviewed by staff from the Health Department, Lake Champlain Committee or Department of Environmental Conservation. Confirmed reports, along with location and any photos, are posted online on the Cyanobacteria Tracker site. The Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation work closely with the Lake Champlain Committee to keep tabs on lakeshore conditions. For the past 20 years, the Lake Champlain Committee has trained community volunteers to monitor for cyanobacteria. These volunteer monitors, along with municipal recreational staff, as well as the Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation, provide data about where blooms are currently present, which get posted on the Health Department’s Cyanobacteria Tracker . This 2011 Health Department file photo shows a blue-green algae or cyanobacteria bloom along the lake shoreline at Sandbar State Park. Other photos online show green lake organisms that are not blue-green algae. Health Department file photo Although the tracker notes the locations of recently reported blooms, O’Brien cautions Vermonters not to rely on the map alone.  “Bloom conditions can and do change quickly, so it is still important to check the water when you get there. And be sure to pay attention to any posted signs warning of blooms or beach closures,” she said. If you think you see a cyanobacteria bloom, avoid contact with the water and do not let pets or livestock swim in or drink the water. Also, state officials ask that you report the bloom .  And if, despite your best efforts to avoid it you come in contact with cyanobacteria, health experts say to rinse off thoroughly as soon as possible and to talk with your healthcare provider.

The algae bloom led to the closure of parts of a marina and health warnings in neighboring counties. Swirls and tendrils of blue-green algae can be seen in this image, acquired on June 12, 2023, by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 . Around this time, a NOAA analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite data indicated that algae blooms covered about 380 square miles of the lake. That equates to more than half the area of the lake. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are single-celled organisms that rely on photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. The bacteria grow swiftly when nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen are abundant in still water. The bloom pictured here may contain blue-green algae, as well as other types of phytoplankton; only a surface sample can confirm the exact composition of a bloom. Some cyanobacteria produce microcystin —a potent toxin that can irritate the skin and cause liver and kidney damage. Microcystin was found in water samples taken from the lake on June 17 (five days after the image was acquired), including near the floodgate and canal used to release water into the St. Lucie Estuary on Florida’s southeastern coast. Excess lake water is typically released into the estuary and to farmlands to the south. But in mid-June, amid high lake levels, water managers prevented discharge because of the presence of harmful algae, according to the Miami Herald . The Florida Department of Health in Lee , Martin , and Palm Beach counties issued public health warnings in late June and early July, cautioning residents not to swim or boat in the lake due to the presence of harmful algal toxins. The harmful bloom grew to cover 420 square miles on July 4, and spanned 440 square miles by July 11. NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey .

Soon, however, a 3D-printed material that incorporates the microbes could be used to help purify polluted water – and after the bacteria are finished, they'll kill themselves. Developed by a team of scientists at the University of California San Diego, the material is made of a seaweed-derived natural polymer known as alginate, which is combined with live Synechococcus elongatus cyanobacteria. The resulting hydrogel is printed in a waffle-like grid pattern with a high surface-area-to-volume ratio. This configuration boosts the survival of the bacteria by placing most of the microbes near the surface of the gel where they can more easily access life-sustaining nutrients, gases and sunlight. Importantly, the cyanobacteria has been genetically engineered to produce an enzyme called laccase. Previous studies have shown how laccase is able to break down waterborne pollutants such as bisphenol A (BPA), antibiotics, pharmaceutical drugs and dyes. In lab tests, the new material successfully neutralized indigo carmine, which is a toxic dye commonly used in the production of denim blue jeans. Of course, no one wants genetically engineered cyanobacteria lingering in the environment after the job is done. With that fact in mind, the microbes have additionally been engineered to produce a protein that destroys their single-cell bodies, when they're exposed to a natural chemical known as theophylline. That said, because theophylline isn't native to aquatic environments, no one likely wants it making its way into their lakes or rivers, either. The scientists are therefore now looking into engineering the bacteria in such a way that its self-destruction could be triggered by stimuli already present in the environment. ""We’re excited about the possibilities that this work can lead to, the exciting new materials we can create,"" said Prof. Jon Pokorski, who co-led the study. ""This is the kind of research that can result when researchers with cross-disciplinary expertise in materials and biological sciences join forces.""

84,https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/oregon-state-researchers-develop-novel-technique-sniffing-out-toxic-algae-blooms,Oregon State researchers develop novel technique for sniffing out toxic algae blooms - Oregon State University,"Skip to main content OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY Open search box Life at OSU » Newsroom Toggle menu Go to search page Search Field Exit Search For Journalists For Faculty and Staff Contacts News Archive 2023 Top 10 Stories For Journalists For Faculty and Staff Contacts News Archive 2023 Top 10 Stories Oregon State researchers develop novel technique for sniffing out toxic algae blooms August 17, 2023 CORVALLIS, Ore. – Researchers at Oregon State University have developed a new way to monitor the danger associated with algae blooms: “sniffing” the water for gases associated with toxins. The scientists found that certain combinations of volatile organic compounds released by algae can serve as indicator for microcystin , a toxin produced at varying levels during blooms of cyanobacteria , commonly known as blue-green algae. Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, said OSU’s Kimberly Halsey, who led the study. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Even though the research dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, said Halsey, associate professor of microbiology in the College of Science. She said the study published today in mSystems describes “a very creative new approach that’s better and less expensive than current monitoring methods and also has broader implications.” “This work suggests that VOCs might be used to indicate other important environmental shifts, like the onset of oxygen deficiencies in aquatic systems or domoic acid contamination in coastal ecosystems,” Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. VOCs are any of a number of carbon-containing chemicals with a high tendency to exist in their gaseous state. VOCs released by cyanobacteria seem to reveal the physiological status of the algae during toxic blooms, Halsey said. “One reason VOCs could be such great targets for monitoring is their volatility,” she said. “Ideally we’ll someday be able to sniff the air above the lake with instruments and see which gases are there during cyanobacterial blooms.” Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms ubiquitous in all types of water around the globe. They use sunlight to make their own food and in warm, nutrient-rich environments can quickly multiply, resulting in blooms that spread across the water’s surface. These harmful algal blooms , often abbreviated to HABs, can form at any time of the year but most typically happen between spring and fall. An HAB in 2018 fouled drinking water in Oregon’s capital city of Salem, and in 2007 a national survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found microcystin, a recognized liver toxin and potential liver carcinogen, in one out of every three lakes that were sampled. Annual economic losses attributed to cyanobacterial HABs in the United States alone are conservatively valued at $2-4 billion, say the researchers, who add that the severity and consequences of the blooms are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. “That means we need new and innovative monitoring for cyanobacteria and their toxins,” Halsey said. “It’s super expensive to measure toxins directly, especially when a waterway needs to be sampled and tested weekly over the course of an entire summer.” Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, Halsey said. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Halsey, microbiology graduate student Lindsay Collart and associate professor of statistics Duo Jiang worked with two years of water samples from eight locations on and near Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon. The lake is important for agriculture and recreation, for tribal subsistence and culture, and for fish and wildlife, Halsey notes, but its water quality has declined over the last 50 years from intensive farming and drought. Upper Klamath Lake is one of many Oregon lakes affected by cyanobacterial HABs each year, but not all of the blooms result in toxic levels of microcystin, and the onset and levels of toxin production have been largely unpredictable. “The algae cells are always producing a little bit of microcystin, and it serves a good purpose in the cell – it helps combat stress,” Halsey said. “But the cells can reach a tipping point of over-reliance on microcystin and that’s when levels in the water become toxic.” Analyzing the dissolved gases in the water samples – 227 VOCs in all – the scientists were able to determine subsets of them that were associated with different levels of microcystin in the water. Statistical analysis of the VOC subsets does a better job predicting toxin levels than currently used techniques like assessing water color and measuring cell count, Halsey said. “Now that we know these particular subsets of compounds are predictors of toxicity, maybe we only need to measure those,” she said. Even though the study dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. Halsey said the study also showed that VOCs can be used to paint a general picture of community composition – i.e., the relative abundance of cyanobacteria to other microbes in the system – which she describes as potentially “another piece of the prediction puzzle.” The Oregon State College of Science and the OSU Agricultural Research Foundation supported this research.

Are they dangerous? - The Providence Journal,"News Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Food Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals ENVIRONMENT Toxic blue-green algae bloom warnings issued in RI. Where they are and what to know Katie Landeck The Providence Journal Rhode Island is reporting its second blue-green algae bloom, also known as cyanobacteria, of the season. The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (RIDEM) are advising people to stay out of Tiogue Lake in Coventry , a popular fishing and swimming spot, after routine testing found high concentrations of cyanobacteria toxins in the water. On June 5, an advisory was issued for Almy Pond in Newport. The algae blooms release toxins that are harmful to humans and animals, particularly children. The agencies say that it's possible blooms are starting in other water bodies in the state. Here's what to know and what to look for. What is a blue-green algae bloom? Blue-green algae is naturally found in many freshwater ecosystems and is actually a bacteria, not a true algae. This cyanobacteria thrives in warm, nutrient-rich waters. ""A combination of excess nutrients (particularly phosphorus), sunlight, and high temperatures can lead to a rapid increase in blue-green algae, which is called a 'bloom,'"" said Jane Sawyers, the DEM supervising environmental scientist program supervisor, in an email. These blooms can have toxins in them, toxins that can only be determined through laboratory testing. Rather than take the risk, DEM recommends on its website that people stay out of any water that looks like it could be having a blue-green algae bloom. Look for water that looks like pea soup, green cottage cheese or like green paint has been spilled across the top of it. The blooms can also produce a swampy odor. ""People are advised to avoid contact with waterbodies that exhibit bright green coloration in the water or at the water surface and/or dense floating algal mats that form on the water's surface,"" the press release said. The toxins can linger in the water even after the bloom is no longer visible, according to the press release. Is it safe to swim in blue-green algae? Kayak? Fish? Can my dog swim in it? No, no, no and no, according to the Rhode Island Department of Health. RIDOH recommends people avoid fishing, boating, kayaking and definitely swimming in bodies of water where a blue-green algae advisory is in effect. The water is also harmful to animals, so you shouldn't allow your dog (or other pets) to drink or swim in the water. What are the symptoms of blue-green algae exposure? What should you do if exposed? If your skin comes in contact with cyanobacteria, RIDOH says you might experience skin, nose, eyes and/or throat irritation. If you ingest water with algal toxins you might experience: Stomach ache Diarrhea Vomiting Nausea Dizziness Headache Fever Liver damage Nervous system damage The last five points on the list are rarer. However, ""young children and pets are at a particular risk for health effects associated with algal toxins,"" according to the press release. People who experience these symptoms should talk to their doctor. If you come into contact with water you are suspicious of, rinse your skin with clean water as soon as possible, and when you get home take a shower and wash your clothes. If your pet comes in contact with the water, wash them with clean water as soon as possible and do not let them lick their fur. If within a day of being in contact with the water, your pet show loss of energy, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, or any unexplained sickness, contact your veterinarian. How common are blue-green algae blooms? With cyanobacteria naturally occurring in many freshwater ecosystems, they're fairly common. DEM monitors 17 lakes, ponds and reservoirs on a bi-weekly basis, and last year ended up checking 22 bodies of water. In 2022, 19 blue-green algae advisories were issued in Rhode Island. The same number was issued in 2021, and there were 17 in 2020, 14 in 2019, and 16 in 2018, according to RIDEM stats. During the last four years, the first advisory was issued in mid-June, and there are usually blooms reported through the end of the year. As the days get longer and warmer, the blooms become more likely, Sawyers said, noting the blooms usually peak in late summer and early fall. ""It’s very weather and waterbody dependent,"" Sawyers wrote. ""As the climate is warming and weather patterns changing, research indicates that Rhode Island, along with other states and countries, will likely see more blooms, given that blue-green algae bloom compete well in warmer, nutrient-laden waters."" How long does a blue-green algae bloom last? There is no way to estimate the length of a bloom, according to Sawyers. ""Blue-green algae blooms can be temporary (lasting a few days) to several months,"" she wrote. Poisonous plants in RI: How to ID and symptoms to watch for For reference, last year an advisory for Tiogue Lake was issued on June 27 and lifted on July 15. The Almy Pond bloom last year lasted from June 10 to December 15. How do I report a bloom?

A bloom of blue-green algae once again covered parts of the lake in September 2023. Located in Manitoba, Canada, the long lake has a watershed that spans one million square kilometers (386,000 square miles), draining some of Canada’s agricultural land. The lake consists of a large, deep north basin and a smaller, comparatively shallow south basin. Swirls of algae filled the south basin of the lake on September 25, 2023, when the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 acquired this image. Around this time, satellite observations analyzed by Environment and Climate Change Canada indicated that algae covered about 8,400 square kilometers (3,200 square miles), or about a third of the lake’s area. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are single-celled organisms that rely on photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. The bacteria grow swiftly when nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen are abundant in still water. The bloom pictured here may contain blue-green algae, as well as other types of phytoplankton; only a surface sample can confirm the exact composition of a bloom. Some cyanobacteria produce microcystin —a potent toxin that can irritate the skin and cause liver and kidney damage. While algae are part of a natural freshwater ecosystem, excess algae, particularly cyanobacteria, can be a nuisance to residents and tourists using the lake and its beaches for fishing, swimming, and recreation. Beaches in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg can get as many as 30,000 visitors a day during the summer months. Water samples taken at Winnipeg Beach on the west shore found that cyanobacteria levels were elevated in August , and visitors were advised to avoid swimming and fishing if green scum was visible. The health of Lake Winnipeg has been in decline in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2000, phosphorous concentrations in the lake almost doubled and algae blooms proliferated, both in terms of occurrence and extent. The major contributors to the influx of phosphorous to the lake were increased agricultural activities in the watershed and a higher frequency of flooding, which has increased runoff into the lake. Phosphorus concentrations are almost three times higher in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg, compared to the north basin. A 2019 study using data from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite found that the chlorophyll-a concentrations, which are used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, were on average more than twice as high in the south basin, compared to the north.

													the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked proofread Do cyanobacteria make the neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine? by 										 KeAi Communications Co. Chemical structures of β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) (A) and 4-diaminobutyric acid (DAB) (B). Credit: Cheng-Cai Zhang β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA), a non-protein amino acid initially discovered in Cycas in 1967, has gained attention for its potential association with neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Cyanobacteria are thought to be responsible for BMAA production, and a hypothesis suggests it accumulates in the brain tissue of flying foxes and humans through the food chain , possibly contributing to higher neurodegenerative disease rates among Guam's Indigenous population. However, controversy surrounds both BMAA production and its role in neurodegenerative diseases due to conflicting data and ongoing disputes over BMAA detection in biological samples , including cyanobacteria . The absence of a standardized detection method compounds the issue, with inconsistent results even from identical methods across different laboratories. ""Believers can detect BMAA in all samples, while non-believers found none and remain skeptical,"" says Cheng-Cai Zhang, co-corresponding author of a new study published in Water Biology and Security . Interestingly, the authors had previously demonstrated the toxicity of BMAA to various cyanobacterial species, a finding that appeared contradictory to these organisms' ability to produce this compound. In their recent study, the researchers created an amino acid transport mutant incapable of absorbing BMAA. ""Using this mutant as a control, we observed that the detection method effectively identified BMAA when cells took up the compound. However, in the absence of externally added BMAA, no signal for BMAA was detectable,"" shared Zhang. This approach served to validate their detection method, demonstrating its sensitivity comparable to that reported in existing literature. However, the team encountered a signal that closely resembled BMAA but was, in fact, identified as DAB, a commonly occurring BMAA isomer. ""When we applied this highly sensitive method to a broad collection of laboratory-cultured strains and natural cyanobacterial bloom samples, none of them yielded detectable levels of BMAA,"" said Zhang. These new findings, in conjunction with BMAA's known toxicity, raises significant doubts regarding its cyanobacterial origin. They also underscore the importance of incorporating single ion chromatograms for distinguishing BMAA from DAB or other isomers in future BMAA research.

M. K. Faluweki et al . [ 1 ] M. K. Faluweki et al . [ 1 ] × Cyanobacteria were Earth’s first photosynthetic organisms, and they remain important members of the planet’s ecosystem. Like flocks of birds and schools of fish, they are also natural examples of a type of out-of-equilibrium ensemble known to physicists as active matter. Mixon Faluweki of Nottingham Trent University in the UK and his colleagues have now applied the tools and concepts of statistical physics to investigate how members of one cyanobacteria species congregate [ 1 ]. The researchers found that a minimal model can account for the variety of structures they observed. The study of active matter began in the 1990s when researchers modeled systems of self-propelled, interacting point particles. Since then, ever-more complex systems have come under scrutiny, including long, flexible biological particles such as the Oscillatoria lutea cyanobacteria studied by Faluweki and his colleagues. In its natural, freshwater setting, O. lutea forms flexible filaments, 1–2 mm long, each comprising hundreds of individual cyanobacteria. Those filaments slide over each other in bundles that aggregate into net-like configurations. To investigate this behavior, Faluweki and his colleagues first monitored lab-grown colonies of O. lutea under a confocal microscope. Their measurements informed the next step: creating a model with a modest number of parameters to describe the aggregation of O. lutea . The model reproduced the variety of density-dependent structures that the researchers observed. It also yielded a physical explanation for the characteristic length of the web-like patterns emerging from the chains’ movement in terms of the relative importance of advective and diffusive transport. The team’s work could help elucidate the self-organization of other multicellular filamentary organisms, such as fossilized archaea and the cyanobacteria that are cultured in modern algal bioreactors. –Charles Day Charles Day is a Senior Editor for Physics Magazine .

(Mark Wallheiser/FAMU-FSU College of Engineering) A new project led by Nasrin Alamdari, an assistant professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the FAMU-FSU College of Engineering, will help communities throughout Florida fight the harmful blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) that plague freshwater lakes across the state. Florida’s freshwater systems sometimes experience cyanobacteria blooms that are harmful to public health and wildlife. Knowing where they might occur next gives officials an opportunity to mitigate the problem before an outbreak. With a $338,575 grant from the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, Alamdari and Sara Kamanmalek, a postdoctoral researcher at the college, are developing a tool that can predict harmful blue-green algae outbreaks. Its calculations will help the decision makers and water managers manage the problem more effectively. “We are using machine learning algorithms, water quality datasets, climatological data and remote sensing data to predict where algae is likely to be problematic,” Alamdari said. “We now have a cutting-edge online interactive tool that uses satellite data to predict these blooms.” The existing interactive tool developed by Alamdari’s team displays the cyanobacteria concentration across the lakes in Florida. The next phase of work will integrate data on harmful bacteria levels with variables like land use, nutrient loading, water temperature and streamflow. By examining this information, it can successfully predict algae concentration in lakes across Florida. “We created an integrated online map-viewer platform that shows the areas of interest,” Alamdari explained. “It provides valuable insights into potential algal blooms in Florida’s watersheds and enables managers and decision makers to implement effective management strategies for those regions.” WHY IT MATTERS Harmful blue-green algal blooms in freshwater lakes directly affect public health, ecosystem balance and local economies. The plants produce toxins that harm people, disrupt aquatic life, reduce tourism and impact fishing industries. Stopping its spread will save lives. As these blooms threaten drinking and agricultural water sources, the predictive tool provides a proactive approach for decision makers and communities to manage and prevent potential environmental challenges. The system ensures the safety and well-being of the local environment and communities. FUTURE WORK The project is in development and is expected to be completed in January. FDEP will evaluate the final tool for potential implementation. “We recently presented the tool to FDEP, and their response was overwhelmingly positive,” Alamdari said. “They were impressed by the tool’s capabilities and potential impact on freshwater lakes.” Posted in: Science & Technology | Tagged: Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering , Faculty , FAMU-FSU College of Engineering ,

                    By Jenn Jarecki , Nathaniel Wilson Published August 9, 2023 at 5:00 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 5:30 Vermont Department of Health / Courtesy In 2023, Burlington's beaches have already surpassed last year's total number of days closed. For Vermonters looking to escape the heat this summer, Burlington’s beaches have not provided much refuge. They and other Lake Champlain access sites have been periodically closed for swimming and other water activities since June. Many of these closures have been the result of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae blooms. To learn more, Vermont Public's Jenn Jarecki spoke to two city of Burlington employees: Erin Moreau, waterfront superintendent and harbormaster, and Megan Moir, division director of water resources. Their conversation below has been edited and condensed for clarity. Jenn Jarecki: Can you start by explaining to listeners what exactly cyanobacteria is? Megan Moir: It's an organism that has been around for years — many millions and millions of years. It's always there in the lake. Cyanobacteria can produce toxins, and that's why we're so involved in monitoring them and making sure that people have that information before they go to the beach. That's largely where Erin's work group is involved. I think one thing that's special in Burlington, but sometimes makes it look like we have poor water quality, is the fact that we have such a robust monitoring program. Megan Moir - Division Director of Water Resources, City of Burlington Erin Moreau: Yeah, we know this is an organism that lives in freshwater and feeds on phosphorus and nitrogen. And we know that it has to play with the lake temperature. And so that's something that we monitor daily. I wonder if one of you can contextualize for us how many algae blooms we're seeing so far this year. EM: So as we sit here, in the beginning of August, we have had 39 days of beach closures here in Burlington, and that's various beaches within our system being closed. Well, if we look at last year, the entirety of the season, we had 32 total. So as we stand now, we are trending above where we were last year. Megan, how can beachgoers be sure that swimming at these beaches is safe, even when they're open? Megan Moir / Courtesy Megan Moir MM: I think one thing that's special in Burlington, but sometimes makes it look like we have poor water quality, is the fact that we have such a robust monitoring program. The fact that Erin's staff are doing E. coli tests twice a week, I mean that those results are reported out and that they're also monitoring for cyanobacteria every single day, right? You could go to another place, and yes, there may be monitoring. But unless it's happening every single day during the swimming season, there could be blooms, there could be other conditions present that aren't necessarily getting documented and shared with the public. Erin, what does the city of Burlington do to identify cyanobacteria and decide whether or not a beach is safe for swimming? Carmen George / Courtesy Erin Moreau EM: So we have two different types of monitoring that we do. We do cyanobacteria monitoring and we also do E. coli monitoring in two very different ways. The first one, cyanobacteria, that is daily and multiple times daily. So, our staff, again, is trained to learn how to identify a possible cyanobacteria bloom. And that is a visual test that anyone can be trained on, by the way. And so we monitor, visually monitor all of our beaches. And so we are at those sites daily. And like I said, multiple times a day. For instance, North Beach, our lifeguards are trained. And so they are in the towers from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. And so we have very good eyes on these beaches, where you know, we will close if we see it, and we understand that we may close more than other community areas. The other type of testing we do is E. coli testing. And that is done by water sampling. And we do that twice a week. So, we go out via the harbormaster boat on Mondays and Thursdays, and we sample at each location. The larger beaches get two samples on either end just to make sure that we are capturing that. And we provide that to the DPW lab — our friends here. And they will return that result within the following morning. And so that's done twice a week, unless there's an anomaly and we'll test it again. Is it important that beachgoers also be able to spot it? And is there anything else they should be on the lookout for when heading to a beach or a water access area? EM: Yes, informed citizens are powerful citizens, and educated citizens to make a good decision based on their well-being. The more you understand, the more you understand our recreational waters. You know, along with cyanobacteria blooms, anytime we get a large rain event that is pushing waters from our rivers into our lake, I always say 'Hey, there could be debris there, there could be logs in the water.' And so if you're recreational boating, because I do want to mention that as well, that there could be more debris in the water when we have had a flood event or high rain or snow melt off. MM: I'm just gonna say that it's, you know, it is a very complex process. We don't know the exact formula for when blooms occur. And I know that can be disappointing to people for us not to be able to predict. But I think the thing to know, what we try to convey, is like, we are doing our part both in managing the immediate issue of collecting information and making sure swimmers have information at their fingertips to make choices. And then it's a little bit more behind the scenes but my staff really is trying to put the pieces in place to make sure that we're turning off the faucet of phosphorus from Burlington.

					59 Should you be worried about algal bloom toxins in the Virgin River? Written by Mori Kessler June 6, 2023 ST. GEORGE — Three years after their discovery, algal bloom toxins in the Virgin River are reported to be at their lowest levels thanks to the high river flows from snowpack runoff. In this file photo, a view of the Watchman and the Virgin River in Zion National Park, unspecified date | Photo provided by Pixbay, St. George News “The tremendous winter has brought in scouring high runoff, reducing benthic cyanobacteria loads in the major Virgin River tributaries of Zion National Park,” the town of Springdale reported in a recent email. “As a result, the park has downgraded the recreational health advisory to Health Watch for all waterbodies in the park.” The change was recorded and reported by the National Park Service, which has taken on the responsibility of monitoring toxin levels in the Virgin River. The park service provides monthly updates with the most recent being May 25. These updates can be found on the Zion National Park and Utah Division of Water Quality websites. “While I still wouldn’t take a swig out of the Virgin River, these are the best advisory levels that we have seen since we started monitoring three years ago,” Hannah Bonner, the Utah Division of Water Quality’s recreational water quality program coordinator, told St. George News. In the last three years, the presence of harmful algal blooms has been found in the North Fork of the Virgin River, North Creek and LaVerkin Creek. What is cyanobacteria and how is it harmful? Signs of algal blooms and cyanobacteria, the toxins that the blooms create, were originally found in the North Fork of the Virgin River in Zion National Park in July 2020 . At the time it was reported that a family pet, a Siberian Husky pup, had been playing in the water and “snapping” at algae growing on a rock. Soon after, the pup became unable able to walk, experienced seizures and died. Toxins from an algal bloom were confirmed as the cause of death. In this file photo, a scientist samples cyanobacteria in the Virgin River, Zion National Park, July 2020 | Photo courtesy of the National Park Service, St. George News Cyanobacteria, also known as “blue-green algae,” is naturally occurring in waterbodies and can be found floating on top of water or throughout the water column, according to the park service . In the case of the Virgin River, the algae usually forms on the bottom of the river and is known as “benthic cyanobacteria.” This can grow on rocks, plants, at the sides of the rivers or along the river’s edge. The algae is also photosynthetic, meaning it will grow in water wherever sunlight reaches. When first detected in the Virgin River in 2020, Bonner said it was the first case of river-based cyanobacteria in Utah and the second-known case in the United States. Since then, however, many more cases of river-based algal blooms have been discovered around the country. When the algae blooms, it produces large amounts of cyanotoxins that are harmful to humans and animals, particularly dogs. Symptoms of possible exposure to cyanotoxins can include but are not limited to skin rash, salivation, drowsiness, tingling, burning, numbness, pain, incoherent speech, seizures, vomiting and diarrhea. Drinking toxin-contaminated water may also result in liver and kidney damage. Attempting to filter or boil water does not remove the cyanotoxins. It is recommended that if you must filter water, get it directly from the spring source. Contact the Utah Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 with concerns about cyanotoxin poisoning and call 911 in the event of a medical emergency. A health watch versus a health warning and a danger warning The advisory chart used by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality in relation to algal bloom. It has recently been adopted by Zion National Park related to the blooms in the Virgin River | Image courtesy of Zion National Park, St. George News | Click to enlarge The three levels of warning for harmful algal blooms observed by Zion National Park are set by the Utah Department of Environmental Quality. A health watch is the lowest advisory level and is considered an informal warning that elements of harmful algal bloom are likely present. Recreators are asked to exercise caution when interacting with a possibly contaminated water source. A health warning happens when the recorded levels of algal bloom toxins exceed thresholds where harm is known to occur that can result in either short- or long-term illness. At this point, warning signs are posted at primary recreation sites and weekly sampling of the contaminated waterbodies is recommended. A danger advisory results in the closure of the contaminated area as toxins levels can lead to acute poisoning at that point. Danger signs are posted and samplings of the water are recommended to be taken at least once a week. Last November, parts of the Virgin River were under warning and danger advisories due to recorded toxin levels. “They’ve removed all formal advisories from the tributaries, which is really exciting and good news,” Bonner said, yet added, “People should still exercise caution.” Blooms expected to return this summer In this file photo, the Virgin River running high by the Sullivan Soccer Park in Washington City, Utah, April 13, 2023 | Photo by Mori Kessler, St. George News While high flows triggered by snow runoff are credited with clearing out the algal blooms, Bonner said it isn’t likely a permanent solution to the problem. “It probably isn’t a fix forever, but at least it is for now with the high flows,” she said. “We don’t expect them (the algae) to be growing abundantly in any of these waterbodies for now. … Our expectation is that once the flow dies down and the Virgin River returns to normal, we’ll start seeing the algae growing again and it’s very likely the advisories will come back into play this summer.” Resources People can learn more about harmful algal blooms and cyanobacteria at: Utah Division of Water Quality Zion National Park algal bloom page Environmental Protection Agency As a part of its efforts to educate the public about harmful algal blooms on the Virgin River, Zion National Park has produced a series of videos giving a summary of what harmful algal blooms are, what the bacteria from them can do, and how to identify signs of cyanobacteria. “People taking time to learn what the algae looks like and what to look for can be really helpful and help them make wise recreational decisions,” Bonner said.

													the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked trusted source proofread Chinese scientists unravel cGNAT2 role in cyanobacteria by Liu Jia, Chinese Academy of Sciences An image of Cyanobacteria, Tolypothrix. Credit: Wikipedia / CC BY-SA 3.0 Cyanobacteria are a diverse group of gram-negative bacteria that conduct plant-like oxygenic photosynthesis and are thought to be the evolutionary ancestors of chloroplasts in higher plants. Lysine acetylation is an important regulatory posttranslational modification that controls photosynthesis and metabolic processes in cyanobacteria and plants. Synechococcus PCC 7002 is a unicellular cyanobacterium that has been used as a model organism to study photosynthesis. A total of 802 acetylated proteins in Synechococcus PCC 7002 have been identified; however, the enzymes that govern reversible lysine acetylation in cyanobacteria remain largely unknown. A research team led by Prof. Ge Feng from the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has illustrated the structure, function, and mechanism of lysine acetyltransferase in cyanobacteria, and identified acetylation in regulating the growth and photosynthesis of Synechococcus PCC 7002. The study was published in Plant Physiology . In this study, the researchers identified 16 predicted lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) in the Synechococcus PCC 7002 genome using bioinformatic analyses, and tested these KATs using an acetylation-deficient E. coli strain devoid of all known acetylation mechanisms. They discovered the presence of the lysine acetyltransferase cyanobacterial Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (cGNAT2) in cyanobacteria, and that the knockout of this gene significantly affected the photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. Then, the researchers utilized AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of cGNAT2 and discovered that it forms a homodimeric structure. This protein has the capability to bind both substrate proteins and acetyl-CoA, enabling it to exert catalytic activity . Through molecular docking, the binding region between cGNAT2 and acetyl-CoA was identified. Further confirmation was obtained through site-specific mutations and in vitro enzyme activity experiments, which demonstrated the critical role of eight specific amino acid residues in maintaining the enzyme's activity. Based on acetyllysine enrichment and label-free quantitative (LFQ) acetylome techniques, the researchers demonstrated that cGNAT2 can catalyze lysine acetylation in NAD(P)H dehydrogenase J (NdhJ) to regulate its enzymatic activity in vivo and in vitro, which may underlie changes in cell growth and photosynthetic electron transport. This study presents the first report of the lysine acetyltransferase cGNAT2 in cyanobacteria, elucidating its molecular mechanism in regulating substrate protein acetylation modifications in cyanobacteria. It will improve the understanding of the mechanisms underlying extensive lysine acetylation in cyanobacteria, as well as the mechanisms that regulate photosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms.

Prev Next If you're planning to head out to Lake Isabella this summer, there is something the Kern County Department of Public Health wants you to know about when it comes to recreational activities and natural water: cyanobacteria. 23ABC's Breanna Polk has more. By: Breanna Polk, 23ABC Posted at 10:52 PM, Jun 23, 2023 and last updated 2023-06-24 02:20:20-04 LAKE ISABELLA, Calif. (KERO) — If you're planning to head out to Lake Isabella this summer, there is something the Kern County Department of Public Health wants you to know about when it comes to recreational activities and natural water: cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, is capable of producing toxins that can make people and animals very sick, and it's something Michelle Corson with KCDPH is warning summer swimmers to be on the lookout for. ""What this really is, it's naturally occurring algal blooms that happen in bodies of water, and certain things like how warm it is, how much the water is moving, how many nutrients are feeding these blooms, these play a role in producing these potentially harmful toxins,"" said Corson. According to Corson, KCDPH goes out to the lake every month to conduct tests for blue-green algae. Most recently, the department tested 16 different areas of Lake Isabella and found that the Hanning Flat and Tillie Creek boat launch areas tested positive for the presence of cyanobacteria at a cautionary level. 'Cautionary' is the lowest of 3 cyanobacteria advisory levels. However, Corson says just because it's at the lowest level doesn't mean it isn't still potentially harmful. ""If you were to come in contact, you have anything from a more dermal exposure, which means you're maybe going to have a rash and some burning, or if you were to ingest this, you could become sick and nauseous, vomiting,"" said Corson. ""Anything like that you are concerned about you're going to want to seek medical attention."" Corson says not only should you be looking out for yourself, but it's also important to keep a close eye on your dog if you bring them while visiting the lake. They too can be impacted by cyanobacterial toxins. ""Our dogs are going to be more likely to go out in that water. They can potentially ingest that water, or when they get out of the water they often will lick their paws and their fur and then ingest it that way,"" said Corson. ""That's when it becomes more dangerous and of concern."" And if you plan on fishing at Lake Isabella, Corson recommends that you throw away the guts and clean the meat after filleting it with tap or bottled water before you cook and eat it. ""We're at just the cautionary yellow level at the moment. If we get to the higher levels, we say to avoid fishing altogether. This is, again, something that we want our community to watch that signage, read what those warning signs say and the steps that you should take,"" said Corson. For more information about where exactly the blue-green algae cautionary areas and advisory levels in Lake Isabella are, Kern Public Health maintains an interactive map of the areas they've tested and their results on their website.

While there have been no human deaths, animals have died from the toxic effects, the report shows. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) seem to be becoming worse nationwide, especially during the summer. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new report that analyzes data from 2021, 16 states reported a total of 117 human illnesses and at least 2,715 animal illnesses as a result of HAB events. HAB events peak in August, the report found, with 90% of blooms occurring in lakes, reservoirs and other fresh waters. HABs emerge from the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria — also known as blue-green algae, according to the CDC. ""HAB events of public health concern are primarily caused by microalgae (e.g., diatoms and dinoflagellates), cyanobacteria, and the toxins they can produce,"" the CDC said in its report. ""HAB events, which can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature, can have public health, environmental, and economic impacts."" The CDC's report is based on voluntary reporting by public health agencies and their designated environmental health or animal health partners. In 2021, the CDC said 368 HAB events were reported by 16 state jurisdictions, which is a significant increase compared to previous years where less than 250 HAB events were reported in 2020 and 2019. Exposure to high levels of blue-green algae and their toxins can cause illness and death, the CDC said. Several states have reported wildlife, domestic pet and livestock illnesses and deaths in recent years. What did CDC find? Human illnesses from toxic blue-green algae happened predominately in June, the CDC said. The most commonly reported symptoms were gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and generalized, such as headaches and fevers. Of the 117 cases, the CDC said 46% of illnesses were among people younger than 18 years old, suggesting children and teens may be at higher risk of illness than adults. No deaths were reported. Nearly all of the cases of human illness reported water as a source of exposure to HABs, according to the CDC. People were exposed to HABs predominately at public outdoor areas and beaches. Animal illnesses occurred primarily in August and mostly involved wildlife, according to the CDC. Among the cases, the animals most affected were dogs, cattle and bats. At least 2,715 animal cases of illness were reported in 2021 with 76% of wildlife cases classified as confirmed, 67% of domestic cases as probable and 60% of livestock cases as suspect, the CDC said. And 92% of the animals reported ill died. Rotting seaweed, dead fish, no sand: Climate change threatens to ruin US beaches What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. How is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals. Public health officials have said exposure to high levels of blue-green algae and their toxins can cause illnesses, including diarrhea, nausea or vomiting; skin, eye or throat irritation; and allergic reactions or breathing difficulties. Pets and livestock can also get sick or die if they consume large amounts of water containing blooms, scums or benthic mats. Southern California algae bloom: Toxic algae bloom suspected in deaths of sea lions and dolphins on Southern California coast Reported cases nationwide Blue-green algae blooms have been observed across the United States. Some cases have triggered health officials to warn visitors and residents to not swim, wade, boat, eat fish, or let pets sip water from different bodies of water. In its report, the CDC said a large wildlife mortality event occurred in Washington from a single harmful algae bloom and involved at least 2,000 bats. This was the largest bat die-off linked to a harmful algae bloom ever reported to the CDC. Last week, Kansas health officials reported that nine state lakes were impacted by blue-green algae and issued several types of advisories for those areas. The toxic algae has also plagued Florida waterways for years, thriving on excess nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers, septic tanks and sewage spills. Several Florida dogs have gotten sick or died from drinking water laden with toxic blue-green algae in recent years. In 2021, Bella, an 8-year-old boxer died after she ate toxin-laced detritus from a canal, marking her as possibly the first reported canine death in Palm Beach County from blue-green algae poisoning. In 2018, six dogs got sick from blue-green algae in the St. Lucie River, one fatally.

While predictions focused on the importance of climate variables for possible invasion, other barriers to dispersal and successful colonization need to be overcome by the species for successful invasion. In this study, we combine field-based surveys of R. raciborskii (microscopy and molecular analysis using species-specific primers) of 11 Swedish lakes and in-silico screening of environmental DNA using 153 metagenomic datasets from lakes across Europe to validate the SDMs prediction. Field-based studies in lakes with high/low predicted probability of occurrence did not detect the presence of R. raciborskii , and in-silico screening only detected hints of its presence in 5 metagenomes from lakes with probability ranging from 0.059 to 0.825. The inconsistencies between SDMs results and both field-based/in-silico monitoring could be due to either sensitivity of monitoring approaches in detecting early invasions or uncertainties in SDMs that focused solely on climate drivers. However, results highlight the necessity of proactive monitoring with high temporal and spatial frequency. Invasion of microorganisms to a new ecosystem usually becomes noticeable only after crucial ecosystem services have been jeopardized [ 1 ]. However, the invasion of species capable of toxin production to new areas demands vigilant and proactive surveillance. The invasive Raphidiopsis raciborskii is an example of a toxin-producing, nitrogen-fixing, and bloom-forming filamentous cyanobacterium [ 2 ]. Strains of R. raciborskii differ in their ability to produce (cyano)toxins (cylindrospermopsin and saxitoxin), known to affect cattle, wild animals and humans, as well as many ecosystem services such as drinking and recreational water resources [ 3 , 4 , 5 ]. R. raciborskii , a species of tropical origin, is currently expanding its range across Europe’s freshwater ecosystems [ 6 , 7 , 8 ]. As early detection of an invasive species is requisite for implementation of efficient management actions, identifying areas at risk of invasion is therefore of high priority [ 2 ]. For this purpose, predictive models are useful for assessing the suitable habitats for colonization. Species distribution models (SDMs) predictions based on bioclimatic factors can be used to complement patchy species distributions derived from sporadic samplings and occasional reports of presence/absence of a target species [ 9 ]. However, SDMs results should mainly be considered as early warnings, underpinning monitoring efforts rather than proof of presence/invasion [ 10 ]. SDMs are statistical procedures that link occurrence records of a species to environmental variables to estimate spatial distribution patterns using a correlative approach [ 11 , 12 ], however, successful colonization also requires the dispersal and establishment of invasive species in the new ecosystem [ 13 , 14 ]. That is why most such modeling efforts face the same argument of whether their predictions have been empirically supported bringing another challenge regarding the reliability in the early detection of invasive species in areas at high risk of being invaded. In a previous study [ 15 ], we based the SDMs on published observations of R. raciborskii and environmental predictors obtained from climatic models to visualize and predict potential new habitats for R. raciborskii in Europe. While this species has not been reported in Sweden, our SDMs prediction revealed potential areas for range expansion in the southern and central regions of Sweden [ 15 ]. Here, we integrate field-based surveys in Sweden and in-silico screening of environmental DNA from lakes across Europe to validate the SDMs prediction and highlight challenges in supplying such empirical proofs. To provide empirical proof for the potential expansion of R. raciborskii to Sweden, we selected a number of eutrophic shallow lakes, sampled in late summer, with high (>0.5) and low (<0.5) predicted probability of presence (Table 1 ) and performed microscopic and molecular surveys (Supplementary Information S.1 ., for detailed sampling methodology). Water and sediment samples were used for DNA extraction and the rpoC1 gene [ 16 ] was targeted and amplified with R. raciborskii specific primers cyl2/cyl4 [ 16 ] and cyl4F/cyl4R [ 17 ] (Supplementary Information S.1.3 ). The specific primers were tested on a European strain of R. raciborskii (NIVA-CYA 399, Norwegian Culture Collection of Algae) isolated from Lake Balaton (Hungary), this strain was also used as a positive control. The products of the species-specific polymerase chain reactions were separated by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized under UV illumination. None of these 11 lakes resulted in the amplification of the target region suggesting the absence of R. raciborskii . However, since molecular methods could suffer from a limited detection range, the sensitivity and the detection limits of the method were evaluated. Accordingly, a total of 50, 100, and 500 filaments of the reference culture of R. raciborskii (NIVA-CYA 399) were picked using an inverted light microscope, and the same procedure used for field samples was followed. While the cyl4F/cyl4R returned a band for all three reactions, the cyl2/cyl4 primer was only able to return a band for the reactions with 100 and 500 filaments (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). This highlights the partial limitation of this molecular method in detecting the presence of this invasive species, especially during early stages of invasion when population densities are likely low. Using other molecular methods such as duplex digital PCR (dPCR) is reported to improve the detection limit [ 18 ]; however, requirements of such methods might not be as widely accessible as PCR. The negative results of molecular analyses were corroborated by the lack of microscopic identification of R. raciborskii in the samples (Supplementary Information, S.1.2 ). To complement the field study, in-silico screening of environmental DNA using publicly available lake metagenomes was also performed. A total of 153 metagenomic datasets from 50 lakes across Europe were selected from publicly available datasets stored in the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) (Table 1 ). The 16 S rRNA reads were extracted from these metagenomes using SSU-align tool [ 19 ] and their taxonomy was assigned using BLAST [ 20 ] against Silva SSU 138.1 [ 21 ] (Supplementary Information, S.1.4 ). The probability of occurrence of each site based on the SDMs prediction covered probabilities from 0.055 to 0.846 (Table 1 ) with a median of 0.276 indicating that metagenome availability and selection was slightly biased towards sites which may not favor R. raciborskii settlement/survival. Only 5 out of 153 screened metagenomes contained reads matching the R. raciborskii 16 S rRNA sequence (Table 1 and Fig. 1 ). The lakes from which these 5 metagenomes originate are situated in areas with high probability of occurrence in three cases (0.537 to 0.825) and lower probability (0.059 and 0.319) in two cases. The low number of reads matching the R. raciborskii 16 S rRNA sequence makes it difficult to define a threshold in interpreting the SDMs prediction. In addition, lower abundances in the early stages of invasion poses limitations for in-silico methods in general and specifically for R. raciborskii since cyanobacteria are usually underrepresented in metagenomic datasets. Additionally, timing and frequency of sampling will also affect the efficiency of early detection methods as seen in the case of Rimov reservoir (predicted probability of 0.319), where only one of 38 metagenomes had a positive match (Table 1 ).

Full size image While SDMs are valuable tools for predicting potential invasion sites and to guide management efforts, many uncertainties remain. One of the most important limitations when constructing the SDMs was the general lack of relevant environmental variables for predicting the range expansion of the invasive species. Reports of presence are not usually accompanied by detailed environmental metadata, such as temperature and nutrients, that are known to be important for phytoplankton [ 9 ], and knowledge of interactions with native species in invaded areas is largely lacking. This suggests that frequent monitoring and open access to additional biotic and abiotic data connected to the presence of the target species in already invaded areas are necessary for developing high grid resolution and more accurate models to predict the likelihood of invasion into new aquatic environments.
