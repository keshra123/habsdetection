There are many kinds of HABs, caused by a variety of algal groups with different toxins. The HABs in fresh and marine waters are usually very different, but they overlap in low salinity estuaries (places where rivers meet the sea). The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal. States have rigorous monitoring programs to ensure that commercially harvested fish and shellfish are safe to eat. HABs have been reported in every U.S. coastal state, and their occurrence may be on the rise. HABs are a national concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems, but also the ""health"" of local and regional economies.

Ocean Fact What is red tide? Video All about HABs Explainer HAB Research Stressors & Mitigation Frequently Asked Questions What is a harmful algal bloom? Algae are a beneficial part of natural environments and only a few are harmful.Â Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Some HABs produce toxins that have harmful effects on people, fish, marine mammals, and birds. The toxins produced by algae vary by species and region, and impact organisms in different ways. HAB species and their impacts vary significantly from region to region.Â Information on the health effects of HABs on marine animals, shellfish, and people is available from NOAA , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . What is the difference between a marine and freshwater HAB? Algae are the bottom of the food chain in all natural environments. Only a few are harmful.Â HABs can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Cyanobacteria , a type of photosynthetic bacteria also known as blue-green algae, are often the cause of algal blooms in freshwater and occasionally in marine water. As the name implies, they often (but not always) discolor the water bright green or blue green and form scum. A combination of environmental factors such as the presence of nutrients, warm temperatures, and lots of light encourage the natural increase in the numbers of cyanobacteria.Â Cyanobacteria HABs produce multiple toxins , including liver, nerve, and skin toxins, which can affect human and animal health. The most common cyanobacterial HAB toxins in the U.S. are microcystins, a group of liver toxins that can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, and mortality in pets, livestock, and wildlife. Alternatively, dinoflagellates and diatoms , different types of phytoplankton, are the most common HAB species in marine and brackish waters, including estuaries. Some of these blooms discolor the water different shades of red and brown and a few are bioluminescent.Â While the causes of individual marine HAB events have been shown to vary across years and locations, nutrient inputs may help sustain an event once the bloom reaches the shoreline. Some dinoflagellate species produce cysts, which are dormant “seeds” that are created during a bloom and are capable of living through harsh conditions. When favorable conditions resume, the cysts rupture, germinate, and populate the water column with a new generation of photosynthetically active cells primed for another bloom. Marine HABs produce toxins that may result in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, , diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera poisoning in fish, respiratory irritation in humans, or shellfish contamination. Some marine HABs also affect the central nervous system of fish, marine mammals, and birds. In both marine and freshwater environments, there are also HABs that do not directly affect humans but can kill fish, shellfish, and invertebrates or cause other ecosystem impacts such as shading submerged aquatic vegetation, smothering corals, or causing oxygen in the water to be depleted .Â For example, fish kills in freshwater may be caused by golden algae and brown tides , which result in many ecosystem impacts in estuaries. Is the HAB in my state the same as in Florida? The varieties of HABs, the toxins they produce, and the impacts they cause vary significantly from region to region. HABs are a multi-faceted threat with different environmental factors leading to the prevalence of different algal species, as well as the presence or absence of toxins. These factors include physical and biological conditions that influence HAB growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Learn more about specific HABs and available resources where you live from our regional HAB pages. How does NOAA forecast harmful algal blooms? NOAA's Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring System provides products for the Gulf of Maine , Lake Erie , and in Florida , Louisiana , and North Carolina . These monitoring products identify the location and extent of the bloom and rely on satellite imagery, field observations, models, public health reports, and buoy data to provide information on bloom events. Additionally, NOAA’s Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System bulletins and condition reports are available for the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Erie . The HAB forecasts and bulletins alert coastal managers to blooms before they result in serious damage and identify the risk of respiratory irritation in a county over the coming days. Short-term (once or twice weekly) forecasts identify which blooms are potentially harmful, where they are, how big they are, and where they're likely headed. Longer-term, seasonal forecasts predict the severity of HABs for the bloom season in a particular region. The bulletins provide decision-makers with a more in-depth analysis of the current bloom location and reported impacts, as well as forecasts of potential development, intensification, transport, and associated impacts of blooms. NOAA is funding researchers and local agencies in other regions of the U.S. to develop new forecasting and monitoring systems, including the Gulf of Maine , the central and southern California coast , and the Pacific Northwest . What areas are prone to harmful algal blooms? HABs occur in all U.S. waters . According to the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, NOAA has purview over HABs in marine environments, whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is focused on freshwater HABs that occur in all U.S. states. NOAA and EPA share authority over the Great Lakes with regards to HABs. Visit the NOAA Ecological Forecasting page to see ecological forecasting ""hotspots"" in marine/coastal environments or the Great Lakes, or select a region at the top of this page to learn more about region-specific resources. How long does a HAB event last? The duration of a HAB event depends on a number of factors and is not possible to predict in advance. For example, red tides in Florida can last as little as a few weeks to longer than a year. They may even subside and then reoccur. The duration of a bloom depends on physical and biological conditions that influence its growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Can a HAB be stopped? HABs can’t be stopped but control methods are currently being investigated. In the early 2000s, NOAA funded studies to test the use of clays to control red tides. Since that time, different types of clays have been developed that have fewer environmental effects and are in the initial phases of testing. This method involves a modified clay mineral that, when dispersed into the ocean surface, binds with red tide cells and the toxins they produce and carries them to the seafloor where they are eventually buried. Additionally, many other control methods are being tested. For example, engineers at Nano Air Bubble Aeration System Technology are researching an environmentally sustainable method to eliminate harmful freshwater algae and their toxins. The method uses nanobubbles â bubbles smaller than the width of a single human hair â to aerate water bodies and create ozone that helps dissolve harmful algae. Another instance is the examination of a chemical control agent isolated from a bacteria species that may provide a mechanism for halting the growth of certain types of toxic dinoflagellate harmful algal blooms while having no negative impacts on other organisms . How do you find out if it is safe to go to the beach or harvest shellfish during a HAB? Some beach areas may be more affected than others during a HAB event. Check local health departments and local governmental websites for the latest information about HAB events and safety. If you have a chronic respiratory condition, avoid beaches during HAB events. What do you do if you see injured, sick, stranded, or dead wildlife? Do not touch or try to rescue any animal that appears to be impacted by HABs. Reporting sick, injured, entangled, stranded, or dead animal is the best way to make sure professional responders and scientists know about it and can take appropriate action. Numerous organizations around the country are trained and ready to respond. If you see a sick, injured, stranded, or dead marine mammal or sea turtle, immediately contact your local stranding network. Visit the NOAA Fisheries website and follow the instructions. You can also use Fisheries’ Dolphin and Whale 911 app for Apple devices to report a stranded marine mammal. How can harmful algal blooms affect pets? Because of their behavior, dogs are much more susceptible than humans to cyanobacterial poisoning, which is typically found in freshwater bodies and some estuaries. When toxins are present, dogs can be exposed to toxins by drinking the water, by eating washed up mats or scum of toxic cyanobacteria, and by having skin contact with water. Dogs are often attracted to algal scum odors. After leaving the water, dogs can also be poisoned by grooming their fur and paws. If your dog has been swimming in a lake or pond with a suspected or identified HAB, closely monitor your dog for any signs of cyanobacterial poisoning and be sure to rinse the dog with clean water. Signs of poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to a few hours after exposure, depending on the size of the dog, the type of toxin, the toxin concentration, and how much toxin the dog has ingested. In severe cases, dogs can show signs of cyanobacterial poisoning within a few minutes and can die within an hour of toxin exposure. NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science provides additional information and resources for protecting your dog from HABs . Although there is not a large body of data, there are reports of other HABs affecting dogs. As a precaution, do not allow dogs to swim in discolored water, roll in or eat algae piled on the beach, or run and play on beaches where humans are experiencing respiratory problems.

These effects, along with nutrient pollution, might cause algal blooms to become more severe and to occur more often in more waterbodies. Blooms with the potential to harm human health, pets, livestock, or aquatic ecosystems are referred to as harmful algal blooms, or HABs, and they can also have wide ranging economic impacts. In freshwaters, cyanobacteria (microscopic photosynthetic bacteria previously known as blue-green algae due to their color) are the most common HAB producers. Some cyanobacterial HABs, or cyanoHABs, produce toxins that cause illness in humans and other animals. Climate Factors That Affect HABs: Warming water temperature Toxic cyanobacterial bloom HAB forming cyanobacteria thrive in warm, slow-moving water, and typically occur when water temperatures are warmer. As a result, increases in water temperature with climate change are expected to increase the magnitude and duration of cyanoHABs. Warmer water temperatures favor cyanoHABs in several ways, including: CyanoHAB species grow faster than other algae at warmer temperatures CyanoHABs migrate up and down the water column better than other algae. They get nutrients from the cooler, dark, bottom layers and use them to grow in the warmer, upper layers where there is more light. Other algae cannot do this and are shaded by the CyanoHAB species. CyanoHABs absorb sunlight and release heat, making surface waters even warmer, further increasing their advantages. Changes in salinity In some regions, climate change is predicted to reduce freshwater runoff due to drought and increased evaporation. These effects will combine to increase salinity in inland waters. This can impact irrigation, harm crops, contaminate drinking water, and allow the invasion of salt-tolerant and marine algae to inland lakes. In the southwestern and south-central United States, more salt-tolerant algal HABs known as “golden algae” have regularly recurred, expanded into lagoons, and killed fish in freshwater lakes since 2000. In other regions, increased runoff from more intense rainfalls may increase freshwater flows to coastal areas. This freshwater sits on top of saltwater because it is lighter. This can prevent mixing of oxygen rich surface water with deeper layers where the oxygen has been removed by the decomposition of HABs after they die and sink to the bottom layer. These low oxygen (or hypoxic) zones harm or kill animals that require oxygen to live, including many commercially important species. Higher carbon dioxide levels Algae need carbon dioxide to survive. Higher levels of carbon dioxide in the air and water can lead to rapid growth of algae, especially cyanoHABs that can float to the surface of the water and use the increased carbon dioxide. Increased levels of carbon dioxide also increase the acidity of the water, which affects competition among algal species and impacts the organisms that graze on algae. These effects can combine to increase the competitive advantage of HAB species. Changes in rainfall and resulting increases in nutrient loadings A satellite image of a cyanoHAB -taken on October 8, 2022-  in the western basin of Lake Erie. (Image credit: European Space Agency) Climate change is affecting rainfall patterns, increasing both rainfall intensity and the duration of drought. Increased rainfall causes higher nutrient runoff from land into waterbodies fueling HABs like those observed in Lake Erie in 2011 and 2015. If followed by extended drought, waterbodies can retain those nutrients for longer, favoring HAB species that compete better under higher nutrient conditions. Moreover, increases in extreme rainfall and subsequent increases in freshwater flows may flush large loads of nutrients, freshwater HABs and their associated toxins into estuaries and marine areas. As a result, estuarine and marine waters may be at greater risk of developing HABs or seeing an exacerbation of existing HABs. Sea level rise Scientists predict that sea level could rise one meter by the year 2100. This would increase the area of shallow, stable coastal waters that provide more favorable conditions for HABs. Coastal upwelling Coastal upwelling occurs when wind pushes warm, surface water offshore and deep, nutrient rich waters rise to replace it. Climate change is expected to alter the timing and intensity of coastal upwelling. Along the west coast of the United States, excess nutrients delivered by upwelling might lead to more algal blooms, including HABs, especially when combined with increased runoff of nutrient pollution from the land.

NASA Scientists Test New Tool for Tracking Algal Blooms Sept. 6, 2023 NASA’s MODIS instrument captured this image of the southern tip of Florida curving into a blue-green ocean edged by white clouds. MODIS and a new generation of satellite-based sensors can help environmental managers track noxious algae in the Gulf Coast and beyond. Credit: NASA Harmful algae can endanger public health and coastal ecosystems and economies. Advances in satellite imaging are providing new ways to look at our living ocean. By the time they were over, a series of massive algal blooms along the west coast of Florida in 2020 would be linked to some 2,000 tons of dead marine life around Tampa Bay. The human costs were stark, too, including a double-digit increase in asthma cases in Sarasota and Pinellas counties, and estimated losses of around $1 billion across economic sectors from tourism to fisheries. Earth-orbiting satellites have been used for decades to detect algal blooms from space, enabling more frequent observations over broader areas than is possible by directly sampling the water. The most common observing technique relies on the visible spectrum to measure ocean color. However, this approach has been mostly restricted to clear sky conditions. A recent study , led by scientists at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California, has shown how one space-based instrument called TROPOMI, or TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument , was able to peer through thin clouds to uncover powerful clues about Karenia brevis (or K. brevis), the microscopic algae responsible for the 2020 blooms. TROPOMI’s enhanced ability to “see” and measure fine wavelengths of light could potentially help federal agencies and local communities better forecast and manage harmful outbreaks. (TROPOMI flies aboard the European Sentinel 5P spacecraft, which was launched in 2017.) The scientists examined the West Florida Shelf, a stretch of continental crust arcing from the Panhandle to the Keys. From its origins in other parts of the Gulf of Mexico, K. brevis is carried toward the coastline on strong winds and ocean currents. Recent research has shown that western Florida, like many coastal communities, may be increasingly vulnerable to outbreaks because these algae flourish in nutrient-rich, warm conditions fueled by runoff, fertilizer, and climate change. Get the Latest JPL News SUBSCRIBE TO THE NEWSLETTER Systems for monitoring and forecasting harmful algal blooms are available in many states and coastal regions, including the Gulf of Mexico and Great Lakes. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) works with academic, state, tribal, and local partners to develop and issue harmful algal bloom forecasts – similar to weather forecasts – during the seasons when blooms occur. K. brevis events are especially concerning because the algae produce a potent neurotoxin that in high concentrations can cause massive fish kills and poison marine life such as turtles, manatees, and birds. The toxin can also be inhaled, causing respiratory illness in humans, and it can accumulate in shellfish, resulting in gastrointestinal illness in people who consume them. As the algae feed and grow via photosynthesis, K. brevis emits a faint red glow called solar-induced fluorescence (red SIF) that can be detected by some satellite instruments including TROPOMI, which was actually designed to measure air pollution. Sifting through TROPOMI data acquired along the coast of western Florida between 2018 and 2020, the team found that the instrument gathered about twice as much fluorescence information emitted by the algae as observed by previous methods that rely on ocean color. TROPOMI’s advanced imaging capabilities – including four spectrometers measuring light ranging from the ultraviolet to shortwave infrared – enable it to penetrate thin cloud cover and obtain measurements of the ocean surface more frequently. Space-Based Advantage The scientists said their findings demonstrate the value of using TROPOMI by itself or in concert with other Earth-observing tools such as NASA’s longtime MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument, aboard the Aqua and Terra satellites. MODIS measures ocean color and is currently being used by environmental managers in Florida and other places to detect algae on clear days. Another ocean color instrument – scheduled to launch early in 2024 – will look at the world’s marine ecosystems like never before. NASA’s PACE, or Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission , will study phytoplankton and other ocean biology, atmospheric aerosols, and clouds in many more wavelengths than previous sensors. These observations will help forecast the appearance of harmful algae, as well as the boom-bust cycle of fisheries and other factors that affect commercial and recreational industries. “For nearly 20 years, ocean color sensors have been foundational for satellite monitoring of harmful algal blooms,” said lead author Kelly Luis, a NASA postdoctoral program fellow at JPL. “This application of TROPOMI red SIF demonstrates how the combination of satellite technologies can bolster early warning systems beyond clear sky conditions.” Early warning via satellite has been shown to have real-world benefits. A recent NASA-funded case study found that early detection of cyanobacteria in Utah Lake led to significant savings on health care, lost work hours, and other economic losses. A few days of advance warning can translate to faster action on the ground, including public alerts and even beach closures. News Media Contact Jane J.

By gisele galoustian | 2/8/2024 Florida Atlantic University researchers are asking residents of Stuart and surrounding communities to “follow their hearts” on Valentine’s Day and participate in a study to help evaluate the potential impacts of exposure to harmful algal blooms. FAU researchers will recruit these additional study participants and collect non-bloom data on Feb. 14 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Volunteers in Medicine, 417 SE Balboa Ave., in Stuart. Appointments are available and walk-ins are welcome. During harmful algal blooms, species of cyanobacteria release a variety of toxic compounds including microcystins, a potent toxin, into local waterways. Human exposure comes from ingestion, direct skin contact or inhalation, and can lead to a variety of symptoms ranging from gastroenteritis, nausea, allergic reactions and skin rashes to liver damage in severe cases. Despite numerous occurrences of red tide and blue green algae in Florida waters, our understanding of the long-term health effects of exposure to these blooms remains limited. With grant funding from the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), researchers from FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute are continuing the first-of-its-kind evaluation of both the short-term and potential long-term health effects among Florida residents. The “Long-term Effects of Exposure to Harmful Algal Blooms” (LEE-HABs) study uses a collaborative, multisite approach, which also includes researchers from Florida Gulf Coast University. This latest study expands upon prior studies conducted in 2016 and 2018, and previous FDOH studies from 2019 to 2020 and 2021 to 2022. “We have minimal data on health outcomes related to human exposure, despite the prevalence and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms in South Florida,” said Rebecca S. Koszalinski , Ph.D., principal investigator and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “Understanding short- and long-term health impacts and outcomes is crucial to protecting the health of Floridians. By developing tools to measure concentrations of harmful algal blooms toxins in the environment and multiple human tissues, we will gain a better understanding of health-related outcomes and health care needs in Florida and elsewhere.” The study also is the first to evaluate the potential effect of exposure to COVID-19. Researchers are exploring if there is a relationship between a history of being infected with COVID-19 and susceptibility to the effects of harmful algal blooms exposure. The latest study involves a survey to identify the potential routes, duration and types of exposure to blooms through recreational and occupational activities. Researchers also will assess potential effects on individuals with pre-existing conditions such as asthma and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Bloodwork including liver enzymes and renal markers also will be included in this study. Algal toxin concentrations including microcystin and brevotoxin will be measured in blood, urine and nasal mucosa. The toxin levels also will be used to understand the dose-response relationships with self-reported respiratory, dermal and gastrointestinal symptoms. Urine and blood analyses will be conducted in collaboration with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is developing methodology to detect emerging algal toxins in human tissues. The study includes conducting environmental sampling of water and air to measure potential sources of exposure. Researchers have developed a bio-repository and participant registry to store the data and samples in collaboration with FAU’s Clinical Research Unit within the FAU Division of Research . The purpose is to build an ongoing infrastructure to support the team’s long-term studies on the health effects of exposure to current and emerging harmful algal blooms toxins and serve as a resource for researchers around the state. Malcolm McFarland, Ph.D., a research associate at FAU Harbor Branch, is co-principal investigator of the study. The research team also includes Michael Parsons, Ph.D., co-investigator and a professor of marine science at Florida Gulf Coast University.

Animal illnesses occurred primarily in August (2,328; 86%) and mostly involved wildlife, including a mortality event that killed at least 2,000 bats. The most commonly reported signs in animals were genitourinary (e.g., dark urine) in wildlife, followed by gastrointestinal (e.g., vomiting) and generalized (e.g., lethargy) in domestic pets. Most HAB events were classified as confirmed (85%), human illnesses as probable (89%), and animal illnesses as confirmed (74%). Download the data summary [PDF – 1 page] On This Page Highlights Background Methods Findings Overview HAB Events Human Illnesses Animal Illnesses Limitations Conclusion Background Harmful algal blooms (HABs) that result from the rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria (also referred to as blue-green algae) in natural waterbodies can harm people, animals, or the environment . HAB events of public health concern are primarily caused by microalgae (e.g., diatoms and dinoflagellates), cyanobacteria, and the toxins they can produce. HAB events, which can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature, can have public health, environmental, and economic impacts. HABs are a One Health issue—they affect the health of people, animals, and our shared environment. One Health is a collaborative and multisectoral approach that involves engagement across disciplines including public health, animal health, and environmental health. Using a One Health approach, CDC collects data about HAB events and associated human or animal illnesses through the One Health Harmful Algal Bloom System (OHHABS) to inform public health prevention efforts. In OHHABS, the term HAB event means either identification of a bloom or the detection of HAB toxins in water or food without a visual bloom. Human illnesses are reported individually. Animal illnesses are reported as single cases of illness or in groups, such as flocks of birds or schools of fish. The reporting system can link HAB event data with human or animal illness data. OHHABS uses standard definitions [PDF – 3 pages] to classify HAB events as suspected or confirmed and human or animal illness as suspected, probable, or confirmed. OHHABS is available for voluntary reporting by public health agencies and their designated environmental health or animal health partners in the United States, District of Columbia, Federated States of Micronesia, Guam, Marshall Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands. Public health agencies use standard forms to report HAB events, human cases of illness, and animal cases of illness to OHHABS. Public health agencies do not need to submit all three types of forms to participate. Data collected for HAB events include general information (e.g., observation date), geographic information, water body characteristics (e.g., salinity), observational characteristics (e.g., water color, presence or absence of scum), and laboratory testing results. Data collected for cases of illness include general demographic characteristics, exposure information, signs and symptoms, medical care, and health outcomes. OHHABS is a dynamic electronic reporting system; data within individual reports are subject to change over time. Data included in this report are from a specific point in time. Top of Page Methods This summary describes data from OHHABS for events occurring between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021. Reports were received by October 3, 2022 and reviewed by CDC using standardized data quality checks. CDC downloaded the final dataset on January 30, 2023. CDC used SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) to conduct descriptive analyses to characterize HAB events and associated human or animal cases of illness. This summary reflects a change in methodology to analyses involving environmental laboratory results. In prior summaries, a result was included as a “positive detection” if the reported concentration was greater than zero (>0) or there was no reported concentration (e.g., a toxin was reported but not the concentration). Reported concentrations of 0 were considered “non-detections” and not included. Beginning with the 2021 annual summary, a concentration >0 is required for the result to be counted as a positive detection and included in analyses. If group animal reports were missing the number of individuals affected, the number was set to two for inclusion in descriptive analyses. If group animal reports indicated deaths occurred but did not provide the number of individuals that died, the number of deaths was set to missing as this could not be extrapolated from available information. Public health agencies classified HAB events as suspected or confirmed and cases of illness as suspected, probable, or confirmed ( 2018 OHHABS case and event definitions [PDF – 3 pages] ). Animals within group animal reports were classified according to the overall classification (e.g., if a group of 10 animals was classified as “probable,” then each animal was subsequently defined as a probable case of illness). Reported signs and symptoms were classified primarily based on the organ system affected. “Generalized” refers to constitutional signs and symptoms such as headache, fever, or lethargy in humans and weakness, lethargy, or anorexia in animals. Some signs and symptoms classified as neurologic may present in other systems (e.g., ophthalmologic). Signs and symptoms reported in OHHABS are reviewed periodically to assign classifications to newly entered values. Top of Page Findings Overview During 2021, 368 HAB events were reported by 16 state jurisdictions: Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming ( Figure 1 ). These HAB events resulted in 117 human cases of illness and at least 2,715 animal cases of illness. Twenty-one groups of animals were reported, ranging in size from 2–2,000 individuals. ( Figure 2 ) Reported HAB events occurred predominantly in summer months, peaking in August (92; 25%) ( Figure 3 ) and were most often classified as confirmed (311; 85%) ( Figure 4 ). Human cases of illness occurred primarily in June (38; 33%). Animal cases of illness occurred primarily in August (2,328; 86%). Case classification differed between human and animal cases of illness; the majority (104; 89%) of human cases of illness were classified as probable and 2,018 (74%) animal illnesses as confirmed ( Figure 4 ).

Within the freshwater HAB event subset, observers most frequently noted green water color (27%), however, one or more observations of clear water were reported during 10% of these HAB events ( Figure 6 ). Scum or algal matter was observed in 199 of 218 (91%) HAB events that included information on scum presence or absence. Monitoring (65%) and citizen complaints (23%) were the most frequently reported reasons for conducting environmental testing for algal toxins or species ( Figure 7 ). Most reports (280; 76%) included environmental testing results with positive detections (>0) of cyanobacteria, algae, or toxins and almost all of these were related to freshwater HAB events (94%). Among these 280 reports, toxins were most frequently detected (186; 66%), followed by cyanobacteria or algae (121; 43%) ( Figure 8 ). Toxin testing primarily identified microcystins (166; 89%) ( Figure 9a ); multiple toxins were reported for 27 HAB events. Aphanizomenon was the genus most frequently identified during environmental testing, detected in 37 HAB events ( Figure 9b ). Pseudo-nitzschia was the only genus identified in marine coastal waters during eight HAB events.

People who became ill were exposed to HABs predominately at public outdoor areas (38%) and beaches (30%). Nearly all (89%) of the 117 people who became ill reported water and 7% reported air as a source of exposure (multiple sources were reported in 1% of illnesses). People sought care in 86 (74%) instances; over half (59%) called a poison control center, and 8% of illnesses resulted in an emergency department visit ( Table 1 ). No deaths were reported. Numerous signs and symptoms were reported; the most commonly reported types were gastrointestinal (59%), generalized (43%), and dermatologic (31%) ( Figure 11 ). Overall, diarrhea (37%) and vomiting (33%) were the most commonly reported signs and symptoms ( Table 2 ). Median time to illness onset was 12 hours (0–96; n=76) and median illness duration was 24 hours (0.50-720; n=63); 50% of ill people still exhibited signs or symptoms at the time of interview ( Table 1 ).

Most wildlife cases were classified as confirmed (76%), domestic pet cases as probable (67%), and livestock cases as suspect (60%) ( Figure 12 ). Among 48 domestic pet cases, 25 livestock cases, and 2,642 wildlife cases, the animals most affected were dogs (100%), cattle (100%), and bats (76%), respectively ( Figure 13a ). Veterinary care was provided to 59 animals, including 35 marine mammals and 24 dogs. Data describing signs of illness were available for 180 animals (100 mollusks, 46 dogs, and 34 fish). Generalized (80%), gastrointestinal (76%), and neurologic (52%) signs were most frequently reported for domestic pets ( Figure 14a ). Genitourinary (99%) and unknown (1%) signs were reported for wildlife ( Figure 14b ). Individually, vomiting (59%) and lethargy (37%) were the most commonly observed signs in reported domestic pet illnesses and dark urine in mollusks and fish (99%) was the only sign observed for wildlife ( Table 3 ). Median time to illness onset was 3.0 hours (0.02–24.0) for the 16 domestic pets with available information, and median duration of illness was 24.0 hours (0.02–72.0) for 12 domestic pets with available information. In total, 2,489 (92%) of the animals died.

States may not report information for all HAB events or illnesses due to variability in surveillance capacity, surveillance program scope, or limitations to the environmental or health data available for HAB events. Environmental testing might have been limited by availability of testing for one or more toxins. Additionally, the total number of individual animals described in this report underrepresents the total affected or that died during these events because some group animal reports did not provide these numbers or indicated that the number was an underestimate. Summarized data therefore underrepresent the total number of HAB events and illnesses that occurred within or across states. Similarly, relative contributions of HAB events in salt water, toxins identified in fresh water, and types of illnesses (e.g., domestic pets versus wildlife species), may also be affected. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on surveillance of HAB events (e.g., bloom detection and monitoring) and illnesses (e.g., exposure to HABs, healthcare seeking behavior) are not known. Top of Page Conclusion Sixteen states reported to OHHABS for 2021. The findings from this annual data summary indicate that HAB events and associated illnesses occur throughout the United States. HAB event and illness reporting primarily characterized environmental data, exposures, and outcomes associated with freshwater cyanobacterial blooms. Affected people primarily reported gastrointestinal, generalized, and dermatologic signs and symptoms, while affected animals—specifically dogs—presented with generalized, gastrointestinal, and neurologic signs. A mortality event involving at least 2,000 bats demonstrated the potential for HAB events to impact wildlife populations. Data from environmental sampling, human illnesses, and animal illnesses highlight the diversity of HAB species, toxins, and health effects associated with HAB events. A One Health approach to surveillance increases the scientific understanding and data available to characterize HAB events and inform illness prevention efforts. Acknowledgements CDC would like to thank state and local waterborne disease coordinators, epidemiologists, environmental health practitioners, laboratorians, toxicologists, and animal health practitioners, as well as other partners who were involved in investigating or reporting these data to OHHABS.

Harmful algal blooms are popping up more frequently across the U.S., and new research suggests that they may cause serious lifelong health problems. Like the algal blooms that have killed sea lions and dolphins across the Southern California coast, the cyanobacterial algal blooms found in fresh waterways throughout the state produce toxins while growing. The blooms are “alarming because it does not take a huge amount of these toxins to affect human health,” especially for people with medical conditions such as chronic liver or kidney disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, or type 2 diabetes, Saurabh Chatterjee , a professor of environmental and occupational health at UC Irvine, said.

LAKE ELSINORE, CA - AUGUST 25: In an aerial view, people fish in green water during a harmful algal bloom (HAB) of blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, at Lake Elsinore on August 25, 2022 in Lake Elsinore, California. The city has closed the lake to all activities, including fishing, swimming and boating, due to the danger of serious illness or death in humans and animals. Fueled especially by drought and hot weather, California is experiencing some of the worst HAB outbreaks in the nation with an increase of more than 464 percent outbreaks in the past five years.  (Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Cyanobacterial algal blooms The cyanobacterial algal blooms are made of bacteria, not algae, even though their blueish-green color and name may suggest otherwise, Chatterjee said. They are a kind of bacteria that researchers have identified in freshwater lakes, brackish water, and estuaries.

Skid Row 16 mins ago Police shoot man who allegedly ran at officer with knife Castaic 6 hours ago Deputy injured in fire at Pitchess Detention Center in Castaic  dies These blooms are showing up in new places and more frequently due to rising temperatures and runoff, he said. The ashes from wildfires or the fertilizer from farming enrich the soil with nutrients, and heavy rain then pushes those nutrients into bodies of water where they feed the algae, especially by the coasts, he said. While it grows, the cyanobacteria release a toxin called microcystin that hurts animals, such as the fish living in a pond or someone’s dog running along the edge of an impacted lake, Chatterjee said. Health risks in humans The blooms “ultimately affect us because many households in this country get access to drinking water from the lakes,” he said, adding that people can be exposed to cyanobacteria by jumping in contaminated water or eating an oyster that had ingested some bacteria. “There is no foolproof method to completely eliminate microcystins from drinking water at this point of time, but there are a number of studies being carried out in association with EPA as well as the state’s environmental health department to make sure that we do not have signs of bacterial toxins,” he said. Though people with underlying conditions are more likely to develop diseases after being exposed to the harmful algal blooms, Chatterjee said that anyone could be impacted. “Low doses of these toxins can actually alter the reproductive pathways in a fashion that affects not only the female reproductive system but also the male reproductive system,” he said. Research suggests that microcystin causes irregular menstrual cycles and infertility related to ovulatory disorders. Though an individual may appear healthy following an exposure, Chatterjee said that cyanobacteria can weaken one’s immune system by harming one’s gut microbiome, making it harder to fight off an illness in the future .

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images) Prevention The only public health measure people can take is advising recreational parks to close a body of water when there is a bloom, Chatterjee said. “However, you cannot do anything for the fish because you cannot tell the fish ‘Don't come into the lake and swim’ because they are there,” he added. Chatterjee said that removing algae from a lake is only a short-term solution. “There is absolutely no strategy to counter the long-term effects because, with climate change, this is going to come back year after year.” He suggested that one solution could be preventing runoff from entering bodies of water, but that “for the heat, we can't do anything unless and until we have a roadmap of the changing climate.” People should wait six months before visiting a place where there have been blooms and contact a physician if they are experiencing symptoms from an exposure, but “you can only treat the symptoms. You cannot treat the cause because you are already exposed to it,” he said.

Lynch Share Share by Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Facebook Share on Twitter LAWRENCE — A broad analysis of lake water quality across the United States reveals human-driven climate change is increasing risks of high toxin concentrations from algal blooms in U.S. lakes, posing increasing hazards to people and wild and domestic animals, including dogs. The investigation, recently published as the cover story in Nature Water, relies on data from lake-water samples from 2,804 U.S. lakes collected between 2007 and 2017 by the Environmental Protection Agency. The authors, including a researcher at the University of Kansas, use the EPA’s data to predict the likelihood that a toxin called microcystin, produced by some blue-green algal species, will spike above water quality thresholds in the years ahead. Microcystin can damage the liver in humans and can kill wild and domestic animals. “We found toxic blue-green blooms thrive under climate change conditions and warmer temperatures, particularly in the optimal temperature range of 20 to 25 degrees Celsius, with the highest levels at about 22 degrees Celsius, or 72 degrees Fahrenheit,” said co-author Ted Harris, assistant research professor with the Kansas Biological Survey & Center for Ecological Researchat KU. “It's clear regions with a history of fewer toxic blooms are likely to experience an increase in such occurrences due to climate change. High-nutrient lakes, which serve as a fuel source for these blooms, are particularly vulnerable to this trend.” Harris’ collaborators were lead author Julian Merder, along with Anna Michalak and Gang Zhao of the Carnegie Institution for Science, as well as Dimitrios Stasinopoulos and Robert Rigby of the University of Greenwich. Among the team’s other key findings: Climate change forecasts show a northward shift in areas that will be at higher risk for algal blooms, particularly the northern Great Plains and northwestern United States. Parts of the U.S. with fewer toxic blooms on record are likely to see more of them because of climate change. Many agricultural regions with high-nutrient lakes will see more frequent temperatures ideal for algal blooms, with associated risks for drinking water sources, recreational activities and human and animal health. Harris said public health officials and lake visitors should be mindful of conditions that foster algal blooms — and dog owners in particular should pay attention to the findings. “The negative effects of these toxins, particularly those affecting the liver, can lead to death, with rare cases of human fatalities,” he said. “However, more commonly, animals, especially dogs, are adversely affected. Blue-green algae differ from other algae as they can float due to small buoyant structures within them. This behavior causes them to be pushed downwind and accumulate near coasts, often where launching ramps are located, and where people take their dogs. This is also where toxin accumulation is more likely.” As an example, Harris recounted a significant toxic bloom at Milford Reservoir in Kansas in 2011 that led public officials to warn “complaints after recreational exposure include vomiting, diarrhea, skin rashes, eye irritation and respiratory symptoms. These toxins also caused deaths in pets.” Harris specializes in studying algal blooms, including work monitoring harmful algal bloom distribution, abundance and toxicity. He also works to develop modeling techniques for predicting and forecasting harmful cyanobacterial blooms. He said the statistical findings in the paper lined up with his experiences doing fieldwork. “On this paper I served as the bloom expert,” he said. “I made sure our results were robust and that we were saying things that we find in general to be true in the field.” Photo: Blue-green algae scums washing up on shore of Milford Reservior, Kansas, in 2017.

Drew Pendleton July 17, 2023 4:15 am If the water in Idaho’s rivers and lakes smells bad, looks foamy or thick (like paint was spilled into the water), appears scummy, blue-green, or brownish-red in color, stay out, health officials advise. (Courtesy of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) As temperatures increase, so does the likelihood of a cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom, or cyanoHAB. CyanoHABs are caused by cyanobacteria, and the toxins they produce are harmful to humans, pets, livestock and wildlife. CyanoHABs can change and increase rapidly if conditions are right. They favor warm water, sunlight and specific nutrients in the water. These blooms can last throughout the summer into fall. How to report an algal bloom in Idaho Online: Department of Environmental Quality Online form By phone: 866-671-5385 By email: [email protected] The Idaho Department of Environmental Quality samples and analyzes Idaho water bodies for cyanoHABs. The test results are provided to the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and local public health districts, and they decide if a health advisory should be issued. For information on advisories, visit the DHW’s Idaho Recreational Water Advisories map for more information. The severity of symptoms depends on how a person or animal was exposed, how long they were exposed and the toxin type. Health effects for people Exposure to cyanobacteria and their toxins makes people sick. People are exposed by swimming in or swallowing contaminated water and breathing in tiny droplets in the air that contain toxins. Symptoms include skin irritation or rashes, blisters, lung irritation, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and vomiting; and they can lead to liver, kidney and nervous system damage. Health effects for pets (animals, livestock, and wildlife) Pets are most often exposed by drinking and swallowing contaminated water and licking the toxins off their fur. The fur of animals can collect a large amount of toxin, making it very dangerous for pets. Symptoms include excess drooling, vomiting, diarrhea, foaming at the mouth, jaundice, blood in urine or dark urine, stumbling, abdominal tenderness and loss of appetite. How to protect yourself, your family, and your pets Not all cyanoHABs are visible, and not all bodies of water are sampled. Therefore, the public is not always notified of all blooms throughout the state or the toxins they might be producing. When planning recreational activities in any body of water in Idaho, visit the DEQ and DHW websites for information, and always use caution by doing the following: If the water smells bad, looks foamy or thick (like paint was spilled into the water), appears scummy, blue-green, or brownish-red in color, stay out. If an advisory is posted, keep yourself, family, and pets out of the water. If an advisory is in place: Avoid swimming, wading, or other contact with the water. Take extra care to ensure children do not drink or get the water on them. Ensure pets and livestock do not drink or go into the water. If they have contact with the water, clean skin, hide, or fur with clean water right away. Do not drink or cook with the water. Boiling or filtering the water does not remove the toxins and can increase the risk of becoming sick. Wash hands thoroughly in clean water after handling fish or objects from the water. If you choose to eat fish from the water, clean and wash fish thoroughly in uncontaminated water. Filet the fish, and remove all fat, skin, and internal organs before cooking. Cyanotoxins can build up in fish, and the risk to people is unknown. Watch for symptoms. If you touch or swim in the water or breathe in water droplets, you might experience a rash, hives, red eyes, wheezing, coughing, or shortness of breath. If you swallow the water, you might have stomach pain, diarrhea or vomiting. You might have a headache, muscle weakness or dizziness. If your liver is damaged, your skin might turn yellow, and you will have dark urine. If you think you might be sick from cyanotoxin, consult your health care provider or call the poison center at 1-800-222-1222. Notify [email protected] . Monitor media reports and the Department of Health and Welfare’s website for health advisories. As a general rule for anglers, swimmers, dog walkers, and anyone eager to jump into their favorite body of water, if a health advisory is in place, it should not be considered free and clear until that advisory is removed from the Idaho Recreational Water Health Advisories map . The bottom line for Idaho’s waterways is that cyanobacteria will not immediately disappear with cold weather and will remain in the surface water for long periods of time.

Satellite images released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA on Wednesday (July 5) show cyanobacterial blooms forming along coastal areas. NOAA satellite images from July 5, 2023 show harmful algal blooms forming in the western basin of Lake Erie. (Photo courtesy of NOAA) Researchers from the University of Michigan based Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) were taking samples of Lake Erie water on the same day. One of the sampling sites was covered with what look to be cyanobaterial blooms –sometimes called blue-green algae. Andrew Camilleri with CIGLR leans of the side of a NOAA vessel to take a sample of what appeared to by cyanobacterial blooms on Wednesday, July 5, 2023. (Photo Credit: Lester Graham/Michigan Radio) Andrew Camilleri with CIGLR was surprised to find the blooms this early in the summer. Typically, they don’t start forming until August and some years as late as September or early October. The harmful algal blooms were located on the eastern side of Maumee Bay near Toledo. “It’s really shallow there. And so, if you do get a rain, those nearshore areas are certainly going to warm up first and then also be very responsive to that near-shore runoff,” said Ed Verhamme with Limno Tech. That company places environmental data buoys in the lake to monitor conditions. He said recent rains might have stirred up phosphorous which accumulated near the bay which primarily originated from agricultural sources in the Maumee River watershed. “This year we had hot, dry conditions. But, that doesn’t mean that a lot of phosphorus wasn’t delivered before that happened. So, I think it’s just been this spring warm up and how stagnant the water has been with the warm weather we’ve had,” Verhamme said. A NOAA forecast issued June 29 projected a “smaller-than-average” bloom. Rick Stumpf with NOAA said the severity of the bloom was expected to be around “3.” Last year’s harmful algal bloom severity was 6.8. The highest severity index was 10.5 in 2015. “The forecast doesn’t consider warm months or cold months or wet last week and dry next week,” Verhamme said. Ed Verhamme standing amongst some of the environmental data collecting buoys at Limno Tech. (Photo Credit: Lester Graham/Michigan Radio) He described the forecast as looking at the seasonal load of phosphorus in making its forecast for the peak expanse of the harmful algal bloom. Based on a very dry May and cooler weather in the spring, the conditions did not indicate a severe bloom. Heavy rains in the spring can wash phosphorus loads downstream and those heavy rains didn’t develop this year. Watching from the research vessel, the crew spotted a boat towing an inner tube with people on it through the green soup of cyanobacterial blooms on Wednesday. During the forecast last week, Stumpf warned, “Keep yourself, your kids, and your dog out of the scum-like blooms or anywhere the water looks green.” As reported last week, the blooms can release a toxin that damages the liver which poses a risk to people or animals that come into contact with it.

When that summertime heat gets to you, you want nothing more than to spend the day in the water. But when you get there... the water just looks.... a little off. The surface water is discolored, there’s a stinky smell in the air, and there are patches of mat-like accumulations on the shoreline. Do you try to wade through the layer of yuck to get to a clear spot or should you just stay out? Your dogs don't care about cleanliness, maybe it's okay for them? Unfortunately, you, my friend, are looking at a harmful algal bloom (HAB). You and your pets should stay away! Did You Know? Each year, thousands of harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur within U.S. waters. HABs have been reported in parks and can be dangerous to fish, wildlife, pets, aquatic vegetation, and humans. What is a Harmful Algal Bloom? Sunny days, warm water, and increased nutrients are the perfect recipe to grow algae. When algae grow rapidly, it’s called an algal bloom. Some algae growth is important to a healthy ecosystem. Many animals eat algae, and most species of algae are not dangerous. Some species of algae, however, are toxic to humans, pets, wildlife, and the environment. When these algae bloom, it’s called a harmful algal bloom (HAB). What You Can Do Climate change and increased lawn and agricultural runoff into waters have created ideal conditions for HABs, and HABs are occurring more often in more places than ever before. But the good news is there are precautions you can take to keep you and your pets safe, and you can help prevent HABs in your own backyard. NPS Photo Preventing HABs in Your Community Reduce your use of fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides on your lawn or garden. Plant native plants to minimize the need for fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides. (Bonus: This also helps pollinators and native plants are easier to keep alive!) Pick up and properly dispose of pet waste . Staying Safe Around HABs If a HAB may be present: Avoid contact with algae. Use caution when contacting water and wash with clean water afterwards. Keep pets, children, and livestock away from water. Do not let pets or livestock drink water or eat floating or dried algae. Discard fish guts and clean fillets with clean water before cooking. Do not eat shellfish collected from this water. Contact your doctor or veterinarian if you or your pet have unexplained illness or signs of poisoning after contact with algae. Report human illnesses to publichealthprogram@nps.gov. When in doubt, stay out! If a HAB is present: Do not touch, swim in, or drink the water. In case of contact wash with soap and clean water. Keep pets away from the water. Do not use this water for drinking or cooking. Boiling and filtering will not make this water safe. Do not eat fish or shellfish from this water. Contact your doctor or veterinarian if you or your pet have unexplained illness or signs of poisoning after contact with algae. Report human illnesses to publichealthprogram@nps.gov. Pass It On! Did you learn something new? Pass it on! Protecting our ecosystems is a job for us all, but there’s no way for everyone to be an expert in everything. That’s why sharing knowledge is so important!

Harmful Algal Blooms Some species of algae are toxic to humans, pets, wildlife, and the environment. When these algae bloom, it's called a harmful algal bloom (HAB). Sunny days, warm water, and increased nutirents are the perfect recipe to grow algae. HABs can occur in freshwater or saltwater. When in doubt, stay out! Avoid contact with algae. Wash with soap and clean water if you come in contacts. Don't eat fish or shellfish from the water. Don't let pets drink the water or eat the algal mats. Do not drink.

Search Home News News Releases Castaic Lake Algal Bloom at Danger Advisory Print Page Castaic Lake Algal Bloom at Danger Advisory Published: Sep 26, 2023 Boaters launch from Castaic Lake Boat Launch Ramp at Castaic Lake, a reservoir formed by Castaic Dam on Castaic Creek, in the Sierra Pelona Mountains of northwestern Los Angeles County, California. Photo taken May 11, 2023. Today, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) urges people to avoid physical contact with water at Castaic Lake in Los Angeles County until further notice due to the presence of blue-green algae. People should also avoid eating fish or shellfish from the lake. This week’s lab results show an increase in toxin levels. A danger advisory was put in place today, and remains in effect for the entire Castaic Lake, except Castaic Lagoon, until further notice. It is advised for people and pets to stay out of the water and avoid contact with algal scum in the water or on shore. Boating is allowed, but water-contact recreation and sporting activities are not considered safe due to potential adverse health effects. For latest conditions and d anger advisory information, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website . Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats, and scum, form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Take care that pets and livestock do not drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algal blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat mussels or other bivalves collected from these areas. No fish should be consumed under a danger advisory. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

what to know when waterfowl hunting this fall Salt Lake City — Many of Utah's general-season waterfowl hunts open on Saturday, Oct. 7, and hunters across the state will be getting out on the water to harvest migrating geese and ducks. While they are prepared with decoys, dogs and ammunition, some hunters may not be as prepared to recognize and avoid harmful algal blooms on some Utah waterbodies. As of Friday, Sept. 29, there were 24 waterbodies under warning and danger advisories across Utah. On Oct. 31, the Utah Division of Water Quality will stop monitoring for harmful algal blooms as temperatures continue to decrease and weather conditions worsen during the fall and winter. However, despite some misconceptions that harmful algal blooms only occur during hot summer weather, they can persist throughout the fall and winter and continue to pose a potential threat to humans and pets. ""Beginning at the end of October, some active advisories will be lifted, and signs and website posts will start to come down,"" Utah Division of Water Quality Environmental Scientist Dr. Hannah Bonner said. ""However, it's essential to know that these blooms can continue in colder weather. People should know what to look for , and when in doubt, keep your pets and hunting dogs out of the water."" Blooms form when naturally occurring cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, multiply to high densities and form visible water discoloration, scum and mats. Harmful algal blooms can look like pea soup, spilled paint, grass clippings or water that has a green or blue-green hue. Cyanobacteria can produce several kinds of toxins that can affect liver, nerve and skin tissue. If you suspect a harmful algal bloom in the water, stay out of the water and avoid any contact with water or scum. Be sure to clean waterfowl and fish well with fresh water, and discard all guts. Hunters should also keep their dogs away if they suspect a harmful algal bloom, as the toxins have proven to be fatal in pets. Dogs can be exposed to toxins by skin contact with water that is contaminated with cyanobacteria or toxins, by swallowing water or by licking the water off their fur or hair. If you suspect your pet has been exposed to a harmful algal bloom, seek immediate care from your veterinarian. Even with proper veterinary care, most exposures are fatal. Prevention is the best way to protect your pet. Suspected harmful algal blooms can be reported to DWQ by calling 801-536-4123 . Find more information about harmful algal blooms at habs.utah.gov .

(Image credit: Zachary Haslick, Aerial Associates Photography Inc.) NOAA and its research partners are forecasting that western Lake Erie will experience a smaller-than-average harmful algal bloom (HAB) this summer, which would result in a less severe bloom than 2022. This year’s bloom is expected to measure 3, with a potential range of 2 - 4.5 on the severity index — whereas last year’s bloom was measured at a 6.8. The index is based on the bloom’s biomass — the amount of algae — during the peak 30 days of the bloom. An index above 5 indicates more severe blooms. Blooms over 7 are particularly severe, with extensive scum formation and coverage affecting the lake. The largest blooms occurred in 2011, with a severity index of 10, and 2015, with a severity index of 10.5. “The harmful algal bloom forecast translates the latest science into actionable information for our partners and the public,” said NOAA Chief Scientist Sarah Kapnick, Ph.D. “As we move into the summer season, having accurate, reliable information about this year’s expected bloom will help protect public health and economic activity for communities along Lake Erie.” Lake Erie HABs consisting of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, are capable of producing microcystin, a known liver toxin which poses a risk to human and wildlife health. Such blooms may force cities and local governments to treat drinking water, close beaches and can harm vital local economies by preventing people from fishing, swimming, boating and visiting the shoreline. The size of a bloom isn’t necessarily an indication of how toxic it is. For example, the toxins in a large bloom may not be as concentrated as in a smaller bloom. Each algal bloom is unique in terms of size, toxicity and ultimately its impact on local communities. “By consistently improving the science behind our forecasts, we’re giving Great Lakes communities the information they need to plan for blooms of varying severity,” said NOAA’s National Ocean Service director Nicole LeBoeuf. “Understanding and addressing hazards such as harmful algal blooms can help us ensure that the Great Lakes are an engine of the blue economy.” The National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science’s (NCCOS) Lake Erie HAB Forecast website provides predictions and visualizations of the bloom’s location and movement on the lake’s surface, as well as where the bloom is located within the water column . This information is especially helpful to water treatment plant operators, because intake structures are usually located below the surface, so the risk of toxins in their source water may be greater when these cells sink. “NCCOS’s Lake Erie HAB Forecast continues to be a valuable resource for Lake Erie residents, visitors and the state,” said Christopher Winslow, Ph.D., director of Ohio Sea Grant and Stone Laboratory. “This NOAA forecast and the research being conducted by academic institutions and both state and federal agencies to understand blooms and nutrient runoff will continue to guide efforts to address these summer bloom events.” Forecast details NOAA expects a start of the visible bloom in mid-to-late July. The duration of the bloom depends on the frequency of wind events in September, which cannot be predicted this far in advance. The bloom will remain mostly in areas of the lake’s western basin. The central and eastern basins of the lake are usually unaffected, although localized blooms may occur around some of the rivers after summer rainstorms. The range in forecasted severity reflects the uncertainty in forecasting precipitation, particularly for July. Larger rain events during the summer could result in increased river flow and a higher severity index. NOAA will issue a seasonal forecast update in early August based on observed rainfall in the western basin watershed. ""While this spring has been quite dry, the Lake received a large nutrient load in March, which will produce at least a mild bloom this summer,” said Richard Stumpf, Ph.D., NCCOS’s lead scientist for the seasonal Lake Erie bloom forecast. “However, like recent years, we have a potential of additional nutrient load in July, which could lead to a moderate bloom."" Bloom severity forecast compared to previous years. The wide red bar is the likely range of severity based on the different models used and reflect uncertainty in the July total bioavailable phosphorus (TBP) load. A severity below 3 is the goal of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement (GLWQA). (Image credit: NOAA NCCOS HAB Forecasting) Download Image The Lake Erie forecast is part of a NOAA Ecological Forecasting initiative that aims to deliver accurate, relevant, timely and reliable ecological forecasts directly to coastal resource managers, public health officials and the public. In addition to the early season projections from NOAA and its partners, NOAA also issues HAB forecasts during the bloom season. These forecasts provide the current extent and 5-day outlooks of where the bloom will travel and what concentrations are likely to be seen, allowing local decision-makers to make informed management decisions. NOAA is actively developing tools to detect and predict how toxic blooms will be. Nutrient load data for the forecasts came from Heidelberg University in Ohio, and the various forecast models are run by NCCOS, the University of Michigan, North Carolina State University, LimnoTech, Stanford University and the Carnegie Institution for Science.

In recent years, this estuary has experienced numerous phytoplankton bloom events due to increased seasonal temperatures coupled with environmental impacts. Algal blooms produce a myriad of small organic molecules, many of which can be toxic to humans and animals. Among these phycotoxin producers is Microcystis aeruginosa , a freshwater cyanobacterium, which can be found in the Southern IRL. Measurable amounts of microcystins have been found in nasal swabs of people who live and work near the area, although finding microcystins in mucosal membranes may be evidence that the body is doing its job to eliminate them. To help uncover potential human health hazards associated with harmful algae blooms in the IRL, researchers from Florida Atlantic University ’s Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute collected water samples from 20 sites within the lagoon during wet and dry seasons over a three-year period. The samples were extracted to concentrate organic molecules and these extracts were used in testing. To identify the presence of known or emerging toxins, researchers used a panel of immortalized human cell lines corresponding to the liver, kidney and brain to measure cytotoxicity. Human cell lines engineered to express ion transporters, red blood cells, and the activity against a protein phosphatase enzyme, also were used in the study. These cells and biological activities were selected as they are known to be affected by algal toxins and show unique patterns of activity for known toxins. Samples were tested at high concentrations to detect as many metabolites as possible, and those that presented more than 50 percent cytotoxicity were considered active. Samples that exhibited high toxicity were further subjected to liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry analysis to assess the metabolites present in the sample. Results of the study, published in the journal Toxins , show that each control toxin induced a consistent pattern of cytotoxicity in the panel of human cell lines assayed. During blooms, cytotoxicity due to a single type of toxin was obvious from this pattern. In the absence of blooms, the observed cytotoxicity reflected either a mixture of toxins or it was caused by an unidentified toxin. “The most interesting observation from our study is that with the cell lines used, we could follow the patterns of known toxins,” said Esther Guzmán , Ph.D., corresponding author and a research professor at FAU Harbor Branch. “Known toxins were seen only during blooms. Because cell toxicity was seen in the absence of blooms, it suggests that there might be either emergent toxins or a combination of toxins present at those times. Our findings suggest that other toxins with the potential to be harmful to human health may be present in the lagoon.” Among the study findings, the most northern sites of the lagoon exhibited less toxicity than sites to the south. Cytotoxic blooms were seen both in the south ( Microcystis ) and the north ( Pyrodinium ) of the lagoon. In the absence of blooms, South Fork, South Fork 2, North Fork and Middle Estuary (sites one to four) in the Southern IRL and Banana River, and North Banana River (NASA) (sites 14 and 15) in the Northern IRL appeared to have the most cytotoxicity during the time of the assessment. In contrast, Jensen, Fort Pierce Inlet, Harbor Branch Link Port Canal, Vero Beach Land/Ocean Biogeochemical Observatory, and Vero Beach Barber Bridge (sites six to 10) appeared healthier as there were few samples with cytotoxicity above 50 percent in these sites, although there was statistically significant variation in these sites. “A major question we sought to answer in this study was whether there are unrecognized toxins or other signaling molecules associated with harmful algal blooms in the lagoon,” said Amy Wright , Ph.D., co-author and a research professor, FAU Harbor Branch. “The data collected to date suggest that this is indeed the case. Importantly, using an assay panel to assess the presence of toxic materials could allow for better monitoring of human health impacts, especially from emerging toxins within the system.” The researchers note that microcystins are primarily a threat to human health in the lagoon during blooms, and because of the necessity of active transport, the toxin would need to be ingested or inhaled to present a threat to humans. “Ingestion can be avoided by filtering water through activated charcoal,” said Guzmán. “Similarly, effects due to inhalation are effectively blocked by the mucus membrane, which traps toxins that are subsequently eliminated through coughing. However, pet and wildlife exposures can still occur.” Study co-authors Tara A.

Establishing an Algal Toxin Rule and Regulatory Program in Rhode Island, an Informal Case Study As the severity and impact of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) increasingly pose risk to human health, one frequent topic of discussion is when and/or how to adopt regulations accordingly, and in what capacity. The numerous factors that require consideration – agency jurisdiction, criteria thresholds, balancing bloom/toxin prioritization, the need for programmatic support, etc. – can be challenging barriers to address without the established federal counterparts that are in place for many other drinking water rules and programs. In 2019, Rhode Island was one of the earliest states to establish a HAB/cyanotoxin rule in the state public drinking water regulations, which also required the development of surrounding program infrastructure. This presentation serves as a brief, small-scale case study of a state-level Algal Toxin program from its inception onward, including topics such as an overview of the rule’s regulatory language, toxin selection and health limits, implementation, challenges, and other resources/information. Presenter: Shannon Harrower-Nakama, Rhode Island Department of Health. Shannon is an environmental scientist with the Rhode Island Department of Health’s Center for Drinking Water Quality. She currently serves as the center’s Source Water Protection Program lead and manages the Algal Toxin Rule under the state’s public water system regulations. Part of her role has been to implement the Algal Toxin Rule from the point it was first incorporated in 2019. and establish the Rule’s program from the ground up. She also worked to develop strong collaborative partnerships with other agencies, such as Rhode Island’s Department of Environmental Management’s surface water monitoring and protection programs, which have been integral to the program’s success. 2. Insights on Harmful Algal Bloom Dynamics in Urban Lakes & Introduction to Benthic Sample Preparation Algae are a natural component of aquatic ecosystems; however, when present in large quantities as ""blooms"", they can pose a significant potential threat to human and ecological health. These harmful algal blooms (HABs) are often composed of microorganisms known as cyanobacteria, some of which have the potential to produce toxins that can cause adverse health effects in humans and animals through the contamination of waterways used for recreational purposes and as drinking water supplies. HABs are understudied in the urban environment. This presentation discusses the investigation of urban lakes in three metropolitan areas to determine if there are parameters that are unique to these lakes and investigate the correlation between urban watershed characteristics and cyanobacterial HABs. Presenters: Heath Mash, EPA Office of Research and Development. Heath is a chemist with EPA’s Office of Research and Development, Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response, where he specializes in analytical chemistry with regards to drinking water treatment. In addition to cyanobacterial toxins work, his work has included estrogenic and androgenic compounds and disinfection byproduct studies. Toby Sanan, EPA Office of Research and Development. Toby is a research chemist with EPA’s Office of Research and Development, Center for Environmental Solutions and Emergency Response, where he has been working in the area of analytical method development for over ten years. Presently his research is focused on detecting and quantifying contaminants of emerging concern, including PFAS and cyanobacterial toxins, using mass spectrometric techniques including high resolution and non-targeted methods. He is leading the EPA’s effort to develop a total oxidizable precursor assay method for helping to fill the mass gap in PFAS measurement and is also involved in work related to the study of harmful cyanobacteria and their associated toxins.

Pacific Salmon Red Snapper News Toxic Algal Bloom Suspected in Dolphin and Sea Lion Deaths in Southern California June 16, 2023 Stranding Network asks beachgoers to keep a safe distance and report strandings. Feature Story | West Coast Deceased dolphin as a result of domoic acid poisoning. Credit: Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute The rapid growth of harmful algae along parts of the Southern California Coast is believed to have killed hundreds of California sea lions and close to 60 dolphins in the first weeks of June. The Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute has fielded more than 1,000 reports of sick and dead marine mammals from June 8 through June 14, said Ruth Dover, co-founder and Managing Director. The Institute is part of the West Coast Marine Mammal Stranding Network , which is coordinated by NOAA Fisheries and responds to live marine mammal strandings in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. “We are managing more than 200 reports of marine mammals in distress each day,” Dover said. “We are doing the best we can to keep up with the intense pace. Please continue to report all sick and injured marine mammals as we are getting to as many animals as we can, as quickly as we can, each day.” The rapid growth of the algae Pseudo-nitzschia causes the production of a neurotoxin called domoic acid. This leads to animal strandings, as the toxin is transferred into the marine food web. Seabirds and marine mammals, such as sea lions and dolphins, ingest the toxin when they eat affected prey. Stranding responders believe domoic acid is behind the deaths given the neurological symptoms exhibited by the animals. They have collected tissue samples for testing to confirm. 3-day forecast of domoic acid concentrations along the California Coast provided by the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System. The darker red reflects the areas most likely to exceed the threshold for a Harmful Algal Bloom. Steer Clear of Stranded Animals Forecasts provided by NOAA CoastWatch and the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System show high concentrations of domoic acid from Orange County north to San Luis Obispo County. Concentrations are especially high around Santa Barbara and Ventura counties. The toxin can cause seizures, brain damage, and death. Domoic acid does not affect humans unless they consume it in contaminated food items. “I have never seen anything this intense in terms of the numbers of animals in my 20 years of responding to strandings in this area,” said Michelle Berman Kowalewski, founder and Director of the Channel Islands Cetacean Research Unit . Also part of the Marine Mammal Stranding Network, its team examines and collects samples from dead dolphins and whales in Ventura, Santa Barbara, and San Luis Obispo counties. Many of the dolphins have stranded alive and then died, she said. Several of the dolphins and many of the sea lions were pregnant females. Beachgoers should stay clear of stranded animals and keep their pets away from marine mammals. These animals can carry the toxin as well as other diseases that may be harmful to pets. “We are fortunate to have very dedicated responders who are doing their best to respond to these cases, but we also need help from the public to keep a safe distance and let the trained teams do their work,” said Justin Viezbicke, California Stranding Coordinator in NOAA Fisheries’ West Coast Region. Deceased dolphin and California sea lions nearby showing symptoms of domoic acid poisoning. Credit: Staci Kaye-Carr, Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute Concentrations Increasing Offshore Seasonal outbreaks of domoic acid poisoning are common along the California coast. Ocean conditions favoring the algae sometimes lead to more widespread outbreaks involving hundreds of animals. Domoic acid does not affect humans unless they consume it in contaminated food items (many of which are prey of marine mammals). Finfish, shellfish, and crustaceans are regularly tested for domoic acid, which in humans can cause Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning. The spread of domoic acid this year appears to include more offshore areas unlike an episode last year , when the neurotoxin was closer to the shoreline and primarily affected sea lions. The dolphins may reflect an even further offshore distribution of the toxin this year, Viezbicke said, particularly since the nearshore sampling sites are not indicating blooms of Pseudo-nitzschia according to the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System Harmful Algal Bloom Mapping and Alert Program. Tests of tissue samples collected from the affected animals may help understand how the toxin is spreading and whether any other factors such as illness may be involved, but these analyses take time. “We are trying to learn as much as we can as fast as we can,” Kowalewski said. “As difficult as it is to see these animals die, we want to gather information to help understand how and why this is happening the way it is.” Stranded sea lions, dolphins, and other marine mammals can  be reported to the West Coast Region Stranding Hotline: (866) 767-6114. For stranded live animals in Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties, residents should call Channel Islands Marine & Wildlife Institute’s Rescue Hotline at (805) 567-1505. For dead whales and dolphins in those counties, people should call Channel Island Cetacean Research Unit at (805) 500-6220.

The tool has been in use by the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission for two bloom seasons, serving to predict the probability of HABs based on river flow conditions and as a water data monitoring utility. The tool is accessible to the public at url: https://orsanco-hab.shinyapps.io/shiny-ohio-river/ This presentation also provides an overview of the science of large river HABs and the historical data that was used to develop a risk characterization framework and then a probabilistic prediction of HABs for 20 locations spanning the entire length of the Ohio River. Next, a general overview of the web-based application will be given, including details about data acquisition, data management, and the underlying statistical models. Finally, perspectives on using the tool to actively monitor the river’s water quality and make decisions about HAB sampling and risk communication will be given by the tool’s primary user.

Diverse microbial interactions regulate bloom dynamics. At the single-cell level, interactions between microorganisms are mediated by small molecules in the chemical crosstalk that determines the type of interaction, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. Algae interact with viruses, bacteria, parasites, grazers and other algae to modulate algal cell fate, and these interactions are dependent on the environmental context. Recent advances in mass spectrometry and single-cell technologies have led to the discovery of a growing number of infochemicals — metabolites that convey information — revealing the ability of algal cells to govern biotic interactions in the ocean. The diversity of infochemicals seems to account for the specificity in cellular response during microbial communication. Given the immense impact of algal blooms on biogeochemical cycles and climate regulation, a major challenge is to elucidate how microscale interactions control the fate of carbon and the recycling of major elements in the ocean. In this Review, we discuss microbial interactions and the role of infochemicals in algal blooms. We further explore factors that can impact microbial interactions and the available tools to decipher them in the natural environment.

This study analyzed the temporal and spatial changes of harmful algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay from 2000 to 2022 using the Floating Algae Index (FAI) calculated from MODIS (2000–2022) and Sentinel-2 (2015–2022) satellite image datasets. The calculation results of the image datasets were compared. The frequency of planktonic algal outbreaks was low and constant until 2017, but has increased annually since then. Algae blooms are most common in the summer and primarily concentrated along the bay’s coast, middle, and mouth, with obvious seasonal and spatial distribution characteristics. Several factors influencing algal outbreaks were identified, including sea surface temperature, wind speed, air pressure, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen and phosphorus ratios, chemical oxygen demand, and petroleum pollutants. Algal bloom outbreaks in Jiaozhou Bay are expected to remain high in 2023. The findings provide crucial information for water quality management and future algal outbreak prediction and prevention in Jiaozhou Bay.

These ecological issues not only disturb the equilibrium of aquatic ecosystems but also present a substantial peril to human health and the economy. The ramifications of algal bloom outbreaks can have significant implications, including the occurrence of fish mortality, the demise of aquatic vegetation, and the deterioration of water quality. The decomposition of algal blooms can lead to oxygen depletion and the discharge of perilous substances, exacerbating their adverse impacts on the aquatic ecosystem. Research indicates that optical observation techniques are effective instruments for investigating and monitoring Harmful Algal Blooms 3 , 4 . Utilizing satellite imagery for monitoring planktonic algae has proven to be a valuable tool in improving our understanding of the mechanisms that cause algal outbreaks 5 . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that ocean color indices derived from spectral band differences reliably provide information on algal outbreaks in both open and coastal waters 3 . In recent years, Jiaozhou Bay, situated in the central Yellow Sea of China and on the southern coast of the Jiaodong Peninsula, has experienced frequent occurrences of green algae outbreaks. These outbreaks have had enduring impacts on the coastal carbon cycle and ecosystem 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 . In addition, the bay has become significantly impacted by industrial and domestic refuse discharges as a result of the expansion of economic activities and population. Therefore, nutrient concentrations in the bay have considerably increased, particularly from the Licun and Dagu rivers 10 . The high risk of harmful algal bloomsin Jiaozhou Bay, similar to the Gulf of Mexico, is mainly attributed to the bay’s rich nutrients and frequent water exchange with the Yellow Sea 11 .It has been found that the chlorophyll a concentration in the Jiaozhou Bay region is higher in summer, further corroborating the occurrence of algal blooms in the region 12 . The significant changes in the shoreline of Jiaozhou Bay and the reduction of the bay area and tidal prism have led to a decrease in hydrodynamics, hindering the diffusion of nutrients within the bay but accelerating their accumulation, thus contributing to the emergence of planktonic algal blooms 13 . Earlier research on the community structure and species of planktonic algae in Jiaozhou Bay involved collecting samples and performing microscopic observations for classification and identification 14 , 15 . However, remote sensing satellites can cover vast areas of seas and lakes, providing high spatial and temporal resolution data for timely detection and monitoring of algal bloom distribution, extent, and changes 16 , 17 . The Floating Algae Index (FAI) has been shown to provide superior estimates of algal bloom coverage 13 , 18 . Several studies are currently using optical remote sensing satellites and the FAI index to monitor algal bloom areas in lakes such as Taihu Lake, Dianchi Lake, and Chaohu Lake 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 . However, few studies have focused on the surveillance of planktonic algae in semi-enclosed bays like Jiaozhou Bay. In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of algal blooms in the Jiaozhou Bay region from 2000 to 2022 were inverted using MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The study focuses on the following major issues: (1) The algal bloom extraction methods were constructed using the Google Earth Engine cloud platform (GEE) based on MODIS and Sentinel-2 datasets for the periods of 2000–2022 and 2015–2022, respectively. Algal bloom areas were extracted and the temporal and spatial changes of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay from 2000 to 2022 were analyzed. (2) The causes of the algal bloom in Jiaozhou Bay were investigated using meteorological and nutrient factors, as well as regression analysis. (3) Deep neural network (DNN) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model prediction methods were used to model and predict the change of algal area in Jiaozhou Bay (Supplementary information). Methods Study area Jiaozhou Bay ( \(120^\circ \;10^{\prime} - 120^\circ \;37^{\prime}{\text{E}},\;36^\circ \;06^{\prime} - 36^\circ \;25^{\prime}{\text{W}}\) ), located in the central Yellow Sea of China, is a semi-enclosed bay that covers the southern coast of the Jiaodong Peninsula in Qingdao, Shandong Province.The bay has a near-trumpet shape, with a maximum length of about 40 km in the north-south direction and a maximum width of about 28 km in the east-west direction. Its average depth is 7 m and its maximum depth is 64 m. With a total area of 438 km 2 , Jiaozhou Bay is the third-largest bay in China (Fig. 1 ). Due to its monsoon climate, the bay experiences the southeast monsoon in summer and the northwest monsoon in winter. Several small-scale circulation currents, such as a counter-current and a rotating current, are caused by the influence of the Yellow Sea Current on the bay. Jiaozhou Bay is a typical eutrophic ecosystem, where the chlorophyll a concentration is highest in the bay’s north-eastern and north-western regions and progressively decreases southward. August marks the annual maximum and maximal fluctuations of chlorophyll a 23 . The total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratios in the solid phase of Jiaozhou Bay sediments increase progressively, primarily as a result of the extensive pollution from human inputs via river discharges 24 . Concentrations of phytoplankton are greatest in the northwestern and northern regions of the bay, near the river headwaters, and decrease with increasing depth from the inner to the outer bay. Due to nutrient accumulation under south-eastern wind conditions, phytoplankton epidemics may occur near the northwestern coast 25 . Over the past three decades, Jiaozhou Bay has experienced a considerable increase in pollutants, resulting in a decline in water quality 26 .

Full size image Data MODIS data The MOD09GA Version 6.1 product is a remote sensing data product collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on board a satellite. It captures a single image of the Earth’s surface once per day with a spatial resolution of 500 meters. In this study, we selected MOD09GA.061 Terra Surface Reflectance Daily Global 500-meter satellite data from January 2000 to November 2022 to examine the evolution of algal blooms in the Jiaozhou Bay region. We obtained a total of 8216 images through data selection in Google Earth Engine and used them as one of our data sources. The data were obtained from the Earth Engine Data Catalog platform( https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MOD09GA ). Sentinel-2 data Sentinel-2 is a high-resolution multispectral imaging satellite equipped with a Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI). It comprises two identical satellites, Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, which operate simultaneously 27 . The satellite has a spatial resolution of 10 meters and a temporal resolution of 5 days, with each satellite observing every 10 days and alternating. The data were obtained from the Earth Engine Data Catalog platform( https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2 ). In this study, 460 scenes of Level-1C data from August 2015 to December 2021 and 246 scenes of Level-2A data from October 2018 to December 2021 were extracted after cloud filtering with Google Earth Engine for the study of algal blooms in the Jiaozhou Bay region. Meteorological data The meteorological data used in this investigation were collected from the Xiaomai Island Observatory and consisted of hourly observations of air temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), wind speed, wind direction, and air pressure from July 2010 to July 2022. These data were collected by the National Ocean Data Observation Centre ( http://mds.nmdis.org.cn/ ). Monthly averages were calculated to investigate the meteorological factors that initiate harmful algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay. Water quality monitoring data This study utilized measurements of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP), chemical oxygen demand (COD), dissolved oxygen (DO), and petroleum pollutants for water quality monitoring. From 2014 to 2022, these measurements were obtained in the near-shore waters of Jiaozhou Bay. In addition, from 2014 to 2018, measurements of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and silicate were collected from four inlet rivers in the Jiaozhou Bay area, including the Licun River, Dagu River, Moshui River, and Haibo River. The information was gathered at the National Field Scientific Observation and Research Station( http://jzb.cern.ac.cn/ ) for Marine Ecosystems in Jiaozhou Bay, Shandong Province, and all the sampling points of the station have been fully marked in Fig. 1 a. Image processing methods Floating algae index (FAI) The Floating Algae Index (FAI) employs a threshold segmentation method that utilizes the red, near-infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands to extract areas of algal blooms in seawater. This method emphasizes waters affected by algal blooms by using the uplift of algal blooms in the NIR band and reduces the FAI’s sensitivity to different aerosol types by subtracting the baseline 18 . The reduced susceptibility of FAI to environmental interference and its enhanced advantages over other methods, such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), have led to its increased use in the global study of algal blooms 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 . $$\begin{aligned} {\text{FAI}} = & R_{{rc,NIR}} - R_{{rc,NIR^{\prime } }}^{\prime } \\ R_{{rc,NIR}}^{\prime } = & R_{{rc,{\text{ Red }}}} + \left( {R_{{rc,SWIR}} - R_{{rc,{\text{ Red }}}} } \right) \times \left( {\lambda _{{NIR}} - \lambda _{{{\text{ Red }}}} } \right)/\left( {\lambda _{{SWIR}} - \lambda _{{{\text{ Red }}}} } \right) \\ \end{aligned}$$ (1) where \(R_{{rc,NIR}}\) , \(R_{{rc,\text{Re} d}}\) and \(R_{{rc,SWIR}}\) are the reflectance in the NIR, Red and SWIR bands after Rayleigh correction, respectively. \(\lambda _{{{\text{ NIR }}}}\) , \(\lambda _{{{\text{Red}}}}\) and \(\lambda _{{{\text{SWIR}}}}\) are the central bands of the sensor’s corresponding bandwidth. Selection of the optimal threshold To accurately extract the area of algal colonies using FAI threshold segmentation, it is necessary to identify the optimal threshold that yields the most accurate results. However, it is not possible to manually determine the optimal threshold through point-by-point observation and experimentation on a single image. Similarly, manually determining the optimal threshold for all MODIS and Sentinel-2 images and then performing statistical analysis to identify the values would be a daunting task. The maximum gradient method introduced by Ma et al. 21 is an effective alternative to manually determining the optimal threshold. However, it should be noted that this method requires a substantial amount of human effort. In addition, it is essential to recognize that a large number of images without algal blooms will need to be analyzed and their optimal thresholds determined, which can be time-consuming and may affect the statistical regularity of the optimal thresholds for algal bloom outbreaks. This research differs from others in that it concentrates on continuously observing the extraction effect of various thresholds on an image of an algal outbreak (captured on 10 July 2021) in order to determine the optimal threshold as the starting point for analysis. Despite the possibility that the starting threshold does not entirely reflect the optimal extraction effect, it can still reflect the trend of algal bloom area change. The study then traversed all images that met the initial threshold in order to isolate the algal blooms region. By choosing the larger FAI area as the date of the algal bloom, a threshold for determining the image set was established. The study determined manually, with a minimum accuracy of 0.005, the optimal threshold value for each image in the set and analyzed the results. The most frequent threshold value was selected as the optimal threshold value, saving time and preventing the capture of images free of algal blooms. In the Jiaozhou Bay region, the optimal FAI extraction threshold was determined to be 0.05 for MODIS and 0.045 for Sentinel-2 using this method. Processing of MODIS satellite data In this study, we processed the MODIS satellite data using the Google Earth Engine cloud platform (GEE) ( https://code.earthengine.google.com/ ) 32 . After reprojecting the MOD09GA dataset from ’SR-ORG:6974’ to ’EPSG:4326’, we clipped the images to our study area and kept the resolution constant at 500 meters. In order to investigate algal bloom outbreaks in the region, we additionally removed clouds from each image. During processing, we filtered the data and selected only those with more than zero observations. Then, these particular data were declouded. For this research, we selected a band resolution of 500 meters, which may introduce some error when analyzing small areas such as Jiaozhou Bay. To prevent erroneous positives caused by the involvement of the ground in the calculation process, a special treatment was applied to the study area. Specifically, we selected only data within 1 kilometer of the coast. Ultimately, the algal bloom zone was extracted. Processing of Sentinel-2 satellite data The GEE platform provides Sentinel-2 images in Level 1C and Level 2A formats. The first is orthorectified and geometrically corrected but lacks atmospheric correction, whereas the second is ortho-corrected for bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (BOA). Consequently, Level 2A images provide more realistic reflectance data, more accurate color levels, greater brightness and contrast, and are generally more color sensitive. In the previous study, we found that atmospheric correction was predominantly responsible for the difference in quality. When extracting the area of algal blooms using the FAI threshold segmentation method, the area of Level 2A data was consistently greater than that of Level 1C data for bloom areas that exceeded a certain threshold. Figure 2 Comparison of FAI index extracted from Sentinel-2 2A and 1C at the same threshold The map was created by using Python 3.7( https://www.python.org/downloads/ ). Full size image In this study, two images were extracted using the 1C-Level and 2A-Level datasets from Sentinel-2 (Figure 2 ) on 10 July 2021, an algal bloom outbreak was observed, and analysis of the extracted area and color depth revealed that the FAI value for dateset 2A was greater than for dataset 1C. Consequently, when both were extracted above a particular threshold, the outbreak area of dataset 2A was greater than that of dataset 1C. On October 23, 2021, no algal bloom outbreak was detected. Nevertheless, it was discovered that dataset 2A was more sensitive due to its own atmospheric correction procedure and Sentinel-2’s high resolution. This increased the number of false-positive planktonic algae identifications 33 , 34 . In this study, the false-positive phenomenon occurs when non-algal bloom areas are extracted as algal blooms using satellite imagery. Due to factors such as the developed fisheries industry, human activity, and changes in sea level in the coastal waters of Jiaozhou Bay, shallow beaches and sediment often appear near the coast. These areas may be mistakenly extracted as algal blooms using the FAI method, resulting in false positives. In contrast, fewer false positives were extracted from the dataset 1C. Although the threshold can be adjusted to reduce false positives, this may result in algal bloom area loss, which may not be desirable 21 . This study proposes the Single Threshold Multi-stage Weakening (STMW) method (as shown in Figure 3 ) to reduce the occurrence of false positives while mitigating the loss of algal bloom area. The STMW method was developed to overcome the limitations of using either level 1C or level 2A data by combining the two. The 1C data can be used to identify the days of algal blooms outbreak, but the actual aera of algal blooms outbreak is calculated from the corresponding 2A data. This method extracts the area of the blooms from a copy of the level 2A data at its optimal threshold and utilizes the level 1C data to substantially reduce the number of false positives in the level 2A data. The STMW method utilizes the low sensitivity of the 1C data to eliminate the effect of false positives and precisely analyze the number of algal bloom outbreak days. Finally, it eliminates some outliers and reduces errors, thereby enhancing the detection accuracy of algal bloom areas. Figure 3 Flow chart for extracting the area of algal blooms using the GEE. Full size image Modeling the area of algal bloom Deep neural networks (DNNs) Predicting changes in the area of algal outbreaks remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of algal blooms and their unpredictable response to complex environmental conditions 35 . This study employs deep neural networks (DNNs), a type of deep learning technique, to analyze changes in the area of algal bloom outbreaks, focusing exclusively on the influence of meteorological factors. DNNs are generally accepted as effective in predicting time series data 36 . Figure 4 Structure diagram of deep neural network. Full size image This study selected the area of algal blooms measured using MODIS since 2010 and calculated the monthly average of this data. The relationship between this area data and three meteorological factors - wind speed, barometric pressure, and sea surface temperature (SST) - was analyzed separately (Figure 11 ). The results showed that the changes in algal bloom area exhibited a distinct annual variation pattern and had a strong correlation with these three factors. In this paper, we used a DNN neural network model (Figure 4 ) to predict the monthly mean algal bloom area in the study area, with wind speed, barometric pressure, and SST as independent variables and algal bloom area as the dependent variable. SARIMA model Changes in the time series of algal bloom areas show that these outbreaks exhibit strong seasonality, clear cyclical characteristics, and growth trends. However, the previous deep neural network (DNN) model had limitations in accurately predicting algal outbreaks under the influence of multiple factors due to variability among indicators. Furthermore, because the input layer only used meteorological factors, the model lacked data interpretability. To improve prediction accuracy, we used seasonal decomposition and the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to control the objective pattern of algal development. The SRIMA model is an extension of the ARIMA model, which was originally proposed by Box and Jenkins in 1970 for time series analysis 37 . The SRIMA model incorporates seasonal components by including seasonal differencing to capture seasonal variations in the time series data. By exclusively combining the 22-year extraction results of the MODIS dataset, we analyzed and predicted the algal bloom area in time series from an alternative perspective. The MODIS extraction results revealed an upward trend in algal bloom outbreaks, with significantly stronger outbreaks occurring in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. Despite changes over time, the seasonal fluctuations of the algal bloom area did not differ significantly between the previous and current observation periods. This study removes the influence of seasonality from the time series to investigate the seasonality of algal outbreaks and other masked characteristics. To accomplish this, we used an additive seasonal decomposition model to divide the algal bloom outbreak time series into four components: irregular changes, seasonally adjusted series, seasonal adjustment factors, and trend cyclic components. These elements enable us to quantify the effects of different factors on algal bloom outbreaks. After testing, we used SARIMA (0, 0, 1) (0, 1, 1) to analyze and predict based on the above patterns. $$\left( {1 - L^{{12}} } \right)y_{t} = \alpha _{0} + (1 + \theta L)\left( {1 + \Theta L^{{12}} } \right)\varepsilon _{t}$$ (2) where L is the lag operator and \(\varepsilon _{t}\) is a white noise series with variance \(\sigma ^{2}\) . \(\Theta\) is the seasonal moving average term coefficient, \(\theta\) is the non-seasonal moving average term coefficient and \(\alpha _{0}\) is the intercept term.

First row is the Sentinel-2 true color image, Second and third row are the FAI calculated fromSentinel-2 and MODIS at the same day(21th July 2019, 20th June 2021, 10th July 2021, 25th June 2022).The map was created by using Python 3.7 ( https://www.python.org/downloads/ ). Full size image Multiple satellites were utilized to track the algal bloom in Jiaozhou Bay. For comparison, we selected three images from each of four days: the Sentinel-2 true-color image, the Sentinel-2 FAI index image, and the MODIS FAI index image.These images were compared to evaluate their ability to extract information about the algal bloom region (Figure 5 ).Both MODIS and Sentinel-2 images can detect algal bloom outbreaks, but they differ significantly in spatial resolution. MODIS has a lower spatial resolution, resulting in coarser monitoring results for cyanobacterial outbreak areas. However, its high temporal resolution allows for observation of the entire outbreak process. Using the extracted area from the MODIS dataset, we generated a 22-year time series of variations in the algal bloom area (Figures 6 and 7 ). To better analyze the trend of changes in the algal bloom area in Jiaozhou Bay, we used a moving average (MA) window method (Figure 6 (b)). The MA window is a commonly used technique to smooth out the fluctuations in a time series and identify trends or patterns. The moving average is calculated by taking the average of a fixed number of consecutive data points in the time series. This fixed number is known as the window size. In this study, we set the window size as seven days. According to our findings, the area of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay remained relatively stable prior to 2017. However, over the next five years, there was a general upward trend in the overall algal bloom area in Jiaozhou Bay. Further examination of the annual changes in algal blooms reveals that algal bloom outbreaks are primarily concentrated in the summer, particularly from May to September. This finding is consistent with previous research on chlorophyll a concentrations in Jiaozhou Bay, which discovered that the peak concentration of chlorophyll a occurs during the summer months 12 .

Full size image We compared the algal bloom area data extracted from Sentinel-2 and MODIS and examined the differences and effects of extraction between the two satellites (Figure 8 ). Due to the discontinuity of the Sentinel-2 time series during the extraction process, we selected corresponding MODIS values for comparison based on the availability of Sentinel-2 data. Both MODIS and Sentinel-2 successfully captured peak periods of high algal outbreaks, demonstrating their effectiveness in monitoring algal blooms. However, we observed some false positives in MODIS data during non-outbreak periods. Figure 8 Comparison of FAI index calculated by MODIS and Sentinel-2.

Full size image Despite these differences, there was strong consistency in the trends between the two datasets. Additionally, the value of the algal bloom area in the MODIS data was higher than that of Sentinel-2, which can be attributed to differences in resolution and sensors used by the two satellites. Figure 9 shows the frequency of spatial distribution characteristics of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay. Our findings indicate that the coastal area of Jiaozhou Bay experienced a more severe outbreak of algal blooms, with the area of algal blooms decreasing from the coast to the bay’s inner sea. The outbreak was primarily concentrated in the bay’s coastal, central, and estuary regions. We analyzed the data on total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and silicate content in the Li River, Da Gu River, Mo Shui River, and Hai He River, which flow into the estuary of Jiaozhou Bay (see Figure 1 ) and were obtained from the Jiaozhou Bay National Marine Ecosystem Research Station. In addition, nutrient data were collected at sampling points. The results revealed that the N, P, and silicate content at the river mouths (coastal areas of Jiaozhou Bay) were significantly higher than those in the interior of the bay. The occurrence of algal blooms is closely related to nutrient levels, and the large amounts of nutrients brought by rivers promote the development of nearshore phytoplankton in Jiaozhou Bay, leading to frequent algal blooms in this region. From 2000 to 2016, the outbreak of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay’s inner sea was not severe. However, since 2017, the outbreak of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay’s inland area has become more severe and did not abate until 2021. Reduction of false positives After determining the optimal threshold for the Sentinel-2 dataset, we found that the optimal threshold for dataset 1C was larger than that for dataset 2A, and either 1C or 2A could extract the precise area. However, when both 1C and 2A used their optimal thresholds, their results were affected by false positives. As our analysis shows, applying the threshold for dataset 2A to 1C significantly reduced the number of false positives and the resulting algal bloom area. We determined that the optimal threshold for detecting the presence of a harmful algal bloom using Sentinel-2 satellite level 2A data was 0.045. To compare and analyze the differences in false positives between level-1C and level-2A satellite extractions, we selected the months of January, February, March, October, November, and December, which rarely experience algal bloom outbreaks. Our goal was to extract data from datasets 1C and 2A with a threshold greater than 0.045 and then compare false positive rates during months when algal bloom outbreaks are uncommon. The maximum area extracted from the level 2A data was only 31 \(km^2\) , and the mean value was 5.6 \(km^2\) . These results significantly affected our analysis of the algal outbreak area. Therefore, we chose to focus on the 1C data, which had a mean area value that was 93% less than that of dataset 2A. This significantly reduced the impact of false positives and made it easier to differentiate between real algal bloom outbreaks and false positives. To further enhance our analysis, we decided to focus on a small rectangular area within Jiaozhou Bay. This allowed us to avoid confusion caused by false-positive results along the coast. In this small area, our analysis of level 1C data revealed a mean value that was 37.8% lower than level 2A data. This helped us discount false positives and obtain a more precise observation of the extent of the algal bloom outbreak. Figure 10 Comparison of the loss of algal bloom area and false-positive reduction. ( a ) shows the histogram of false positive reduction, ( b ) shows the histogram of the loss of algal blooms area. Full size image In order to reduce false positives, The optimal level 2A threshold was utilized to extract level 1C data, and statistical analysis was performed (As shown in Figure 10 ). While the number of false positives decreased substantially, the area of algal blooms also decreased noticeably. Due to the presence of false positives, it was difficult to utilize level 2A data to evaluate the algal blooms. In contrast, the level 1C data eliminated the majority of false positives, making it simpler to observe the trend of the outbreak of algal blooms. Correlation analysis Meteorological factors Using MODIS data, we calculated monthly averages of algal bloom area and analyzed meteorological data to determine the factors contributing to algal bloom outbreaks in Jiaozhou Bay. We examined the available data to ascertain the relationship between these variables and algal bloom area. Our results show a weak negative correlation between wind speed and algal bloom area, consistent with previous findings (Figure 11 ) 38 . Additionally, our analysis reveals a significant inverse relationship between air pressure and algal bloom outbreaks, as well as a significant positive relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and algal bloom outbreaks. We calculated the correlation coefficients between environmental factors and algal bloom outbreaks (Table 1 ). These findings suggest that algal bloom outbreaks are more likely to occur when wind speed is low, air pressure is low, and temperature is high. With these environmental factors in mind, appropriate measures can be taken to control algal bloom outbreaks. Our analysis of the spatial distribution of algal bloom area in Jiaozhou Bay indicates that outbreaks are more severe in the bay’s coastal regions. The area of algal blooms decreases progressively from the coast to the inner waters, with the majority of outbreak areas concentrated on the coast, middle, and estuary. From 2000 to 2016, algal bloom outbreaks in Jiaozhou Bay’s inner waters were not severe. However, beginning in 2017, outbreaks in the bay’s inner waters grew steadily worse until 2021, when they were ultimately mitigated. Figure 11 Analysis of the relationship between environmental factors and algal bloom outbreaks. ( a , d , g ) show scatter plots between the algal bloom area and air pressure(countdown), sea surface temperature(SST), and wind speed (countdown), respectively, and ( b , e , h ) show monthly average series of the algal bloom area and the air pressure, SST and the wind speed for November 2010–2022, and d ( c , f , i ) show the results of taking the average of the corresponding monthly values from 2010 to 2022. Full size image Table 1 Correlation coefficients between the algal bloom area and three meteorological factors: air pressure, wind speed and SST. Full size table Seawater quality factors In this study, seawater quality data collected in Jiaozhou Bay between 2014 and 2022 was used to investigate the relationship between water quality and algal bloom outbreaks in conjunction with algal bloom area extracted from MODIS and Sentinel-2 data. MODIS satellite images within 5 to 7 days before and after water quality sampling were chosen for extracting algal bloom areas, and the extracted areas were then averaged for comparison analysis. As Fig. 12 shows, there was a clear correlation between algal bloom area and petroleum pollutants, which could be attributed to the fact that petroleum hydrocarbons nourish algal organisms. In contrast, there was an inverse relationship between algal bloom area and dissolved oxygen (DO), which may result from oxygen depletion in the water column caused by algal growth. The previously described approach was not suitable for Sentinel-2 satellite data due to its long sampling interval. Consequently, monthly and annual averages of algal bloom area derived from Sentinel-2 satellite data were used to analyze the correlation with corresponding water quality data. The results (Fig. 13 ) indicate a certain correlation between algal bloom area, DIN/DIP, and COD concentrations. The results of their regression analysis are presented in Table 2 . Figure 12 Time series of petroleum pollutants, DO and algal bloom area extracted from MODIS. Full size image Figure 13 Yearly time series of DIN/DIP, COD and algal bloom area extracted from Sentinel-2 data. Full size image Predicted results Figure 14 a The results from the DNN neural network model closely agree with the actual values, indicating the model’s robustness and consistent trend. Due to the unavailability of meteorological data during certain periods, some monthly area data could not be used in the forecast. However, since the prediction is based solely on meteorological factors, it is impossible to accurately foresee abrupt increases in algal bloom area due to other factors. By integrating seawater quality composition, the model’s accuracy can be improved. After optimizing the model’s hyperparameters, its performance was assessed and summarized (Table 3 ). The final test set has an \(R^2\) value of 0.65, indicating acceptable prediction accuracy. Table 2 Regression results. Full size table Figure 14 Prediction of algal bloom area by DNN ( a ) and SARIMA ( b ). Full size image Table 3 DNN model evaluation. Full size table According to the predicted results of the SARIMA model (Fig. 14 b), algal bloom outbreaks are highly seasonal. This is due to cyclical temperature changes accompanying the seasons and the disruption of the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio balance in the water column during the summer fishing season peak. Since algal blooms have a strong correlation with temperature, nitrogen, and phosphorus ratios, this leads to seasonal outbreaks. An upward trend in algal bloom outbreaks is observed, with substantially stronger outbreaks in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. We used an additive model of seasonal decomposition to quantify the impact of seasonal factors on algal bloom outbreaks. Table 4 Seasonal factors for the variation of algal bloom area. Full size table According to the results shown in Table 4 , seasonal factors are positive for May to October and negative for January to April and November to December. This suggests that algal bloom outbreaks are more severe in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth. The most intense outbreak occurred in September, with an area larger than the annual average of 0.398 \(km^2\) , while the smallest occurred in March, with an area smaller than the annual average of 0.298 \(km^2\) . We removed outliers from two decades of historical algal bloom outbreak data before iteratively estimating parameters to obtain an iterative expression for the time series ( 2 ). All significance levels are less than 5% based on the estimation results (Table 5 ), indicating a good fit. $$\begin{aligned} y_{t}=0.015+y_{t-12}+\varepsilon _{t}-0.217 \varepsilon _{t-1}+0.689 \varepsilon _{t-12}-0.150 \varepsilon _{t-13} \end{aligned}$$ (3) where \(y_t\) and \(y_{t-12}\) are the actual observed area of algal blooms in periods t and t-12, respectively. \(\varepsilon _{i}\) is the white noise series with variance \(\sigma ^{2}\) , which represents the difference between the predicted value and the observed value in period i. In this equation i takes t,t-1,t-12,t-13. Table 5 Evaluation of estimation results. Full size table Discussion For comparative analysis, we obtained MODIS datasets corresponding to the Sentinel-2 data. To reduce the impact of false positives during extraction, we excluded data with minor values based on predetermined thresholds and retained only data collected during algal bloom periods. The data was then filtered to yield 35 corresponding data points. After analyzing the correlation between the two datasets using scatter plots, we calculated an \(R^2\) value of 0.67 (Fig. 15 ). Due to the 500-meter resolution of the MODIS satellite’s observational pixel, the vast majority of algal blooms could be included, even at the boundary. However, despite our best efforts to modify the threshold value, non-algal material may still be included, resulting in a high algal bloom area. Although the Red(620–670nm) and Green(545–565nm) bands of MODIS have some degree of accuracy, NIR(841–876nm) and Blue(459–479nm) bands have a high degree of uncertainty and may not be suitable for monitoring algal blooms at a large scale 39 . The effectiveness of Sentinel-2 data with a 10-meter resolution in extracting algal bloom areas is unstable due to the influence of clouds and the sampling period. Using the FAI threshold extraction method, the algal bloom region can be extracted from certain images with relatively high precision. However, its long resampling interval makes it unsuitable for analyzing changes in algal bloom area. Additionally, its higher resolution makes it susceptible to the influence of coastal infrastructure on ocean color, resulting in erroneous estimates of the extracted algal bloom area 40 . Figure 15 Comparison of algal bloom area derived from MODIS and Sentinel-2 data. Full size image In this study, algal bloom data extracted from the MODIS dataset were analyzed using the average of observed non-zero data within a range of 5 to 7 days before and after the water quality observation time. This approach was necessary due to the temporal dispersion of water quality measurements, which were conducted three to four times per year. Using monthly averages of algal bloom area and water quality data may introduce errors due to their temporal inconsistency. Although it would be ideal to match the precise date of water quality data collection with the one-day resampling nature of the MODIS satellite, de-cloud processing makes it impossible to precisely align the satellite observation period with water quality monitoring. Therefore, the average value of observed water bloom area within 5–7 days of water quality monitoring was used as corresponding data. The 5-day resampling time for Sentinel-2 satellite data highlights discontinuity following de-clouding processing, necessitating the use of monthly averaged water bloom area values for analysis, which may introduce some error. Additionally, collecting water quality data before and after algal blooms for comparative analysis would enable more precise investigation of their causes. The inconsistency between satellite sampling and water quality monitoring can result in a lack of correlation and analytical error. Algal blooms result from a combination of physiological mechanisms and environmental factors, including water temperature, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and water quality. Nitrogen and phosphorus have been identified as significant contributors to algal bloom outbreaks 41 . Research indicates that silicate and phosphorus are the primary limiting factors for planktonic algae expansion in the Jiaozhou Bay region 42 . The majority of Jiaozhou Bay’s total DIN and DIP discharges come from land-based sources, accounting for 93% and 98%, respectively 43 , 44 . Land-based pollutants enter Jiaozhou Bay via inlet rivers, most of which are currently flow-interrupted. Four tributary rivers, the Licun, Dagu, Ink, and Haibe Rivers, were analyzed in 2014 and 2015 when they had water flow. Nutrient ratios were determined by analyzing total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and silicate content at the rivers’ entrances to Jiaozhou Bay. The N/P ratio was 25.8±17.1, the N/Si ratio was 3.35±1.35, and the Si/P ratio was 8.9±6.4. N/Si values tend to remain stable in Jiaozhou Bay, while the N/P ratio fluctuates the most. Furthermore, P has a greater impact on planktonic algae growth than Si in Jiaozhou Bay. Some studies have indicated that Jiaozhou Bay has become a “phosphorus-limited” environment , consistent with the findings of this study 45 , 46 . Researchers investigating 17 lakes worldwide have shown that lower N/P ratios promote algal growth 47 , but some studies have also shown that algal outbreaks occur when the N/P ratio is high, suggesting that a low N/P ratio is a result rather than a cause of the outbreak 48 . It should be noted that the N and P requirements of algae vary depending on the environment and species. This study’s analysis concluded that there is a positive correlation between the N/P ratio and algal bloom area. The results also demonstrated that the N/Si value tends to be stable, indicating that algae in Jiaozhou Bay are highly sensitive to changes in phosphorus levels. The highest observed DIN/DIP value reached 387, and the N/P ratio at several observation sites exceeded 100 in summer, surpassing the Redfield ratio 49 . However, the ratio decreased in winter. For example, during a severe algal bloom in 2019, the average N/P ratio in August was 62, while in October it was 14.9, approaching the Redfield ratio. These findings suggest that sudden increases in phosphorus content due to external factors could trigger large algal bloom outbreaks, leading to a decrease in the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio. In this study, a positive correlation was observed between algal bloom area and COD content. This can be attributed to the release of organic matter by algae during their growth cycle, particularly during normal growth and metabolism stages when extracellular organic matter (EOM) is released into the water column, leading to a significant increase in COD content. Other research 50 confirms this idea, indicating that an abrupt spike in COD concentration results from an algal bloom epidemic . However, due to the influence of the long resampling interval for Sentinel-2 observation and nutrient concentration measurement, monthly average data was used for analysis, and thus the lag in COD content was not very clear. Nevertheless, the study still demonstrates a correlation between COD and algal bloom area. Conclusion Examining the long-term time series of algal blooms is essential to comprehend the ecological changes in Jiaozhou Bay and mitigate the risks posed by algal blooms. Using MODIS and Sentinel-2 satellite datasets, this study observed the spatial and temporal variations of algal blooms from 2000 to 2022, analyzed the factors driving the outbreak of algal blooms in the Jiaozhou Bay region, and modeled the changes of algal blooms in the region using deep learning and predicted that with SARIMA models. The study found that the incidence of algal blooms in Jiaozhou Bay was comparatively stable from 2000 to 2016, but has increased since 2017, especially during the summer, indicating a more pronounced seasonality. The algal bloom outbreak areas were primarily concentrated along the coast, in the midsection, and at the estuary of the bay. Meteorological factors such as sea surface temperature, wind speed, and air pressure, as well as water quality factors such as dissolved oxygen, nitrogen to phosphorus ratio, chemical oxygen demand, and petroleum pollutants, were identified as important drivers of algal bloom outbreaks. In addition, the study revealed that the algal bloom area computed using MODIS satellites was generally larger than those calculated using Sentinel-2 satellites, which was a result of the sensor characteristics of the satellites. Finally, time series regression based on deep learning and predictions based on SARIMA models were developed to reproduce and forecast variations in algal bloom area at a monthly scale. In conclusion, this study provides critical data support for the study of algae blooms in the Jiaozhou Bay region, offers reference advice to governmental departments for emergency measures to manage algal blooms in the area, and offers valuable insights for future research on algal bloom outbreaks in bays around the world. Data availability The water quality monitoring datasets of Jiaozhou Bay used during the current study are not publicly available due to the provision of the data provider (Jiaozhou Bay Marine Ecosystem Research Station, Chinese Ecosystem Research Network), but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

With warm temperatures and a wet spring these past weeks, the City of Boulder reminds community members to be cautious around city lakes and ponds where algae blooms may be present. At elevated levels, some algae may produce toxins that are harmful to people and pets. Please remember to avoid contact with the water where algae are observed. Algae blooms naturally occur in aquatic ecosystems and can appear rapidly during hot weather, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Blooms also tend to appear in slow-moving water bodies, such as lakes and ponds. Some algae blooms can contain cyanobacteria – often referred to as blue-green algae. While the vast majority of algae often seen in ponds and lakes during summer months are not toxic, cyanobacteria can produce toxins that can be harmful to humans and dogs. Warmer temperatures, stagnant water, and nitrogen and phosphorus (nutrient) loading from fertilized lawns and other sources facilitate algae and cyanobacteria growth. Cyanobacteria blooms may look like: Thick pea soup Spilled bluish-green paint on the water's surface A thick mat of foam along the shoreline In general, the long, stringy, bright green strands that appear either slimy or cottony, or are mustard yellow in color, are not the potentially harmful type of algae. The city encourages our community to follow all posted rules and regulations when recreating near water in Boulder. At lakes and ponds where dogs are allowed to enter the water, practice caution if algae are present. Anglers should also exercise caution and follow state recommendations to clean any caught fish thoroughly and to discard guts appropriately. The city does not test for cyanobacteria at lakes and ponds because the production of cyanotoxins can be highly variable – with harmful toxins detectable at one time but not detectable hours later. For this reason, the city recommends caution whenever any algae are present.

They were the ancestors of many modern-day inhabitants, including David Myerholtz, a farmer who grows corn, soybeans and wheat by the south shore of Lake Erie, near Toledo. When his ancestors arrived at the region, they found a large, uninhabitable swamp. They wanted to farm the land, and so work had to be done on cleaning and draining it first. ‘They had a lot of experience on how to drain so they found a way to just drain the land right to Lake Erie,’ Myerholtz says. So they built a drainage channel to take water to the lake. ‘Our water can get to the lake very fast because of the elevation we’re at, and the great management of streams and creeks that we’ve done.’ Yet what started with good intentions has now become a concern for local communities in the region. And that is because water flowing from farmland carries an overload of nutrients which then promote an abnormal multiplication of algae in the lake, in a phenomenon known as algal blooms. Nuisance nutrients Algal blooms happen when algae grow out of control in a water body, creating massive clumps of what looks like a green sludge in the water’s surface. They’re caused by various factors, but an increase in nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen tends to be a key reason. Some of these algae produce toxins which can then cause harm to people who swim in or even drink the water, as well as to fauna and flora. The large clumps of algae consume all of the oxygen in the water and block sunlight too, meaning most aquatic beings around a bloom are at risk. Lake Erie is no stranger to algal blooms. In the 1960s, sewage pollution was causing big blooms and policymakers had to step in. With the 1972 Clean Water Act – legislation regulating discharges of pollutants into US waters and quality standards for surface waters – the lake got healthier. However, in the past two decades, algal blooms have been returning, and with that, returned public concern. ‘The period 2005 to 2010 is when these algal blooms became a little bit more publicly known,’ Myerholtz says. The year of 2014 might linger in locals’ minds the most. By then, the city of Toledo had to cut its water supply due to the presence of dangerous toxins in the lake’s waters, all coming in from a bloom. Algal blooms are happening more often – and getting bigger However, looking at the size and intensity of algal blooms, this wasn’t really a notable year. ‘In the grand scheme of things, 2014 was not this massive bloom, but it just so happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. It just happened to be concentrated right around the water intake for the city of Toledo,’ explains Anna Michalak, director of the department of global ecology at the Carnegie Institution for Science in the US. Michalak studies how climate change affects freshwater lakes and part of her work involves studying bloom trends. She mentions that blooms in large lakes worldwide have been becoming more severe in the past decades. The overall work of understanding trends in algal blooms is difficult. On the one hand, there are many factors to consider, and nutrients are just part of the puzzle. Weather conditions, water currents and different algae species can all affect how and when a bloom forms. On the other hand, because technology is improving, it’s difficult to understand whether algal blooms are occurring more often or if we’re just seeing them more often. Yet various studies seem to show algal blooms are becoming a bigger problem. In a study published earlier this year, researchers used satellite information to track coastal algal blooms all over the globe between 2003 and 2020. They saw blooms were happening more often and getting bigger and attributed it to variations in ocean temperatures and circulation patterns – as well as climate change. Climate change to blame Like many creatures, algae thrive in warmer environments. And so, with bodies of water warming up faster than expected due to changing temperatures, blooms are expected to be bigger. Precipitation is changing in a way that makes matters worse for Lake Erie too. Michalak explains that while the total amount of rainfall isn’t changing drastically in the region, change in precipitation patterns impacts bloom formation. By looking at past climate information in the Great Lakes area as well as climate projections, her team has concluded that two main changes are happening: more rainfall is coming in the spring and more of that rainfall happens in intense precipitation events. ‘If you have these very intense rainfalls, they’re going to lead to a much more [fertiliser] runoff than if you have a sort of gentler rainfall over a longer period of time,’ she adds. ‘This is primarily a phosphorus story. But I would say it’s also a climate story.’ And so farmers like Myerholtz need to pay extra attention on how they apply fertiliser, as well as when they do so. At his farm, he’s been using a machine that injects fertiliser to soils and he’s only doing that when heavy precipitation isn’t expected. ‘We’re injecting it so that we are trying to secure it in place in a way that it’s not at the surface; it’s less vulnerable to erosion and escape from your farm,’ he adds. But simply reducing nutrient runoff isn’t what’s going to prevent algal blooms, at least in the short-term. Michalak’s research shows there’s some internal recycling of phosphorus within the lake itself. This means phosphate that’s been in the lake for years is still being used by algae to grow today. Consequently, as farmers implement better management strategies, it’ll take several years – up to a decade – before the full benefits of those practices become visible. ‘It’s important that people like politicians understand that it’s not going to be the sort of magic silver bullet; that we do something differently one year, and magically the next year, everything is better,’ Michalak concludes. Under the waters When Angélica Vázquez-Ortega moved to Toledo from Puerto Rico she was saddened to see Lake Erie threatened by its blooms. ‘I don’t want to take my kids canoeing, or even rent a boat or a jet ski. It’s nasty, it’s green, it’s smelly […] It’s an amazing resource that we have, but we cannot pretty much use it for recreational purposes anymore,’ she says. Vázquez-Ortega joined Bowling Green State University as an associate professor, and as an environmental scientist is looking for ways of working on the local landscapes. After learning more about the local land management strategies, she saw potential to recover Lake Erie’s nutritional balance by looking under its murky waters, right into the soil in its bed. The Great Lakes are filled with harbours and channels where boats circulate all year for commercial and recreational purposes. To maintain these channels and harbours at safe depths, the US Corps of Engineers dredges the lakes periodically, meaning it removes soil from the bottom of the lakes. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, around 4 million cubic yards (3 million cubic metres) of sediments are dredged every year from Great Lakes’ harbours – the equivalent of 400,000 truck loads of soil. Because storing all of this sediment is an expensive endeavour, various researchers are looking for ways of repurposing dredged material to do something useful with it. And this is where Vázquez-Ortega’s work comes into play. Source: © Shikshya Gautam, Biological Sciences Department at Bowling Green State University Corn plants grew better when scientists added sediments dredged from a lake to their soil Her research focuses on using dredged materials as natural fertilisers to try to convince farmers they don’t need to use synthetic ones. So far, she and her team have used dredged materials as fertilisers in small-scale experiments inside greenhouses, growing plants in farm soil that has been mixed with dredged sediment. Her team made different blends, mixing soil with different amounts of dredged materials to study how dredged sediment impacts plant growth. And the results have been positive. ‘In the greenhouse experiments, the result has been consistent. The higher the dredge amount that I’m mixing with the soil, the higher the above biomass; the yield increases,’ she adds. While the research is promising, two major steps are still needed. Firstly, her team will need to understand if this would be a robust replacement for synthetic fertilisers. Secondly, it’s essential that they understand if using dredged materials would actually help reduce nutrient runoff into the lake. Vázquez-Ortega has rented a farm and will soon grow crops to address both questions. She’ll have two areas: in one she’ll manage the land as a regular farmer would and use regular fertilisers, and in the other she’ll only apply fertilisers based on dredged materials. She hopes land where she has applied dredged fertiliser will have less nutrient runoff and thus be a better option to prevent nutrient overload in nearby lakes, such as Lake Erie. The case of ponds Almost 1500 km away from Lake Erie, in the varied landscape of Oklahoma, other teams are battling algal blooms too, though in smaller size. Oklahoma is dotted with hundreds of lakes and ponds, and all serve multiple communities around the state. People use them for boating, swimming, sightseeing and much more, but what worries Nick Materer, a professor of chemistry at Oklahoma State University is how these ponds are slowly becoming less useful to farmers. ‘We have a lot of livestock, maybe more livestock than people. And we have these agricultural runoffs, and they [nutrients] get in these ponds and then the ponds have algal blooms and the cattle can’t drink it,’ he explains. ‘This has a real impact here, on the agricultural community.’ Materer joined other chemists in designing an absorbent substance that farmers could easily toss into ponds to absorb the excess nutrients. Yet, Materer then got intrigued by the potential of re-using the nutrients that had been captured. ‘You have a valuable material stuck in the sorbent, so what do you do with that? You don’t want to throw it away,’ he adds. You should be removing the excess nutrients but also making a new product And so the scientists sought to make a material that farmers could use to capture nutrients and then apply them on the soil as fertiliser. The challenge then became to create a material that’s good at absorbing the nutrients, but not too good that it doesn’t release them afterwards. They came up with a sorbent made of aluminium and magnesium with high capacity for absorbing phosphate and nitrate, two important nutrients. The result looks like a small white bead which the team has tested in real life scenarios. In an eight-week study, researchers grew lilies in a lab, and fertilised plants with the nutrient-enriched beads. The plants that had received nutrients from the beads grew healthily and flowered well, while the plants that had not received any fertiliser didn’t grow as much and did not flower. The beads already have a commercial name, and Materer’s team is working on making them accessible to farmers. To him, the main goal would be that farmers include the beads in their overall management strategy: farmers would fill up the beads in the summer – when blooms tend to be more intense – and then store the nutrient-heavy beads up until the fall or spring, when they could use them in various crops. Like Vázquez-Ortega’s approach, the overall goal is to reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and thus steadily reduce the input of new nutrients in the land, and consequently, the lakes and ponds. ‘We think that this is really where you should be going; you should be removing these materials [excess nutrients] but also making a new product, so you don’t generate more waste,’ Materer says. ‘I like the idea of having chemistry that kind of gets into that sort of a lifecycle where it doesn’t go to landfill.’ While Materer’s chemistry acts in smaller ponds like the ones in Oklahoma, a team of scientists in China has bigger ambitions. Geoengineering done sustainably? Lake Tai, in the Jiangsu province, China, is a testament to anthropological change. The Chinese lake is 10 times smaller than Lake Erie, but over 20 million people live on its shores in the cities of Suzhou and Wuxi, with Shanghai nearby. Wastewater, agricultural runoff and pollution as well as unprecedented population growth has changed the lake significantly in the past two decades, and algal blooms are now more common. ‘When the industrial revolution started, there were so many industries, and they were putting their wastewater directly into the rivers. They have serious problems with these issues,’ explains Jafar Ali, a postdoctoral researcher in Jilin University in Changchun, China. Ali is originally from Pakistan, but he moved to China seven years ago to do a PhD in environmental science. He came to the country in a time when efforts had been laid out by the Chinese Government to recover water quality in Lake Tai. He joined the work of Gang Pan, now professor of environmental sustainability at York St John University in the UK, who is known in the field for creating a new way of removing algal blooms from lakes with a geoengineering approach. Geoengineering is concerning to many. It involves interfering with Earth’s natural systems in a way that can become irreversible, so some experts believe it’s a risky method to solve environmental problems. Pan’s work is still not quite at the global scale, though. While his goal is to recover large bodies of water, his technology hasn’t cleaned complete lakes yet, but rather small pools filled with water from polluted lakes, including Lake Tai. Over the last few decades, his research team has varied, but Ali worked with him on developing and testing a series of modified local soil (MLS) materials that can be used to remove algal blooms from a lake. ‘You can simply think of MLS as soil particles combined with some natural organic compound which has some affinity towards the algal cells,’ Ali explains. The MLS particles are sprayed into the water and bind to microalgae, flocculating them into clumps that can then be removed from the lake’s water and locked in the bottom by a capping layer. The buried algal cells are degraded or collected and used as fertiliser. In a lab experiment in 2015 , researchers led by Pan showed that these MLS materials effectively cleared up more than 90% of algal cells and microcystins – a class of toxins produced by certain freshwater cyanobacteria – from water collected in Lake Tai. After these positive results, the team thought of taking it a step further. The case of oxygen Removing algae and nutrients from the equation is crucial to better manage algal blooms, but there’s more to these phenomena. Oxygen, for example, drops to deadly levels during blooms because algae take up the oxygen available in the water. And so, Ali joined Pan’s work on killing two birds with one stone: tackling the overload of algae while oxygenating unhealthy lakes. In theory, the job is simple. Scientists incorporate bubbles of oxygen into the MLS materials which are then added to the body of water. The organic compound binds to algae while the oxygen is released into the water. Normally, the oxygen bubble would float to the surface pretty quickly and not diffuse much oxygen, but because it is attached to the MLS particle, it slowly sinks, giving enough time for the oxygen to be diffused in the water. Source: Provided by Gang Pan Modified local soil can be sprayed into lake water to remove algae and reoxygenate the water Researchers tested this approach in pools with Lake Tai’s water . They sprayed a suspension of the MLS–oxygen particles over them, except for one pool that would serve as a control. The result is striking to look at. 20 days after spraying the solution, the treated pools’ water was cleaner and no longer green with algae. Besides the visual impact, the team collected water samples from the pools and saw that treated ponds had lower concentrations of nutrients and higher levels of dissolved oxygen. Thus, the materials seem to create a healthier habitat to local fauna and flora while getting rid of blooms. MLS has been commercialised and used in many engineering projects all around China, but never in a complete body of water. And so the question remains: could this technology clean and oxygenate a lake as big as Lake Erie? According to Pan, the road to complete lakes seems to be a long one. He told Chemistry World that to tackle an entire lake, one needs decision makers to set up ‘mega engineering projects.’ Those take time and money, of course, so it might take a while to see a lake as big as Erie completely cleaned with MLS. Tough conversations Despite coming from diverse backgrounds, Vázquez-Ortega, Materer and Pan’s solutions have one common hurdle: none of their research occurs in a vacuum. Pan has dealt with policymakers, while Vázquez-Ortega and Materer have dealt with farmers. And while farmers like Myerholtz are used to working with scientists, not all are happy to see researchers using their farm. There’s a big social aspect to this ‘It’s been a little hard to get some partners,’ Materer says. He just received funding from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to test his absorbing beads in real-life ponds in Oklahoma, but finding landowners willing to host him has been challenging. ‘As soon as you say EPA, they freak out: “Is the federal government going to come and shut down my farm?”’ he says. ‘There’s a big social aspect to this.’ Myerholtz explained that farmers’ needs must be understood. He cares about Lake Erie’s health and voluntarily participates in multiple grants and research projects to help recovering it. But he also wants people to understand that he needs fertilisers to grow crops and that he’s capable of using them responsibly. ‘I’m trying to voice the fact that we can achieve a healthier lake without a rash reduction in the use of [phosphate],’ he adds. Vázquez-Ortega believes the path forward is by connecting everyone’s expertise, from farmers, to policymakers, chemists and environmental agencies. And when people with different backgrounds need to work together, someone has to adapt. ‘I’m a city person. I don’t know anything about my way around a farm, but as soon as I get my boots out, I think they [farmers] can really understand me,’ Materer says.

The algae bloom led to the closure of parts of a marina and health warnings in neighboring counties. Swirls and tendrils of blue-green algae can be seen in this image, acquired on June 12, 2023, by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 . Around this time, a NOAA analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite data indicated that algae blooms covered about 380 square miles of the lake. That equates to more than half the area of the lake. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are single-celled organisms that rely on photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. The bacteria grow swiftly when nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen are abundant in still water. The bloom pictured here may contain blue-green algae, as well as other types of phytoplankton; only a surface sample can confirm the exact composition of a bloom. Some cyanobacteria produce microcystin —a potent toxin that can irritate the skin and cause liver and kidney damage. Microcystin was found in water samples taken from the lake on June 17 (five days after the image was acquired), including near the floodgate and canal used to release water into the St. Lucie Estuary on Florida’s southeastern coast. Excess lake water is typically released into the estuary and to farmlands to the south. But in mid-June, amid high lake levels, water managers prevented discharge because of the presence of harmful algae, according to the Miami Herald . The Florida Department of Health in Lee , Martin , and Palm Beach counties issued public health warnings in late June and early July, cautioning residents not to swim or boat in the lake due to the presence of harmful algal toxins. The harmful bloom grew to cover 420 square miles on July 4, and spanned 440 square miles by July 11. NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey .

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued a report finding hundreds of harmful algal blooms across the U.S. sickened people and killed animals — a problem that is likely to get worse. Harmful algal blooms , otherwise identified as HABs, stem from the ""rapid growth of algae or cyanobacteria"" in water. Some of the algae in these blooms produce toxins that can cause illnesses in both humans and animals, impacting health primarily through water exposure, but also through the air. Here's what to know. Where are the harmful algal blooms? Analyzing data from 2021, the CDC found 368 of these blooms across 16 states that year – Arizona, California, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and Wyoming. Michigan and Pennsylvania had the most algal blooms – 77 each – while Utah had the most human illnesses. Washington had the most animal illnesses, as the toxic algae was linked to the deaths of more than 2,000 bats. California had the second-most animal cases, with 444 animals affected. The problem became worse during the summer months with the blooms peaking in August. In 2021, 248 of the blooms had no associated illnesses, while 48 were known to cause human illness, 79 caused animal illness and seven caused illnesses for both groups. More than half of the blooms, however, were filled with toxins. Most were in freshwater sources, such as lakes and reservoirs. In those, a ""green water color"" was frequently reported, the CDC said, although there were reports of illness when the water was clear. Unlike red tide events , which have long plagued Florida's waters, these blooms involve algae or cyanobacteria, which is also referred to as blue-green algae. Red tide, on the other hand, is formed by the bacteria Karenia brevis, which can make the water appear red or brown. How do harmful algal blooms affect humans? The CDC found that 117 people became ill after coming into contact with harmful blooms in 2021, about half of them children and teens. Just under three-quarters of those who became ill sought medical care, but there were no deaths. Most of the human illnesses related to the blooms occurred in June, the CDC found, and primarily in public outdoor areas and beaches. The most common symptoms people reported were gastrointestinal issues – mostly diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain – headaches, fatigue, fever, rashes, itchy and irritated skin, sore throat and coughing. How do harmful algal blooms affect animals? Animals were far more impacted by the harmful blooms in 2021 than humans, according to the CDC. At least 2,715 animals became sick from the blooms, with at least 92% dying from their exposure. Wildlife was overwhelmingly affected, although dogs and cattle were also among those affected. Most of the deaths occurred in Washington, where at least 2,000 bats died. The problem for animals was at its worst in August, when the blooms were at their peak. For pets, the most common symptoms of HAB-related illness were loss of appetite, lethargy, muscle tremors, weakness, vomiting and imbalance, although several other symptoms were reported. Among wildlife, the most common symptom of illness was dark urine. Toxic algal blooms could get worse The CDC said in its report that harmful algal bloom events ""can be intensified by factors such as nutrient pollution and warmer water temperature"" – both of which are expected to increase with climate change. As regional and global temperatures warm, so will the temperatures in freshwater systems, Indiana University's Environmental Resilience Institute says. ""Warmer water temperatures in deep lakes slows down processes that add oxygen to the water, creating dead zones, or areas with less oxygen that are unable to support life,"" according to the institute. ""These dead zones can produce large-scale fish mortality and toxic algal blooms."" Nutrient pollution is also expected to increase, as climate change spurs more extreme weather that can lead to more stormwater runoff. That runoff ""can result in conditions favorable for algal blooms,"" the university says. ""Consequently, with a changing climate, harmful algal blooms can occur more often, in more fresh or marine waterbodies and can be more intense,"" they said, adding that it could also end up affecting drinking water, as freshwater sources will need more treatment than usual.

The symposium was hosted by NEIWPCC , a regional commission that helps Northeastern states preserve and advance water quality, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, and the U.S. Geological Survey, with support from the U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Within this setting, about 500 attendees discussed progress in understanding algal bloom ecology and the solutions necessary to prevent and reduce HABs. Panelists Mike Bilecki (NPS), Dr. Victoria Christensen (USGS), Dr. Hannah Bonner (State of Utah) Dr. Jennifer Graham (USGS), Jamie Kilgo (NPS), and Dr. Kerensa King (NPS) USGS Photo As part of the conference, the NPS and USGS hosted a Plenary Panel Discussion called “Harmful Algal Bloom Science and Management in National Parks.” Dr. Jennifer Graham, Dr. Victoria Christensen, and Hayley Olds, USGS, along with Dr. Danielle Buttke, Jamie Kilgo, and Dr. Kerensa King, NPS, convened a panel of park managers, scientists, and partners to share their experiences with HABs in national parks. The session combined in-person and recorded presentations that explored ongoing and recently completed research, collaborative partnerships, and management challenges. Dr. Jennifer Graham, USGS, moderated the panel and Dr. Kerensa King, NPS, set the stage by detailing the effects HABs events have on park units nationwide, ranging from excess biomass to significant wildlife die-offs. Panelists then shared first-hand accounts about their experiences dealing with HABs in national parks.

NPS Photo / Nicki Gibney Kelly Nesvacil, NPS, described Padre Island National Seashore’s history of HABs in both marine and freshwater areas. Since 2000, six Red Tide HAB events have affected large swaths of the park’s marine waters. Red Tides commonly cause coyote and bird mortalities, and in some cases, result in mass fish die-offs. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department leads HAB response coordination, and the park works closely with the state to monitor the blooms and issue advisories. Similarly, Brown Tide HAB events have led to eelgrass declines and shellfish mortality in the Great South Bay along Fire Island National Seashore. Mike Bilecki, NPS, spoke about the Seashore’s limited capacity to address all the natural resource challenges facing the park and stressed the importance of partnerships with nearby universities and with other agencies for HAB monitoring and research. While some parks like Padre Island and Fire Island National Seashores have been responding to HABs for many years, others have only recently detected their first HAB. In July 2020, a dog death at Zion National Park tipped off park managers to the presence of benthic algae capable of producing a potent neurotoxin growing in the park’s rivers. Robyn Henderek, NPS, outlined the park’s response to the newly detected benthic blooms; they used a multiple lines of evidence approach with complimentary monitoring methods to determine when to issue recreational advisories for visitors. Dr. Hannah Bonner, State of Utah, further highlighted the widespread concern for benthic HABs in highly recreated waters of Utah. Benthic algal species capable of producing toxins have been found in five Utah national parks and a changing climate may favor these species. Canaveral National Seashore’s Women In Parks interns working hard on identifying phytoplankton. NPS photo Interdisciplinary collaborations with Federal and State agencies, universities, Tribes, and grass-roots organizations enable the diverse range of research and monitoring being conducted to better understand HABs. St. Croix National Scenic Riverway partnered with the Wild Rivers Conservancy and USGS to develop a HAB citizen monitoring program called the Algae Alert Network. Marian Shaffer, NPS, said the program is a huge success and benefits both the volunteers who learn more about stewardship of the river and NPS who gains data about HABs along the length of the riverway. The USGS-NPS Water Quality Partnership Program supports critical water-quality research in national parks. Numerous ongoing studies funded by the partnership focus on HAB drivers and impacts in parks. Hayley Olds, USGS, and Jamie Kilgo, NPS, presented on a nationwide study that aims to understand algal toxin occurrence in 21 parks and to develop tools and strategies that parks can use to monitor, assess, and mitigate the effects of HABs in their freshwater and marine resources. Dr. Victoria Christensen, USGS, spoke about a long-term partnership between USGS and Voyageurs National Park to study HABs and collect consistent datasets. Her research indicates that water levels, which are controlled by an international agreement between the USA and Canada, are an important factor in eutrophication and thus in bloom development. Dr. Jennifer Graham, USGS, ended the session describing a cautionary tale from Dr. Danielle Buttke, NPS. In 2021, several bison died in Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve and HABs were immediately tapped as a potential cause of the deaths. Graham said that only a few years ago, HABs were not on the forefront of managers’ minds when dealing with wildlife health issues and likely would not have been considered as cause of the bison deaths. And while HABs and the toxins they can produce are a concern for wildlife health, in this case, the cause of death was determined to be caused by bacteria. As HAB impacts become better known by resource managers, this story underscores the importance of investigating wildlife health issues thoroughly and not jumping to conclusions. Strong partnerships that support HAB monitoring, response, and mitigation were a fundamental theme throughout the panel discussion. Parks face a myriad of challenges from HABs and they cannot address them all alone. NPS and USGS look forward to continuing to work with our partners.

Here's why and how you can stay safe. Climate change is expected to accelerate the trend of hotter temperatures and drier weather conditions, and that could mean more algal bloom outbreaks in the future Gareth McGrath USA TODAY NETWORK Stifling heat amid periods of dry weather has officials warning residents to be on the look out for something more than cranky alligators in the region's waters: algal blooms. This summer has seen a surge in algal blooms reported to the N.C. Division of Water Resources . The blooms, while rarely fatal to humans, can cause irritations such as skin rashes, burns, and blistering of the mouth and other more serious symptoms if ingested. But the outbreaks can prove deadly to dogs, fish, wildlife and livestock if they involve toxic forms of cyanobacteria . “Cyanobacteria love it when its hot, and the hotter it is the better they do,” said Dr. Larry Cahoon , a marine biologist at the University of North Carolina Wilmington . A study by UNCW researchers published in the July issue of the journal Water looked at more than 80 algal blooms in the Wilmington area between 2019 and 2022 and highlighted the potentially dangerous health conditions posed by toxic cyanobacteria in ponds and waterways easily accessible to the public. Nutrients like fertilizer washing off yards and farms into waterways and ponds are the primary cause of algal blooms, which can have negative impacts on aquatic environments by blocking sunlight when they form thick mats of green scum on the surface and rob waters of dissolved oxygen when they die. Wilmington's Greenfield Lake, for example, is notorious for having periodic outbreaks as the shallow lake that acts as a stormwater catchment area for much of the Port City south of downtown is warmed up by the hot summer sun. ""With all the development we've seen, this area has become a nutrient-rich environment that fuels these outbreaks,"" Cahoon said. In July, people reported 59 algal blooms and 12 reports of fish kills, and 10 outbreaks involving both to the state, according to an online dashboard maintained by water resources. That compares to four algal blooms and eight fish kills in June. Through mid-August the division has received 20 reports of algal blooms and eight reports of fish kills. Folks have reported four algal blooms in New Hanover County since July 22 − two in Kure Beach, one near Sea Breeze and another one in a detention pond in Monkey Junction. A bloom also was reported in Brunswick County's St. James Plantation in May. So far in 2023 the agency has received 97 reports of algal blooms, 35 fish kills, and 12 cases involving both. In all of 2021 there were 90 algal blooms and 44 fish kills reported. Hot, humid and dry What's responsible for the surge in blooms and fish kills? Cahoon said it's a combination of the recent spate of hot temperatures − even by North Carolina summer standards − and fast-moving, short rain showers. He said when it rains, the runoff carries nutrients into local creeks, lakes and retention ponds. ""But if it's just a cloudburst and stops raining, then there's nothing to flush out the enormous amount of nutrient material that's been washed into these ponds,"" Cahoon said. Add blazing heat and the result is a petri dish for algal formation in many cases. Much of Eastern North Carolina, including northern Pender County, also are back in drought after weeks of abnormally dry weather. According to the National Weather Service's Wilmington office, temperatures in July were higher than normal. The average maximum temperature was 90.9 degrees, versus a normal of 90 degrees. The average minimum temperature was 74.8 degrees compared to a normal July of 73 degrees. The average temperature last month, according to the weather service, was 82.9 degrees. The normal for Julys in the Port City is 81.5 degrees. In June, the average maximum temperature was 91 degrees versus a normal of 90. But the average minimum temperature and average temperature overall were slightly below historic normals. Temperatures in August have been above normal levels in Wilmington. Through the first 16 days of the month the average maximum high was 90.3 degrees compared to a normal of 89 degrees. The average temperature also was higher than normal at 82.1 degrees compared to a normal of 80.7, according to the weather service. Rainfall also was down at 2.86 inches through Wednesday versus a historic normal of 3.98 inches. With climate change forecast to bring a warmer and drier future for North Carolina, Cahoon said he sees little reason to think that we won't be seeing more and more outbreaks in coming years, even though local governments like Wilmington are testing pilot projects and increasing education efforts to try and reduce nutrient levels before they reach local waterways. New Hanover and Wilmington officials also have installed signs near retention ponds warning people not to swim, fish, kayak or let their pets in the water. ""More algal blooms are certainly in our future,"" Cahoon said. ""I see no factor or process at work right now that’s going to stop that.” Want to report an algal bloom or fish kill?

(Beth LaBerge/KQED) The red tide that killed an immeasurable number of fish in San Francisco Bay last year has again emerged, covering parts of the bay in a light brown sheen. The state agency in charge of regulating flows into the bay held a press conference in early August alerting the public about the return of the tea-colored water. This alert came after an environmental watchdog group, San Francisco Baykeeper, received a series of calls at the end of July about a reddish-brown film floating on the surface of the water in places like Berkeley, Emeryville, Albany and Tiburon . Environmental scientists believe the algal bloom, while a natural occurrence and likely not harmful to human health, is fueled by treated sewage put out by wastewater treatment plants across the Bay Area — and could be worsened by climate change. Scientists aren’t sure how large this bloom will grow or how many fish will die, but they are examining the organism closely. Still, scientists are sure of one thing: Humans are a big part of the problem. Jump straight to: Is the red tide harmful to humans or pets? What should I do if I find a red tide or a dead fish? Can I still fish in the bay? How is the red tide related to climate change? “It’s almost all about us to blame,” said Peter Roopnarine, curator of invertebrate zoology & geology at the California Academy of Sciences. “The bay is kind of a gigantic laboratory flask in some ways where you can put in ingredients, can mix them and it’s not easy for those to have an outside influence from the ocean.” Keep reading for what you need to know about this latest algal bloom. What is red tide? Ominous sounding, the term red tide is broadly defined. It typically means anytime a bloom of phytoplankton — microscopic plant-like organisms that are the base of the marine food web — discolor a body of water to the point it is visible to the human eye. More Outdoor Guides From KQED Red tides aren’t always red. They can in fact range from rusty orange to brown to green, but millions (if not billions or trillions) of these little creatures are needed for a red tide to be visible. Not every red tide, or algal bloom, is toxic — although they can be. The species behind the recurring algal bloom in San Francisco Bay is called Heterosigma akashiwo and isn’t known at this time to be toxic to humans (see more below). The microscopic critter looks like a swimming potato chip with a tail, said Raphael Kudela, a phytoplankton ecologist at UC Santa Cruz. He said the organism thrives in the bay because the shallow water warms up quickly. Plus, it’s full of tasty treats it likes to fill up on. “It’s just really happy when it’s in the bay,” he said. “As long as it’s happy, it’s just going to keep going, and going, and going. And that’s basically what a red tide is.” Reddish-brown water due to an algae bloom can be seen in the Berkeley Marina on July 31, 2023. (Beth LaBerge/KQED) Is the red tide harmful to humans or pets?? Scientists don’t think the red tide in the bay harms human health or pets, but they are hesitant to say that for certain. For that reason, experts do not recommend swimming in — or otherwise coming into contact with — murky water. David Senn, senior scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute, (SFEI) said there’s very little information available about the toxicity of the algae on people when they come in contact with it. That’s why the general guidance is: Don’t take a dip into areas of the bay where blooms are present. “It makes sense to avoid discolored water in general, particularly in this case,” he said. What is known is that an algae bloom of this nature often kills fish by eliminating the oxygen they need to breathe in the water. (Jump to more information about what to do if you find a dead fish or other organism near a red tide. ) A photo submitted by Damon Tighe to inaturalist.org, showing a dead bat ray found in Emeryville. (Damon Tighe via inaturalist.org) But there is a caveat for humans, said Kudela at UC Santa Cruz. Dense red tides are often accompanied by organic material and bacteria, which can harm human health. “The Heterosigma is not going to harm humans or dogs. But just being in that organic soup, you could be exposed to pathogenic bacteria or other things,” he said. “If the water is super thick and red, you probably don’t want to be in it anyway.” In short: While the risks are probably low, it’s just a good idea to keep yourself — and your pets — out of a body of water that has a red tide. What do I do if I spot a red tide?? To report a red tide or algae bloom you can reach SF Baykeeper’s pollution hotline by: Calling 1-800-KEEP-Bay. Emailing hotline@baykeeper.org. Filling out a form online to submit a confidential pollution tip. Algal blooms can also be reported to the California State Water Resources Control Board’s Freshwater and Estuarine Harmful Algal Bloom (FHAB) Program. You can reach the agency hotline by: Calling 1-844-729-6466. Emailing CyanoHAB.Reports@waterboards.ca.gov. Filling out a digital form to submit an algal bloom report . If you’re reporting a red tide, be sure to include the time, date, location and a description of what you saw. Spotted a dead fish near a red tide? To report a dead fish in an area where there is red tide present, you can download the app iNaturalist . The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is collecting these observations of dead organisms related to the algae bloom in San Francisco Bay, so make sure you log a photo, location and (if possible) species. Read more about how to report dead fish using iNaturalist from The Oaklandside . A map of the Bay Area on inaturalist.org showing user reports of dead organisms around a red tide (inaturalist.org) Can I continue fishing in the bay with the algae present? UC Santa Cruz’s Kudela said it’s perfectly fine to continue fishing in the bay, even in areas where the algae bloom is present because the algae do not contaminate the meat of the fish. ‘While it can kill the fish, if you’re eating the meat and cleaning it, there’s no risk,” Kudela said. “It’s up to you whether you want to fish or eat stressed fish, but there’s nothing wrong with fishing.” Keep reading for more background on the 2023 algal bloom. What is causing this year’s algal bloom? Heterosigma akashiwo got lucky in 2023 — for the second year in a row. A series of environmental conditions are allowing this minuscule creature to show up en masse. This organism needs four things to flourish: light, warm water, relatively calm water and oodles of food. It got all four this summer. Scientists think the organism deposited itself in sediment under the bay after it died off last year, acting like a dormant seed until the right conditions allow it to grow. This year, the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board has confirmed the organism in bay waters near Emeryville, Albany, the Berkeley Marina, Richardson Bay and Belvedere Cove. Since the bay’s east side is often shallow — water heats up faster there than in other parts of the region — the red tide was first spotted there, likely because it’s an ideal place for the algae to thrive. Tell us: Is there another guide to something you’d like to read? “It’s definitely responding to warm temperatures,” said UC Santa Cruz’s Kudela. The organisms swim near the water’s surface during daytime hours to gather more light and swim toward nutrients. With winter storms long in the rearview mirror, tides in the bay also are at their mellowest point of the year, which decreases ocean water circulation into the bay. The algae also have a lot to eat for several reasons. They munch on tiny particles, nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus. While naturally occurring, there is an influx of these nutrients into the bay from 37 wastewater treatment plants that discharge treated sewage into the bay. This rush of nutrients provides a buffet for the algae to feast upon, allowing them to grow voraciously. “San Francisco Bay has some of the highest levels of nutrient pollution of any estuary in the world,” said Jon Rosenfield, senior scientist with SF Baykeeper. An algae bloom in the San Francisco Bay near the Berkeley Marina on July 31, 2023. (Beth LaBerge/KQED) When will the red tide go away? In the near term, scientists say nothing can be done to stop a red tide once it shows up. “You just have to wait for conditions to change,” said Kudela. The options are limited. The algae can consume all the nutrients like PAC-MAN eating dots in a video game until there isn’t enough left to support the organism. Or a heavy rain storm or a wind event can churn up the bay, altering the water’s temperature, and reversing the conditions that can support it. Some scientists think that’s what caused the red tide to dissipate last year. “We had some really big wind events, and it was gone,” said William Cochlan, a marine biologist and an emeritus professor at San Francisco State University. “The winds stir up the whole system, they don’t get enough light and that’s usually the end of the bloom.” But the algae, in this case, are tricksters. Scientists believe that when their conditions change, they produce a cyst and embed themselves into the sediment at the bottom of the bay, not emerging again until the right conditions persist for them to grow. SFEI’s Senn said they don’t yet know what triggers the cysts to hatch. His team is testing the bay’s water and monitoring satellite imagery to see if the bloom is expanding. “What struck the match last year was a mystery. But once the match was struck, it was enough for this organism to get a toehold and then it had fuel to continue to grow,” said Senn. What are scientists and officials doing to address the red tide? In the long term, the region’s 37 wastewater treatment plants can limit the nutrient pollution they dump into the San Francisco Bay. These plants regularly discharge treated sewage water full of tiny particles, which algae love to devour. Cochlan said these plants contribute “the vast majority” of the nutrients (or algae food) into the bay, especially during the summer when the water is warmer. Next year, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board will consider changing its rules for these plants, when their permits are up for renewal. This is an opportunity for regulators to clamp down on the nutrient load the plants are allowed to release. While these plants treat the sewage, most do not filter out all the nutrients before discharging the water into the bay. Fixing the problem could cost at least $12 billion and maybe twice that much, according to Bay Area Clean Water Agencies, which represent local water districts. Some plants are already redesigning their facilities to reduce the amount of nutrients released into the bay, said Eileen White, the water board executive officer. But not all plants are doing that — and there is currently no formal requirement for plant operators to reduce the discharged nutrient loads. Climate scientists also say red tides will likely occur more often as the climate warms and raises water temperatures. The even bigger fix is addressing climate change at its root by ending the burning of fossil fuels that cause global warming. What does climate change have to do with red tides? Climate change will likely increase the frequency of red tides because the bay and ocean will be warmer. The bay could also absorb more runoff during significant wet years and less water during periods of drought. This off-and-on cycle could accentuate the warm and relatively calm conditions the algae proliferate in. “We could expect more unpredictable and more frequent algal blooms of all kinds,” said Kudela at UC Santa Cruz. “It’s not surprising that we’re seeing bigger and longer-lasting blooms as the climate shifts.” The increasing water temperature is critical to the algae’s lifespan, and a warming climate only increases the odds of the species thriving in the bay, said San Francisco State University’s Cochlan. “We may be exacerbating these plumes, making them more frequent, of greater duration and more intense by increasing temperature through climate change,” he said. “We have to expect to see these changes in the bay or the coast with climate change,” Cochlan said. Cleaning up what the treatment plants dump into the bay and warming water is “like a one-two punch — and we really need to tackle both of the problems,” said Emily Jeffers, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “But the one that we can address more readily and more quickly is the nutrient loads from the wastewater-treatment facilities.” Sponsored Is the Bay Area red tide related to the algal bloom off the Southern California coast? The red tide in San Francisco Bay is unrelated to the algal bloom in the Pacific Ocean, currently off the coast of Southern California . The organism causing the death of dolphins and sea lions is a different type of algae, Pseudo-nitzschia , that causes the production of a neurotoxin called domoic acid. That toxin is transmitted via the complex food web. Birds and marine mammals can die when ingesting the toxin in animals and fish that they eat. “They get a big dose of domoic acid; it causes brain damage,” said Kudela. “Humans can get the same thing, but almost nobody in California gets sick because it’s super well regulated. But it can get into the shellfish and things like spiny lobster.” The algae bloom in the bay and in the Pacific Ocean are similar because they’re both phytoplankton blooms and flourish in relatively warmer water, although at somewhat different temperatures. The more dangerous algae currently circulating in the Pacific Ocean could spread into the bay if the conditions are right. But Kudela said the likelihood of that happening is slim because the bay is consistently too warm for the species. Tell us: What else do you need information about?

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work. Oh, that works really well,’” Mitchell said. “I want to laud them for trying it first.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n"",""blocks"":[],""excerpt"":""Following Gov.

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work.

But once the match was struck, it was enough for this organism to get a toehold and then it had fuel to continue to grow,” said Senn.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>What are scientists and officials doing to address the red tide?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>In the long term, the region’s 37 wastewater treatment plants can limit the nutrient pollution they dump into the San Francisco Bay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These plants regularly discharge treated sewage water full of tiny particles, which algae love to devour. Cochlan said these plants contribute “the vast majority” of the nutrients (or algae food) into the bay, especially during the summer when the water is warmer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Next year, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board will consider changing its rules for these plants, when their permits are up for renewal. This is an opportunity for regulators to clamp down on the nutrient load the plants are allowed to release.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While these plants treat the sewage, most do not filter out all the nutrients before discharging the water into the bay. Fixing the problem could cost at least $12 billion and maybe twice that much, according to Bay Area Clean Water Agencies, which represent local water districts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some plants are already redesigning their facilities to reduce the amount of nutrients released into the bay, said Eileen White, the water board executive officer. But not all plants are doing that — and there is currently no formal requirement for plant operators to reduce the discharged nutrient loads.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Climate scientists also say red tides will likely occur more often as the climate warms and raises water temperatures. The even bigger fix is addressing climate change at its root by ending the burning of fossil fuels that cause global warming.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003ca id=\""redtideclimatechange\"">\u003c/a>What does climate change have to do with red tides?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>Climate change will likely increase the frequency of red tides because the bay and ocean will be warmer. The bay could also absorb more runoff during significant wet years and less water during periods of drought. This off-and-on cycle could accentuate the warm and relatively calm conditions the algae proliferate in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We could expect more unpredictable and more frequent algal blooms of all kinds,” said Kudela at UC Santa Cruz. “It’s not surprising that we’re seeing bigger and longer-lasting blooms as the climate shifts.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The increasing water temperature is critical to the algae’s lifespan, and a warming climate only increases the odds of the species thriving in the bay, said San Francisco State University’s Cochlan.\u003cbr>\n“We may be exacerbating these plumes, making them more frequent, of greater duration and more intense by increasing temperature through climate change,” he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We have to expect to see these changes in the bay or the coast with climate change,” Cochlan said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cleaning up what the treatment plants dump into the bay and warming water is “like a one-two punch — and we really need to tackle both of the problems,” said Emily Jeffers, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“But the one that we can address more readily and more quickly is the nutrient loads from the wastewater-treatment facilities.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad fullwidth]\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Is the Bay Area red tide related to the algal bloom off the Southern California coast?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>The red tide in San Francisco Bay is unrelated to \u003ca href=\""https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-07/as-toxic-algae-bloom-afflicts-california-coast-wildlife-care-center-calls-for-aid\"">the algal bloom in the Pacific Ocean, currently off the coast of Southern California\u003c/a>. The organism causing the death of dolphins and sea lions is \u003ca href=\""https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/toxic-algal-bloom-suspected-dolphin-and-sea-lion-deaths-southern-california\"">a different type of algae, Pseudo-nitzschia\u003c/a>, that causes the production of a neurotoxin called domoic acid.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>That toxin is transmitted via the complex food web. Birds and marine mammals can die when ingesting the toxin in animals and fish that they eat.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“They get a big dose of domoic acid; it causes brain damage,” said Kudela. “Humans can get the same thing, but almost nobody in California gets sick because it’s super well regulated. But it can get into the shellfish and things like spiny lobster.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The algae bloom in the bay and in the Pacific Ocean are similar because they’re both phytoplankton blooms and flourish in relatively warmer water, although at somewhat different temperatures. The more dangerous algae currently circulating in the Pacific Ocean could spread into the bay if the conditions are right. But Kudela said the likelihood of that happening is slim because the bay is consistently too warm for the species.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>\u003ca id=\""tellus\"">\u003c/a>Tell us: What else do you need information about?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>At KQED, we know that it can sometimes be hard to track down the answers to navigate life in the Bay Area in 2023.

They munch on tiny particles, nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus.

The algae can consume all the nutrients like PAC-MAN eating dots in a video game until there isn’t enough left to support the organism. Or a heavy rain storm or a wind event can churn up the bay, altering the water’s temperature, and reversing the conditions that can support it. Some scientists think that’s what caused the red tide to dissipate last year.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We had some really big wind events, and it was gone,” said William Cochlan, a marine biologist and an emeritus professor at San Francisco State University. “The winds stir up the whole system, they don’t get enough light and that’s usually the end of the bloom.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>But the algae, in this case, are tricksters. Scientists believe that when their conditions change, they produce a cyst and embed themselves into the sediment at the bottom of the bay, not emerging again until the right conditions persist for them to grow.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>SFEI’s Senn said they don’t yet know what triggers the cysts to hatch. His team is testing the bay’s water and monitoring satellite imagery to see if the bloom is expanding.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“What struck the match last year was a mystery. But once the match was struck, it was enough for this organism to get a toehold and then it had fuel to continue to grow,” said Senn.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>What are scientists and officials doing to address the red tide?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>In the long term, the region’s 37 wastewater treatment plants can limit the nutrient pollution they dump into the San Francisco Bay.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These plants regularly discharge treated sewage water full of tiny particles, which algae love to devour. Cochlan said these plants contribute “the vast majority” of the nutrients (or algae food) into the bay, especially during the summer when the water is warmer.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Next year, the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board will consider changing its rules for these plants, when their permits are up for renewal. This is an opportunity for regulators to clamp down on the nutrient load the plants are allowed to release.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>While these plants treat the sewage, most do not filter out all the nutrients before discharging the water into the bay. Fixing the problem could cost at least $12 billion and maybe twice that much, according to Bay Area Clean Water Agencies, which represent local water districts.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Some plants are already redesigning their facilities to reduce the amount of nutrients released into the bay, said Eileen White, the water board executive officer. But not all plants are doing that — and there is currently no formal requirement for plant operators to reduce the discharged nutrient loads.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Climate scientists also say red tides will likely occur more often as the climate warms and raises water temperatures.

The bay could also absorb more runoff during significant wet years and less water during periods of drought. This off-and-on cycle could accentuate the warm and relatively calm conditions the algae proliferate in.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We could expect more unpredictable and more frequent algal blooms of all kinds,” said Kudela at UC Santa Cruz. “It’s not surprising that we’re seeing bigger and longer-lasting blooms as the climate shifts.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The increasing water temperature is critical to the algae’s lifespan, and a warming climate only increases the odds of the species thriving in the bay, said San Francisco State University’s Cochlan.\u003cbr>\n“We may be exacerbating these plumes, making them more frequent, of greater duration and more intense by increasing temperature through climate change,” he said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“We have to expect to see these changes in the bay or the coast with climate change,” Cochlan said.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Cleaning up what the treatment plants dump into the bay and warming water is “like a one-two punch — and we really need to tackle both of the problems,” said Emily Jeffers, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“But the one that we can address more readily and more quickly is the nutrient loads from the wastewater-treatment facilities.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003c/p>\u003c/div>"",""attributes"":{""named"":{},""numeric"":[]}},{""type"":""component"",""content"":"""",""name"":""ad"",""attributes"":{""named"":{""label"":""fullwidth""},""numeric"":[""fullwidth""]}},{""type"":""contentString"",""content"":""\u003cdiv class=\""post-body\"">\u003cp>\u003c/p>\n\u003ch2>Is the Bay Area red tide related to the algal bloom off the Southern California coast?\u003c/h2>\n\u003cp>The red tide in San Francisco Bay is unrelated to \u003ca href=\""https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-07-07/as-toxic-algae-bloom-afflicts-california-coast-wildlife-care-center-calls-for-aid\"">the algal bloom in the Pacific Ocean, currently off the coast of Southern California\u003c/a>.

Play Video Thousands of acres of seagrass in Florida have died because of nutrient pollution that has caused algae blooms and left manatees without an adequate food source. Learn more about this issue, projects that are being undertaken, and ways you can help. The Indian River Lagoon (IRL) stretches for 156 miles along Florida’s east central coast. There are more than 4,400 species of plants and animals—including manatees—that are found in the lagoon watershed. Unfortunately, as the direct result of human derelictions over many decades, the Indian River Lagoon has suffered a series of harmful algal blooms, leading to massive losses in seagrass coverage and, in turn, the recent deaths of a heart-rending number of manatees equal to over 25% of the estimated manatee population. Trouble for Manatees in the Indian River Lagoon Note: data is preliminary. As of February 6, 2023, there were 800 confirmed carcasses recovered in 2022. Click to view a full-size version of this map. An excess of nitrogen and phosphorus in waterways can fuel algae and cause it to grow faster than the ecosystem can tolerate. In the IRL, a combination of improperly treated sewage, leaking septic systems, fertilizers, and stormwater runoff has led to eutrophication. This means that frequent harmful algal blooms have blocked the light necessary for photosynthesis. The result: the tragic loss of more than 90% of the seagrass biomass within the Indian River Lagoon. Before the IRL can be functionally restored, it will be necessary to prevent new sources of nutrient pollution from entering the lagoon as well as strategically removing or sequestering legacy nutrients to make them unavailable as a source of new Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB). Ideally, seagrasses will begin to reestablish on their own, but the process may be facilitated through the restoration of filter feeding organisms and selective pilot seagrass restoration projects. Ultimately, we must reverse those conditions that lead to the loss of seagrasses in the first place if we are going to restore seagrasses. In 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) declared an Unusual Mortality Event (UME) for manatees. A UME involves a significant die-off of any marine mammal population and demands immediate response. Manatees gathering at warm water locations—such as power plants—along the IRL have faced an additional threat, beginning with the 2020-2021 winter season, because there has been very little seagrass or other vegetation for them to eat in the immediate vicinity. Traveling further for forage would mean deadly exposure to cold water, so the manatees ultimately choose to forgo feeding over dying from the cold. Between December 2020 and December 2022, over 2,000 manatees perished in Florida. 744 of those deaths occurred in Brevard County, which is considered the epicenter of the Unusual Mortality Event. See our opinion editorial: A State of Emergency for Manatees in the Indian River Lagoon and Beyond. Get more information from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) on the Manatee UME . Watch Indian River Lagoon: Why All of Us Should Love Seagrass , an informative webinar from the Marine Discovery Center. Florida Department of Environmental Protection – Algal Bloom Sampling Status . MOTE Marine Laboratory – Beach Conditions Reporting System . In a healthy ecosystem, free-ranging manatee grazing makes seagrass communities more productive. Manatees have evolved along with seagrass communities for millions of years and primarily crop the grasses rather than uprooting entire plants, which can actually stimulate the grasses to grow. The loss of seagrass in the IRL is largely due to persistent and recurring environmental events that have changed the ecosystem over time—especially from human sources of pollution. What Else Is Being Done to Help Malnourished Manatees? Save the Manatee Club is a founding member of the Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation Partnership (MRP), a network of partners who participate in the rescue, rehabilitation, release, and post-release monitoring of sick or injured manatees. We are working together with our partners in the MRP to identify manatees in distress due to devastating seagrass losses in Indian River Lagoon. Save the Manatee Club and our partners are also working diligently on improving water quality to enable natural regrowth of seagrasses and to replant areas where replanting is feasible now. See Save the Manatee Club’s Work below for more information on our activities to help manatees during the UME. An emaciated manatee is rescued by the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC). Photo courtesy FWC. If you are at all concerned that a manatee may be sick, injured, entangled, or orphaned, or if you see a manatee that is being harassed or wearing a ""tag"" or tracking device, please immediately report it to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) 24-hour Wildlife Alert Hotline by calling 1-888-404-3922 (FWCC). What You Can Do Excessive human-produced nutrient pollution is a growing threat to all seagrass communities. When combined with the warming effects of climate change and sea level rise, these excess nutrients present an even greater danger to the future of seagrasses wherever they are found. While there are many large-scale sources of pollution, it’s impossible to overstate the value of individual actions. What you do at home can make a big impact—whether you live near the Indian River Lagoon or not. Most people in the United States live in a watershed (a land area that drains to a river, lake, ocean, or other waterway)! Please don’t feed or give manatees water. Giving food or water to manatees is illegal and teaches them to associate people and/or boats with handouts, which changes their behavior and puts them in harm’s way. Here are some examples of direct actions you can take to protect our waterways While Save the Manatee Club works with our partners to strengthen policies that protect water quality, the individual actions of each Florida resident can make a big difference for the health of our waterways. Learn how to do your part and take Save the Manatee Club's pledge to be Fertilizer-Free for Manatees. Help reduce pollution and prevent harmful algal blooms from forming. Fertilize less, or not at all. Many established landscapes may not need fertilizer. When in doubt, if you must use fertilizer, apply slow-release nitrogen fertilizers to your lawn only once per year. Your local UF-IFAS Extension Office can assist with soil tests, plant recommendations, and specific lawn questions. Follow Florida Friendly Landscaping™ principles . Know your local fertilizer regulations . Take Save the Manatee Club’s Pledge to be Fertilizer-Free . Keep yard debris like grass clippings away from stormwater drains. Properly maintain your home septic system to ensure it does not leak. Have your systems inspected every 3-5 years. If you can, consider transferring your home to a city sewer system. Pick up and properly dispose of your pet’s waste. Sign up for cleanups and other events to help protect the manatee’s aquatic habitat. You can find them on the Save the Manatee Club Upcoming Events and Facebook Events . You can sign up to volunteer for future seagrass planting projects here .

Prevent damage to seagrasses by avoiding boating over seagrass beds. If you must boat over seagrass beds, trim up your motor and idle to a safe depth before getting on plane, and carefully push your boat away if you run aground. Send a message to President Biden and your U.S. senators and representative urging them to come to the aid of manatees and the Indian River Lagoon. Send a message to Florida governor Ron DeSantis , asking him to stop the degradation of Florida’s waterways and lead the way in safeguarding the aquatic environment for manatees, other wildlife, and for people, too. More Information Save the Manatee Club's Work Save the Manatee Club is engaged in numerous activities to protect critical habitat for manatees and water quality standards in Florida. Legal and Political Activities SMC advocates for stronger protections for manatees and their aquatic habitat both at the state level in Florida and federally, pressing agencies to address the decades of excess nutrient pollution entering our waterways and leading to Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) that devastate seagrasses and other manatee forage. We also advocate for the addition of Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration as a component of President Biden’s Infrastructure Improvement Initiative. Together with the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife, we filed suit against the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in order to compel the agency to update the manatee’s critical habitat under the Endangered Species Act. In June, FWS committed to do so by September 2024. In May 2022, Save the Manatee Club joined the Center for Biological Diversity and Defenders of Wildlife in filing suit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for failing to protect manatees and sea turtles from water pollution in Florida. SMC is also urging FWS to restore the manatee’s status as an endangered species, as they were prematurely downgraded in 2017. Save the Manatee Club has a long and continuing history of working with the state of Florida to develop stronger Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs), which are “blueprints” for restoring impaired waters by reducing pollutant loadings. SMC advocates for more conservative Minimum Flows and Levels (MFLs), which help protect water resources from significant harm from water withdrawals, as well as waterway restoration plans. Networking, Programming, and Outreach In Summer 2022, Save the Manatee Club’s Fertilizer-Free for Manatees program saw hundreds of Florida residents take the pledge to be fertilizer-free. Campaign billboards in counties along Florida’s east coast reached over 2 million viewers. The program will continue into 2023. We have worked to strengthen partnerships with agencies, universities and non-profits working to restore seagrass, clams, mangroves and water quality in the Indian River Lagoon. SMC staff members attend conferences, working group meetings, and workshops, and participate in field work to learn about ongoing restoration work in the Indian River Lagoon and how Save the Manatee Club could best support these efforts. SMC is a member of the Rivers Coalition and the Indian River Lagoon National Estuary Program Stem Advisory Committee . We have partnered with the Marine Resources Council to host the Seagrass Assembly, a two-day gathering bringing together experts in the field of seagrass management, research and restoration in the Indian River Lagoon. Save the Manatee Club has increased public awareness of these issues through numerous presentations, interviews, and media coverage. PBS: Changing Seas NPR: “Saving starving manatees will mean saving this crucial lagoon habitat” Christian Science Monitor: “Saving starving manatees: Can Florida solve a man-made crisis?” PBS News Hour: “Biologists take drastic measures to save Florida manatees at risk of starvation” Op-Ed: “A State of Emergency for Manatees in the Indian River Lagoon and Beyond” Florida Manatees are Dying of Starvation at an Alarming Rate Patrick Rose, Save the Manatee Club Executive Director is interviewed on The Weekly on News 6 Webinar: What’s Going on With the Manatees in the Indian River Lagoon? See our News page for more. Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation Save the Manatee Club participates as a charter member and Fiduciary Sponsor of the Manatee Rescue and Rehabilitation Partnership (MRP) and sponsors many partner efforts in the MRP by providing equipment and funding. We also work with partners to release rehabilitated manatees at Blue Spring State Park as an alternative to the IRL area as a safe, warm site with plenty of vegetation. Funding Save the Manatee Club has provided necessary funding for a variety of projects and programs, including to: Florida Oceanographic Society in support the expansion of their Citizen Science Seagrass Network, which monitors seagrass in the lower Indian River Lagoon. Ellie Schiller Homosassa Springs Wildlife State Park, a rehabilitation facility, for the care and feeding of manatees rescued because of sickness or injury and for orphaned calves. IRL Drone monitoring project volunteers, for travel expenses related to work to better assess manatee body condition and inform rescue teams of manatees who may be in distress. Sponsor the Marine Resource’s Council Indian River Lagoon Report Card , which shares data about the state of the Indian River Lagoon with federal and Florida legislators, the public, and other entities. In cooperation with state and private partners, to fund aerial surveys of the IRL to study seagrass coverage and the health of manatee populations throughout the area. University of Florida, for research to understand if there is glyphosate interference with submerged plants and if it is contributing to manatee starvation. A 2021 UF Aquatic Animal Health study found that 55.8% of the Florida manatees tested have glyphosate in their bloodstream, which may cause organ damage and cancerous tumors. Directly and indirectly seek funds for Seagrass/Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) planting projects by our conservation partners at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the St. John’s River Water Management District, and others. SMC actively works to support additional federal and state funding for contingency planning, research, and the implementation of additional emergency holding capacity for treating sick and injured manatees, and for the staffing and equipment necessary to rescue every manatee in need. Red Tide In Florida, red tide is caused by a naturally occuring marine plankton (microscopic algae) called Karenia brevis, abbreviated K. brevis. It is found most commonly in the Gulf of Mexico. K. brevis produces several types of neurotoxins, the most impactful of which are brevetoxins. Whether they are ingested or inhaled, brevetoxins can be extremely harmful to manatees and cause seizures that lead to drowning. Read more about red tide and manatees.

(AP Photo) New York lawmakers announce bill that would help gather data on harmful algal blooms By Luke Parsnow New York State PUBLISHED 2:17 PM ET Jan. 29, 2024 PUBLISHED 2:17 PM EST Jan. 29, 2024 SHARE Two Democratic state lawmakers announced new legislation Monday aimed to help improve gathering information on harmful algal blooms (HABs) in New York's waterways. Introduced by state Sen. Rachel May and Assemblymember Anna Kelles, the Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring and Prevention (HABMAP) Act would create a centralized resource for reporting and dealing with HABs, including potential and known causes, best practice interventions, expertise and funding resources. The data would enable the state to administer a grant program supporting data-driven best practices in preventing and mitigating harmful algal blooms. HABs have recently appeared more frequently in reservoirs, lakes, ponds, and coastal areas. In 2022, there were 1,053 reported HABs in 204 water bodies across the state, according to the state Department of Environmental Conservation. HABs can impede bodies of water as a source of recreation and drinking water. âOur state's freshwater resources are the envy of the world, but they are increasingly vulnerable to pollution and the effects of a warming climate. Every season, toxic algal blooms plague many New York lakes, causing a potentially dangerous situation for residents who depend on lakes for drinking water or use them for recreation,â said Sen. May in a statement. âThe HABMAP Act will help state and local governments understand, identify, and manage threats to our water while maintaining the high quality of life that residents, employers, recreational boaters, fishing enthusiasts, and tourists from around the world have come to expect.â âLast summer, we saw the alarming rate at which Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) were affecting recreation, wildlife, and drinking water in Cayuga Lake and across the Finger Lakes Region and the State,"" Kelles said in a statement. ""This bill provides a clear mechanism to understand the causes of HABâs and start improving our water quality, enhancing recreation, wildlife habitat, and limiting harmful algal blooms. If enacted, New York will be at the forefront of producing data that can be used to offer new insights for agencies, local governments, residents, and more, to reduce polluting runoff into our lakes.â - Spectrum News Contact About RSS Sitemap FAQ ADVERTISE WITH US CAREERS TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising CERTIFICATIONS Â© 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.",29 Jan 2024 08:00:00

It is estimated about 2,700 census tracts in Michigan have some risk of HABs to humans. Photo: Michigan Sea Grant Algae are tiny, microscopic plants or cyanobacteria that live in most waterbodies, and when they grow to a size that can be seen, this is called an algal bloom. Some algal blooms contain toxins that can be harmful to animals or humans. When that occurs, it is called a harmful algal bloom or HAB. Michigan State University (MSU) Institute of Water Research , MSU Extension , and Michigan Sea Grant developed a tool ( https://bit.ly/MichiganHABs ) to identify locations where HABs in Michigan may pose the greatest risk to humans. Many factors can influence the occurrence of HABs, including land uses and nutrients entering a waterbody. Some people, such as children 5 years and younger or adults 65 years and older, or people with asthma, other underlying health conditions, or a weakened immune system may be more sensitive to the risks of HABs. Therefore, the tool spatially displays: Socioeconomic and health data from the 2022 Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy’s Environmental Justice Screening Tool; Watershed scale simulated nutrient loading of total phosphorus and nitrogen from the U.S. Geological Survey 2012 SPARROW model; and Average weekly cyanobacteria loading recorded between April 2016 and July 2022 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s CyanApp. Across the state, it is estimated there are approximately 2,700 census tracts (of varying size) with some risk of HABs to humans.

Last month, DEQ received reports of 51 algal blooms and 10 fish kills. “A large decaying red mass in the water,” three-quarters of an acre in size, near Corolla. “At least 100 catfish, floating dead,” in Jordan Lake on the north side of the U.S. 64 bridge, in Chatham County. “Dozens of dead fish, mostly catfish and striped bass, along with dozens of floating (dead) crabs and dozens of floating clams,” among the brownish pods of algal blooms, south side of Albemarle Sound, near Roper. Map: DEQ Algae are aquatic organisms that thrive in warm, sun-lit, slow-moving water. When fed by nutrients, such as fertilizer from golf course runoff or wastewater, algae form blooms, a nice word for scum. When the blooms decompose, the amount of oxygen in the water declines, suffocating the fish. Some forms of blue-green algae produce bacteria that are toxic to people and animals. (An EPA scientist once called this algae a “seven-stepper,” because after an animal drinks the contaminated water, they take seven steps and die.) It’s difficult to know whether algae is toxic merely by looking at it — the bacteria is microscopic — so avoid any water with a scum. Consistently warmer temperatures and extended summer weather, both a result of climate change, create optimal conditions for algae to multiply. In the last 12 months, there have been at 136 algal blooms and 52 fish kills, according to DEQ. In all of 2021, the public reported 90 algal blooms and 44 fish kills. (This was still during the pandemic, so fewer people could have been out and about to witness the blooms and kills.)

As the climate and bodies of water warm, they are becoming more common and more severe. And with impacts that range from foul odors to sea life die-offs, it’s worth learning how to stop contributing to toxic algal blooms, even if you live far from water. Algal blooms can be caused by cyanobacteria or true algae, including seaweed. Algae grow naturally in fresh, brackish, and salty water. But when normal environmental conditions are disrupted, they can form harmful blooms. There are well over a quarter million species of algae. Some, like the blue-green algae spirulina , are nutritious. Others, like the seaweed kelp , are keystone species in their habitats. But, toxic freshwater algae and seaweed varieties can be very harmful when they bloom. Algae do not bloom like flowers; instead, an algal bloom refers to the explosive growth of algae that forms big clumps or covers the water’s surface in slime. Like the spirulina in your green smoothie, it can also change the water’s color – this is where the phrase “ red tide ” comes from. This year, record-breaking blooms are impacting coastal ecosystems from California to Lake Erie to Florida. Although a natural phenomenon, blooms can be triggered by human activity. Algal blooms result from eutrophication when excess nutrients, particularly phosphorus, enter an aquatic system. Agricultural runoff and untreated wastewater are the primary sources of these extra nutrients, which are flushed into waterways during heavy rainfall. As climate change has resulted in warmer waters and more frequent extreme storms and flooding, algal blooms have become more common . Harmful and Toxic Algal blooms are not always toxic . Algae is naturally occurring and provides food for many species. But even beneficial algae are usually unwelcome on swimming beaches. Nontoxic algal blooms can have a slimy texture and unpleasant odor, cause water discoloration, and negatively affect the taste of water and fish. These types of blooms are called nuisance blooms . Harmful algal blooms (HAB) produce toxins or deplete oxygen, causing dead zones in the water. People and pets can become sick if exposed to toxic algal blooms, drink the water, or eat fish and shellfish caught in the affected area. Freshwater HABs can cause skin, eye, nose, throat, and lung irritation and, in some cases, stomach pain, headaches, vomiting, and liver damage, among other symptoms . HABs in salt water cause the same symptoms and can lead to various forms of shellfish poisoning that can l ead to severe illness and death . When HABs happen, closed beaches hurt local economies, and algal blooms can shut down recreational and commercial fisheries. The average annual economic impact of HABs in the U.S. is estimated at $10-100 million, and costs from a single major HAB event can reach tens of millions of dollars. Sargassum is a seaweed that grows in huge patches in the middle of the North Atlantic. But in 2011, Sargassum experienced a bloom so large that satellite images could see it, and the bloom has continued to grow ever since. Although it is critical to the open ocean ecosystem, Sargassum is a nuisance when it washes onto beaches, and it can smother coral reefs and harm other coastal ecosystems. Last year, the U.S. Virgin Islands declared a state of emergency after Sargassum clogged a desalinization plant. This year, freshwater algal blooms have caused fish kills in North Carolina and Texas and the death of a dog in Utah . A red tide growing since May in California has sickened or killed hundreds of sea mammals . Protecting Yourself While most blooms are visible from the water’s surface, not all are. And you cannot tell just by looking if a visible bloom is toxic. To protect yourself and your pets from toxic algae, paying attention to water quality advisories and signage about a bloom is essential. Stay away from the water because others may have tracked the toxins on the nearby ground. If you, your family, or pets come into contact with affected water, wash thoroughly as soon as possible. Effects of exposure to the toxins from HABs can range from mild to fatal for both people and pets, but the harm goes beyond the health impacts of direct exposure. Stopping the Bloom Wetlands absorb carbon and nutrients. They function like sponges, absorbing and storing water during heavy rainfall and releasing it during dry seasons. On coasts, wetlands reduce storm surges and floods. These characteristics give wetlands considerable potential to reduce algal growth. Protecting wetlands helps stop the increase in algal blooms and slow one of their root causes, climate change. Your actions can impact harmful algal blooms even if you don’t live near water. If you have a septic system, maintain it well. No matter your wastewater system, try to waste less water and don’t use too much laundry detergent . Design your landscape to handle stormwater runoff and reduce the chemicals you use in your yard. Use natural fertilizers , and don’t use more than the recommended amount. Even if you don’t garden, purchasing organically grown food can help eliminate fertilizer runoff. Awareness Is Key Being alert to your local water conditions and monitoring the source of fish and shellfish you eat are important steps to preventing exposure to algal blooms. The most important thing you can do to avoid HABs is to shrink your carbon footprint to reduce the pace of global warming. You can have a more direct impact by reducing the pollutants and nutrients you release into the water. Post navigation Designing Sustainable Outdoor Living Spaces Europe’s Law Will Protect Forests.

| Sacramento, CA An algal bloom appears in the San Joaquin Delta near American Legion Park in Stockton on June 2, 2022. Courtesy of Restore the Delta Outbreaks of harmful algal blooms have wreaked havoc on California river ecosystems for years. The toxic algae — a neon green layer of muck that floats atop water — thrives in warm, stagnant conditions brought on by drought. Presence of this algae can make life difficult for other plants and fish in the river, and even cause concerns for humans that accidentally ingest or possibly breathe the area around it . But this year was different. Faster, colder river waters led to fewer outbreaks of the harmful algae throughout the state. “We had this increased amount of snowpack, which is what caused a lot of flow down during the summer months,” said Spencer Fern, the Delta science program manager for the environmental nonprofit Restore the Delta. Environment California’s snowpack is double the average for May, survey finds Fern runs a program with Restore the Delta which monitors areas along the San Joaquin River by Stockton for signs of microcystis, a common type of harmful algal bloom. Despite the algae’s consistent presence in recent years, Fern said he saw no signs of it in his coverage area this summer. But the harmful algae did not disappear entirely. Officials with the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians reported a low-level presence of the algae in July by the unincorporated town of Verona, just north of Sacramento. Verona lies right next to the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather rivers and is also the site of Wóllok, a historic village for the tribe that would have been located in this vicinity. James Sarmento, the executive director for the tribe’s Cultural Resources Division, said algae’s presence caused the tribe to delay a Nisenan and Miwok language camp they’d planned at the site that month. “We were going to have lots of kids, adults and elders at this event,” he said. “I know for sure there was a concern about it.” Zach Gigone, an environmental scientist who runs the tribe’s water quality program, was hired in March as part of the tribe’s expanding efforts to address these blooms. Before he was hired, Gigone said there wasn’t any consistent monitoring of sites in the area. Now, he conducts monthly testing on sites like the river waters by Verona. “Having all this information will allow us to have a better picture of what exactly is happening and what factors are most strongly driving these algal blooms,” he said. Gigone said heavy flows brought on by last winter’s record snowpack led to fewer outbreaks of the harmful algae this year. However, he said they’ll likely return. He hopes his work will help the tribe not only identify hotspots but also offer safety guidance to tribal members. With warmer temperatures brought on by climate change, Fern said these blooms will generally become more of an issue in the future. He said it’s important for California to adapt to these conditions in order to improve the health of state rivers. “Being able to increase … cold, fresh water flow down the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers is what will hopefully prevent this harmful algal bloom problem from happening next year, which I'm crossing my fingers, but I have a feeling it'll be a drought year,” Fern said.

Search Home News News Releases Algal Bloom at Warning Level at Silverwood Lake Print Page Algal Bloom at Warning Level at Silverwood Lake Published: Aug 24, 2023 An aerial view of Silverwood Lake, a large reservoir in San Bernardino County, California on May 13, 2023. The Department of Water Resources (DWR) is urging the public to avoid contact with water at Silverwood Lake in San Bernardino County until further notice due to blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). A warning advisory was put in place today, and remains in effect for the entire lake until further notice. Boating is allowed, but swimming and other water-contact recreation and sporting activities are not considered safe due to potential adverse health effects. For more information on warning level advisory, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website under Advisory Signs. Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats, scum, or form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Do not let pets and livestock drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algae blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat shellfish from this water. F or fish caught here, throw away guts and clean fillets with tap water or bottled water before cooking. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

Over the past couple of years, Lake Superior’s warmer temperatures on the surface have also increased harmful Algal blooms. Jordan Murray, A harmful algal bloom epidemiologist with the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Wisconsin Department of Health, said the DNR is looking to prevent the spread of Cyanobacteria. “One method is to reduce the nutrients in water bodies,” Murray said. The reason why the DNR is looking to prevent Cyanobacteria is due to the the health and environmental risks. “Normally low levels of native blue green algae grow to high concentrations and blooms. And you can do this by reducing the use of phosphates containing fertilizers. You can plant natural vegetation around ponds and lakes to help filter runoff.” However, there are a lot of algae lookalikes that are mistaken for Blue Green Algae, like duckweed, or pollen. “The type of blue green algae toxin that we’re dealing with, a higher concentration could be more harmful,” Murray said. While harmful Algal Blooms have been found in Lake Superior, the concentrations did not have significant health impacts. Although Murray said, people need to be careful swimming, or boating in waters with Blue Green Algae. “If someone ingests or swallows water with toxins in it, they could experience gastrointestinal symptoms like cramps, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, things like that. And if they inhale toxins, typically we’ll see people develop symptoms that are similar to allergies or the flu.” Cyanobacteria, is not only a concern for people, but also the environment, marine life, and pets. “This year in Wisconsin, we’ve been experiencing a drought for a lot of the summer and really high temperature. So those two combined really promote the growth of cyanobacteria,” Murray said. If you have exposure to Blue Green Algae, do not hesitate to call your local health department. “We really rely on and encourage people to report blue green algae related illnesses,” Murray said. Also it’s highly recommended people report algal blooms, Blue-Green algae blooms can be reported to DNRHABS@wisconsin.gov . The report should also include the location of the bloom, the name of the water body, nearest town, county, the size and duration of the bloom, and overall and close-up photographs for verification. “We can learn more about the kinds of signs and symptoms risk factors and health outcomes associated with harmful algal bloom or blue green algae exposure,” Murray said.

They collected samples near the lake’s boat launch and the beach. The results were positive for microcystin, a toxin released by some types of cyanobacteria, often referred to as “blue-green algae”. Harmful algal bloom on Lake Cadillac in June 2023. The term HAB generally describes accumulations of cyanobacteria in amounts that are aesthetically unappealing and capable of producing toxins. While not all cyanobacteria produce toxins, significant blooms can still pose risks to human and ecosystem health. It is not possible to determine whether algal blooms contain harmful toxins by looking at them, so it is best to avoid contact with blooms or significant surface scums. Summer is peak season for the formation of HABs that can present health hazards to people and pets. In general, blooms develop when: High amounts of nutrients are in the water. Surface water conditions are calm. Water temperatures are high. Zebra or quagga mussels are present in low nutrient lakes. “While blooms sometimes do occur earlier in the spring, most of the blooms we respond to occur later in the summer,” noted Donal Brady, an environmental engineer in the Water Resources Division in EGLE’s Cadillac District Office. “Some blooms occur at surprising times, and it was surprising to see this bloom.” Two free webinars on HABs are scheduled soon: The Ohio Sea Grant will host a free public webinar from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. on June 29 that will focus on the seasonal forecast for HABs for Lake Erie this year. Registration is now open. Harmful Algal Blooms in Michigan’s Recreational Waters is a webinar hosted by EGLE and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). It is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. on July 13. Registration is now open. EGLE and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) sample for HABs on a limited basis and work with local health departments to protect the public when toxins are discovered; however, some areas affected by HABs may go undetected. Suspicious-looking algae can be reported to EGLE by calling the Environmental Assistance Center at 1-800-662-9278 or sending an e-mail to AlgaeBloom@Michigan.gov . Photographs are very helpful. Reports of cyanobacterial blooms and results of cyanotoxin testing in Michigan can now be found online at the Michigan Harmful Algal Bloom Reports map . The Michigan Harmful Algal Bloom Reports map was developed by MDHHS, in collaboration with EGLE and other stakeholders, to share available information about HABs. The Michigan Harmful Algal Bloom Reports map will be updated once per week during June through November and shows locations of bloom reports that have been verified by EGLE and results of any cyanotoxin tests conducted by EGLE, MDHHS, and partner agencies. Note that not all HABs in Michigan are reported to EGLE and so may not be included on the map. HABs can move around, disappear and reappear – meaning that HABs may be present in waterbodies, but not present on the map. Before going in any water, MDHHS recommends that you always look for and keep away from visible HABs or scums and that people and pets stay out of water in affected areas. More information about cyanobacterial blooms can be found on the EGLE HABs website which has a link to a helpful photo guide .

The state has detected red tide in Texas coastal waters for the first time since 2018. Credit: Courtesy of TPWD Sign up for The Brief , The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Toxic algae blooms known as red tide have been detected in multiple sections of the Texas Gulf Coast including the upper coast around Galveston Bay and the lower Laguna Madre in the Rio Grande Valley, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said. It’s the first time Texas has seen a red tide since 2018 , when it affected the upper and middle parts of the state’s coast. Red tide typically starts in late summer or early fall. Parks and Wildlife officials first noticed it in Freeport, south of Houston, on Sept. 3. The state agency estimates that at least two fish kills have been associated with red tide, one on Surfside-Quintana beaches near Freeport and another between Sargent Beach and Matagorda Beach last week. Red tide is caused when colonies of microalgae rapidly grow and produce toxins that can make people, fish and other sea creatures sick. When red tide algae, which occur naturally in the Gulf’s waters, reproduce in mass quantities in one location, they form “blooms,” which are visible as discolored patches of water often reddish in color. People who swim in water with a high concentration of red tide can experience eye, nose and throat irritation, as well as coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. The toxins can become airborne and people can breathe them in. Red tide also releases a toxin that can affect the central nervous system of fish, paralyzing them so they cannot breathe. This often leads to dead fish washing up on Gulf beaches — especially in Florida, where it happens nearly every summer. Red tides in Texas happen less often and don't last very long, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. TPWD said their staff is keeping an eye on the situation and working with other groups including NOAA to monitor beach conditions. Lerrin Johnson, a TPWD spokesperson, said it’s difficult to predict how long the red tide will last in Texas, adding that long periods without rainfall, like most of Texas has experienced this year, can drive algal blooms and, specifically, red tide. The agency suspects the red tide near Freeport and Galveston Bay might have caused fish to die in places like San Luis Pass and Surfside Beach and Quintana Beach. The Brazoria County parks department said staff checking beach conditions reported respiratory symptoms caused by discolored water and scattered dead fish at Quintana Beach and Follet's Island Beach. County officials are asking people to stay off beaches for safety. Red tide has also been detected in the lower Laguna Madre area at Good Hope Circle Beach and the Gulf Beach in Cameron County.

Courtesy Willie Levenson/Human Access Project The algae bloom in the Willamette River as it passes through downtown Portland continues to make the water hazardous for recreational use, and state health experts say we need cooler temperatures and possibly rain to resolve the problem. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor Algae is one of the earliest forms of life and harmful blooms have been occurring for millennia. They’re fueled by naturally occurring nutrients, like decaying vegetation and by human activity. The Oregon Health Authority says climate change is also likely increasing the frequency and duration of blooms. Oregonians were warned Monday not to swim along certain stretches of the Willamette River because of an algae bloom stretching from the Ross Island Lagoon to Cathedral Park. It’s not clear when that warning will be lifted. “The temperature is projected to decrease over the next few days. So hopefully we’ll see a reduction before too long,” said Jen Seamans, manager of the Oregon Health Authority’s Environmental Public Health Surveillance Program. “Once it rains, the increased water flow will help reduce the blooms.” Large toxic algae blooms have been occurring along the Willamette River near downtown Portland since 2015. Seamans said authorities weren’t surprised by this week’s bloom. But they were surprised by the rate at which it expanded. “It was unprecedented,” Seamans said. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor Clark County Public Health issued an algae advisory Thursday at Vancouver Lake. Another advisory remains in place at Lacamas Lake in Washington. The OHA has nine algae advisories around the state, including Cullaby Lake in Clatsop County and Galesville Reservoir in Douglas County. Oregon has no ongoing algae monitoring system. Funds haven’t been earmarked for such a system. But when blooms are observed or expected, authorities test the water and release the results. Algae testing is not cheap .But Oregon State University just announced that researchers have developed a new way to monitor harmful algae blooms by “sniffing” water for gases associated with toxins. Many of Oregon’s rivers and lakes are safe for swimming. But the OHA recommends not swimming in water that looks foamy, scummy, thick like paint, pea-green, blue-green or brownish red. A good rule of thumb is: If in doubt, stay out. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview during an algae outbreak. Harmful algae bloom along the Willamette River in downtown Portland, Aug. 16, 2023 Courtesy Willie Levenson/Human Access Project The Oregon Health Authority says symptoms from algae poisoning include headaches, cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, numbness, dizziness and fever. Children and pets are at increased risk of exposure because of their size and level of activity. Symptoms generally begin within 24 hours and last 72 hours.

                    By Murphy Woodhouse Published November 3, 2023 at 2:50 PM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 4:11 Murphy Woodhouse / Boise State Public Radio USGS employees John Carricaburu, left, and Tyler King collect water samples from Lake Lowell. Tyler King, a research hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, hopped into a truck at the agency’s Boise headquarters. The destination was Lake Lowell, a reservoir some 20 miles west. “Lake Lowell, as is common with many other water bodies in the western United States, grows an awful lot of plant matter,” he said. It can also grow cyanobacteria, one of earth’s oldest organisms and a key source of our atmosphere’s oxygen. But they can produce toxins harmful to humans and other animals, and are one type of algae that can cause harmful algal blooms – or HABs . Much monitoring is done by water managers and members of the public. That’s resource-intensive work with limited reach, as King and his coauthors noted in a paper published late last year. Thus the interest in satellites. “So, basically for the past 50 years, there have been satellites orbiting the planet, basically taking earth selfies,” King said. Murphy Woodhouse / Boise State Public Radio U.S. Geological Survey research hydrologist Tyler King was part of a team that developed a tool that uses satellites to help detect possible toxic algal blooms. Some can identify cyanobacteria and blooms in the ocean and other large water bodies. But the resolution doesn’t work well with the narrow, snaking arms of some Idaho lakes and reservoirs. Others with finer resolution can’t make those IDs. But they can spot chlorophyll, suggesting the presence of cyanobacteria – and at certain concentrations, a potentially hazardous bloom. Combing the scientific literature, King’s team found some 17 methods for extracting that information from satellite images. “And none of them worked particularly well just by themselves, so we built an ensemble out of all of them,” he said. “And that worked reasonably well to identify when you have chlorophyll greater than 10 micrograms per liter.” At that threshold, the World Health Organization says the risk rises from low to moderate, according to King. Satellite intercept High over the other side of Earth, a speeding satellite was on an intercept course with Lake Lowell. It was one of the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 polar-orbiting satellites, whose images form the core of the monitoring effort. “That's actually why we're going out here today,” King said. “We want to be on the water body at the same time that satellite image is collected.” At a boat launch, King’s colleagues Rob Florence and John Carricaburu slowly backed a simple, aluminum boat into the water. Before the boat even got underway, troubling signs were already clear from the deck. “You see these clumps of clumps of algae here?” King said, pointing out a swarm of green, bunched-together particles. “It looks like a cyanobacteria.” Murphy Woodhouse / Boise State Public Radio USGS employees John Carricaburu, at the helm, and Rob Florence speed across Lake Lowell in southwest Idaho. At the first stop, Rob and his colleagues break out the gear. “This is a water quality sonde,” Florence explained. “I'm gonna drop this in the water, and it tells us all sorts of things: it tells us water temperature …, pH, dissolved oxygen, a bunch of water quality parameters.” They also gather lake water to test for chlorophyll concentration, and churn it for uniform sampling. “After the fact, we will take the field data and we'll match it up with the satellite based products…to quantify how accurate they are,” King said. “And then eventually to improve the next generation of remotely sensed products.” Murphy Woodhouse / Boise State Public Radio Rob Florence gets ready to drop the anchor at a sampling site on Lake Lowell. One task remained at the first stop: snapping a photo with a highly specialized camera. “And right now there's a cloud in the way,” he said. “So we'll wait for that to move out of the way so we can get similar illumination conditions to the satellite.” Game changer Every five or so days, updated maps are uploaded to the public web application known as REACT , or the remote aquatic chlorophyll tracker. Some Idaho water managers are intrigued by its potential to save time and resources monitoring. The work typically involved in sampling is “very time-intensive,” said Elizabeth Spelsberg, a senior water quality standards scientist at the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. The satellite tool is “new enough that we haven't really started to utilize it yet, but it might really help in narrowing down locations for us to go sample,” she said. King said that the tool is currently calibrated for Idaho water bodies. Murphy Woodhouse / Boise State Public Radio Before heading back to Boise, Tyler King snagged a water sample full of what he thought could be cyanobacteria with his personal water bottle. “And as a scientist, you don't like to apply models outside of the bounds where they were developed,” he said. “But with validation data, on the ground observations, this product could be applied essentially globally.” Even in its current state, it’s being used elsewhere in the West. “It’s really been a game-changer these last few years,” said Kurt Carpenter, a fellow research hydrologist for the geological survey in Portland. “Having the application calibrated for more areas could be helpful,” he added. “But there's really no reason to believe that the algorithm that was developed for Idaho here, that it wouldn't hold in other places. I mean, it seems to be working beautifully in Oregon.” He said it’s helped him in his own research, and has allowed him and his colleagues to more efficiently choose sampling sites. Let the sun shine Back on the boat, the sun was starting to peek through. Florence readied the camera and King was set to take notes. “We’re going to have a short window here, shall we?” King said. “Let’s do it,” Florence responded. The single-pixel device is capable of capturing dozens of wavelengths of light. It’s used to check images from the satellite and account for the impact of miles of atmosphere, according to King. “And that’s everything,” Florence said, after snagging a few more images. Data collected, the crew stowed the gear, and Carricaburu sped the boat toward the next site.

The toxic menace has become a summer ritual that lingers into fall and even winter — not just in Utah, but nationwide. No state has been spared. Noxious blooms return to the same lakes and reservoirs, creeks and streams, stock water ponds and stormwater pools year after year, many producing toxins that can suck the life out of sensitive ecosystems, sicken people and prove fatal to pets who come into contact with infected water or brush against dried blooms on the shoreline. A beloved family pet died over Labor Day weekend after being exposed to harmful algae in Utah Lake . And three weeks before, another dog died and three others were sickened by toxic algae in the Virgin River. What will it take to finally heal this national epidemic? What we are doing now is not working. Efforts at the federal level fall woefully short. A new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analysis reports 368 harmful algal blooms resulted in 117 human illnesses and at least 2,715 animal illnesses in 2021. This analysis grossly understates the magnitude of the problem because reporting is only voluntary. Utah is one of only 16 states to report outbreaks and illnesses to the CDC. Without mandatory reporting, we will not come close to fully grasping the consequences of harmful algae. A Government Accountability Office study of federal efforts to manage toxic blooms provides additional cause for concern. Twenty-five years after Congress directed NOAA and EPA to develop a comprehensive, coordinated national program on harmful algal blooms, we still do not have one. For the most part, this toxic plague is left to states to address. Related The summer heat is on and so is Utah’s harmful algae season The myth of the irreparable Utah Lake It is time for a new strategy. We must put more resources into prevention. Congress should consider legislation to better manage nonpoint source pollution . Farmers can reduce their use of fertilizer and create buffers to absorb nutrients and reduce runoff. More states can adopt fertilizer application standards and strengthen manure regulations. And municipalities can update wastewater treatment facilities to ensure pollutants are not being discharged into area waterways. The war on algal blooms in Utah is being waged on many fronts. Utah is among the states that carry out routine sampling of recreational water bodies. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality provides an interactive map pinpointing advisories, and a reporting hotline for the public when blooms are spotted. The Utah Department of Agriculture has a response plan to help farmers and ranchers mitigate blooms, and the state has established a technology-based limit for phosphorus to help reduce point-source runoff. The fact that toxic blooms return year after year — and often linger longer — underscores the difficult task state and local leaders face. And while early treatment is the key to reducing the intensity of repeat blooms, mitigation measures often tap into already tight finances. One newer solution that’s gaining attention is the use of environmental impact financing, which funds the cleanup of an algae-infested water body via the sale of impact credits. The harmful algal bloom is remediated at no cost to the local governing body, while companies interested in offsetting their impact on the environment, such as their carbon footprint, purchase credits to fund the project. The body of water’s health is restored — without costing taxpayers a dime. We need more of these kinds of creative solutions to address this growing problem. All states should have a comprehensive harmful algal bloom program in place. Routine monitoring and tracking should be mandated, not simply recommended. States should establish monitoring guidelines and cyanotoxin threshold levels for public water systems, flag water bodies that do not meet quality standards, and set daily caps on nutrient-related pollutants. Agencies in charge of tracking outbreaks need more funding and additional resources. Utah is home to iconic national parks, stunning red rock landscapes and pristine lakes fed by freshwater springs and snowmelt. We must cherish and protect these natural treasures. By focusing on aggressive early treatment and prevention, we can break toxic algae’s menacing cycle once and for all.

In a new podcast from OPB and ProPublica, follow the fight to save them through the voices of one Yakama Nation family. Listen now High temperatures send Oregonians to cool water, but state warns of toxic algae blooms By Kristian Foden-Vencil ( OPB ) Aug. 14, 2023 9:32 p.m. As Oregon temperatures reach triple digits, the Oregon Health Authority is warning people not to jump into rivers and lakes with toxic algae blooms. Cyanobacteria are blooming in nine Oregon bodies of water , from Hells Canyon Reservoir to Upper Klamath Lake and the South Umpqua River. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor In Portland, the Oregon Health Authority has placed advisories on the Willamette River near Ross Island Lagoo and Riverplace Marina. On Monday, it also extended an advisory at Willamette Cove downstream to near Cathedral Park. Essentially, the advisory covers much of downtown. Cyanobacteria are found in fresh and salt water all over the world. The bacteria can be beneficial by producing oxygen, but in warm weather, low water flows can lead to blooms that produce large amounts of cyanotoxins. Kylah Peterson cools off on the Willamette River on Monday, Aug. 14, 2023. The Oregon Health Authority has issued several warnings for toxic algae blooms in waterways across the state as temperatures reached into the triple digits. Kristian Foden-Vencil / OPB Kylah Peterson, a 26-year-old Portland resident, doesn’t have air conditioning, so she uses fans and window curtains to stay cool. On Monday, she visited Sellwood Park to dip her feet in the Willamette River, not far from one advisory area. “It’s definitely something to be concerned about,” Peterson said. “But I’m being very cautious and just keeping my feet in.” As a veterinary assistant, Peterson was also keeping an eye out for dogs running in and out of the river. Dogs and other animals, including cats, horses, birds and humans, are susceptible to cyanotoxins. They can enter the body when contaminated water is ingested. The toxins can cause symptoms ranging from skin irritation to liver and kidney damage. Symptoms generally begin within 24 hours and last 72 hours. For pets, they can sometimes be fatal. THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor The number of algae blooms in Oregon has increased over the last decade. Peterson blamed the rise in temperatures resulting from human-caused climate change. “It kind of makes me sad because I’ve lived here for a while and these heat waves weren’t what I grew up with. It does seem like climate change is happening,” she said. “I kind of miss how it was, but we’ve got to move forward and this is how it is now.” Willie Levenson, head of the Human Access Project , a nonprofit dedicated to getting more people to swim in the Willamette River, agrees that climate change has increased local algae blooms. But, he said, things can be done to reduce the number of blooms. For example, Ross Island Lagoon sits on an island. It’s where Ross Island Sand and Gravel have dug aggregate for concrete for 100 years. As a result, there’s a pool 130 feet deep, where water from the Willamette River backwaters sits and warms, causing an algae bloom. Levenson and his group are trying to secure federal funding so they can pay to dig a channel that would move more river water through the lagoon, cooling the water and reducing algae blooms. “The harmful algae bloom forms inside of the lagoon and then winds and tides blow it out into the channel. Then it migrates into the mainstem of the river,” Levenson said. Levenson said the Willamette River should be viewed as a natural cooling station that people need when temperatures rise, rather than a potential threat to their health. For anyone visiting the water in this week’s heat, they should take cyanobacteria seriously, he said. “Harmful algae bloom is a very serious issue. I mean it’s probably the biggest issue in Portland that people aren’t aware of.” When he swims, which is about four times a week, Levenson makes sure the water is moving relatively quickly, and that there are no green flecks floating on the surface.

                    By Sara McGiff Published October 31, 2023 at 3:43 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Listen • 1:13 Sara McGiff / WSHU Stony Brook University ecologist Chris Gobler completed his 2023 Assessment of Water Quality Impairments for Long Island. A new type of harmful algal bloom was found this past summer in Long Island waters. It spanned from the middle of the Great South Bay to the edge of the Shinnecock Bay — posing a potential public health risk for Long Island residents who eat shellfish or swim in those waters. A 2023 Assessment of Water Quality Impairments for Long Island released Tuesday found more dead zones, toxic tides, fish kills and a record-setting season for harmful algal blooms this past summer. The demarcation line, where the new type of algal bloom flourished from August to October, began in communities home to aged septic and sewer systems. “All of these occurrences, the blue green algal blooms, the marine toxic algal blooms, are in near shore areas that are getting heavy loads of nutrients — specifically nitrogen, and specifically nitrogen from septic systems,” said Chris Gobler, the report’s author and a coastal ecologist and conservationist at Stony Brook University. The new type of harmful algal bloom is known as Pseudo-nitzschia . This bloom is particularly harmful to humans because it produces domoic acid which kills off synapses and neurons in the brain. “This harmful algal bloom has a global distribution,” Gobler said. “It’s very common on the West Coast, its been seen before on the Northeast, but it's never been seen before in New York.” Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Suffolk County Legislature voted to backburner a hearing on the Clean Water Act , preventing it from being included on the November ballot for a vote. Their reasoning varied, but the common concern was that the revenue raised by an eighth of a cent tax wasn’t evenly split between advanced septic systems and sewer projects. To Adrienne Esposito, the executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment, this decision has come at a cost to Long Island waterways. “As scientists and environmentalists sound the alarm, the Suffolk Legislature keeps hitting the snooze button,” Esposito said. “As they gleefully sleep, the water crisis is getting worse and continues.” The algal blooms are accelerating due to the Old New Inlet closing naturally this year. The inlet was opened after Superstorm Sandy in 2012. Water from the Atlantic Ocean was able to flush out nitrogen pollution through Bellport and Moriches bays. Sand eventually filled up the inlet this year after a decade of the inlet acting as a natural filter. “And that’s not going to reopen,” Gobler said. “We’re back to the pre-Sandy reality of just having the Moriches Inlet and the Fire Island Inlet and so it’s going to leave us vulnerable to further water quality impairments like this event.” Tags Long Island News Water quality Algal Blooms Stony Brook University Long Island sewers Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Sara McGiff Sara McGiff is a news intern at WSHU for the fall of 2023.

Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Photo courtesy of Finn Ryan of yaharaproject.org Blue-green algae blooms on large, shallow and nutrient-rich lakes may be related to ongoing drought conditions in Wisconsin this summer. The state has already received at least 93 algal bloom reports so far this year compared to 69 reports at the end of July last year. That’s according to figures provided by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. The agency said the increase in reports this year is likely due to sightings of pollen and filamentous green algae that looks like long green hairs growing in the water. The latter can form floating green mats that turn brown and become smelly as they break down. About half the blooms reported so far — 48 — have been identified as cyanobacterial blooms. Cyanobacteria, often referred to as blue-green algae, has the ability to produce toxins that can make people or their pets sick. Stay informed on the latest news Sign up for WPR’s email newsletter. Email Phone This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged. Gina LaLiberte, the agency’s harmful algal bloom coordinator, said it’s possible drainage lakes may see more drought-related effects on water quality because rivers typically flow into them. She said conditions may begin to stagnate in those lakes if there’s not as much water moving through them due to a lack of rain. “The water gets really warm, the nutrients aren’t moving through, so that’s where you might be seeing more issues with cyanobacterial blooms,” LaLiberte said. LaLiberte said she’s received reports and photos confirming blue-green algae blooms on large and shallow drainage lakes like Lake Winnebago and Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Blue-green algae issues have surfaced over the years on Lake Petenwell in central Wisconsin. Photo courtesy of Rhonda Cain-Carrell Despite the presence of blue-green algae, Rick Georgeson who lives and sails on Lake Petenwell said water conditions appear much better than years past. He attributes improvements in water quality to the efforts of producer-led groups that have formed in the Wisconsin River watershed. “These farmers are making some huge changes in the way they farm,” Georgeson said. “Cover crop and no till planting seems to be making a huge difference in what we’ve seen.” Satellite data has also detected cyanobacterial blooms on Lakes Petenwell and Castle Rock, as well as the Chetek Chain of Lakes in northwestern Wisconsin. The Chetek Lakes Protection Association represents around 500 property owners on the chain’s six lakes, which see around 40,000 visitors each summer. That’s according to Jamey Lideen, president of the association. Lideen said he’s unaware of any blue-green algae blooms and hasn’t observed any changes under drought conditions this year. Although, he said blooms often form in shallow bays on the lakes with low water flows after the July 4th holiday. “It’s very typical later in the summer that people in these small bays smell the decaying algae or see a buildup of it in those areas,” Lideen said, noting decaying duckweed is often mistaken for blue-green algae. LaLiberte said she hasn’t received any bloom reports from the Chetek Chain of Lakes, but state health officials received a question from a resident about the safety of water on the chain’s Prairie Lake. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services has received and investigated at least 14 reports of illnesses in animals and humans that were suspected to stem from blue-green algae exposure. Of those, only three were potentially related to blue-green algae. “Symptoms associated with these cases have included things like fever, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash,” Jordan Murray, harmful algal bloom epidemiologist for DHS, said. “We had one dog illness so far, and symptoms with the dog included things like lethargy, seizure-like symptoms and vomiting as well.” A large cyanobacteria bloom on Lake Monona in Madison on June 29, 2019. Cyanobacteria has been present in Lake Monona almost all of June. Finn Ryan/ yaharaproject.org State health officials typically receive an average of 25 reports each year when blooms are most likely to form between May through September. “With the sort of drought conditions that we’ve been experiencing, hot weather, lack of rain creates these prime conditions for blooms to grow and to be produced,” Murray said. “With that being said, it’s possible that we get more illness reports throughout the end of the month and then into August as well.” Kids are especially susceptible to exposure. Murray said people can keep their kids and pets safe by steering clear of water that resembles green paint or pea soup. She also advised parents to remind their children not to swallow water while swimming. Ingesting water is the primary way that people can get sick, but people can also come into contact with blue-green algae toxins on their skin or by breathing in water droplets. For animals, health officials recommend giving their dogs breaks from swimming and rinsing them off after any potential exposure. As for the Great Lakes, the DNR’s LaLiberte said there have been no reports of blooms on the open waters of Lake Michigan or Lake Superior. Although mats of blue-green algae were found attached to the sediment of Barker’s Island beach in Superior on July 12 and 13. A short-lived blue-green algae bloom was spotted on Friday, Sept. 10, 2021, at the Barker’s Island beach area in Superior. Photo courtesy of Hannah Ramage with the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve Kait Reinl, a researcher at the Lake Superior National Estuarine Research Reserve, said the mats contained two species of blue-green algae that have the potential to produce toxins. “But we don’t have any evidence that any toxins were actually being produced,” Reinl said. Toxic blue-green algae was found for the first time two years ago in the inlet of Lake Superior. It was a concerning discovery in the progression of blooms observed on the lake. The first documented blue-green algae bloom on Lake Superior formed in 2012 after massive flooding in the region. That was followed by another large bloom in 2018 that stretched about 50 miles along the lake’s shore. Researchers are keeping a close eye on blooms as climate change drives temperatures higher, warms lakes and causes more extreme weather events that set the stage for harmful algal blooms. State regulators and researchers urge people to report any blooms or illnesses .

Credit: Callie Rhoades A red substance was visible in the water between the Lake Merritt Sailboat House and the Rotary Nature Center on March 7, alarming people involved in looking after the lagoon’s health. The substance, still yet to be identified, has sparked anxiety around another potential harmful algal bloom that can kill aquatic animals in huge numbers. In August of 2022, a harmful algal bloom swept through Lake Merritt and parts of San Francisco Bay. Harmful algal blooms, often referred to as HABs, occur when certain algae grow suddenly and excessively in a body of water. These harmful blooms can release toxins, clog bodies of water, and significantly reduce the oxygen in the water. The algae that spread in the Bay Area and lake two years ago was a species called Heterosigma akashiwo , an introduced marine algae commonly associated with red-colored tides. It is believed to have caused a massive fish kill, mainly by pulling oxygen out of the water and suffocating everything from fish to clams. Update: harmful algae detected in Lake Water samples tested by the California Department of Public Health and San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board on Mar. 8 confirmed trace levels of a microorganism that can cause harm to marine life. James Robinson, Executive Director of the Lake Merritt Institute, said the red water in the lagoon yesterday looked very concerning and he immediately called the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Control Board to report it. “It’s heart-wrenching. You don’t want another event like 2022. It’s still fresh,” said Robinson. Confusion among lake stewards grew throughout the day about what was causing the red color in the water. There were reports of some kind of red sediment being released from a nearby storm drain and some speculated that it might have caused the discoloration, not an algae. Katie Noonan, founder of Rotary Nature Center Friends , frequently conducts water quality samples at Lake Merritt for the water control board and has partnered with them to monitor for potentially harmful kinds of algae. Once the report came to the control board, Noonan was asked to collect a sample of water for them. Noonan and another member of Rotary Nature Center Friends, Janai Southworth, went out to the lake with a microscope and a plankton collection net. What they saw under the microscope was several types of plankton, most notably they identified a significant presence of a species of plankton, mesodinium rubrum , which has been linked to other “red tides.” Not necessarily a harmful algal bloom The term “red tide” refers to any phytoplankton bloom that causes red discoloration in marine waters, and these are not always harmful events. Certain phytoplankton contain a specific type of pigment that allows them to photosynthesize. According to the California Department of Public Health, “In California, the majority of red tides are not caused by species that produce deadly toxins.” Many red tides also don’t result in deoxygenation of water. “In people’s minds they see red water and they freak out but in fact there are many kinds of plankton blooms and mix blooms that can make the water red that are not producing poisons, so that’s something we can all learn from this episode,” said Noonan.

Credit: Courtesy of Janai Southworth While those present for this initial sampling did not discover any evidence of the type of plankton that caused the previous toxic algal bloom, further lab testing is still needed to be certain of the results. Lake water samples were sent to labs contracted by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Control Board as well as the California Department of Public Health. According to a representative from the control board, results from official testing could come in as early as this weekend. Eli Kersh, president of LakeTech , a water quality monitoring company that has anchored censors in Lake Merritt, said it’s very unusual that a red tide would occur in March. Red tides usually occur in warmer water which is typical in the summer or fall. However, there has been recent research that suggests these blooms can handle colder temperatures in some situations. Despite initial skepticism, when Kersh and his team went out to the lake yesterday to get a visual on the water, they noticed what appeared to be tendrils of red algae present throughout the lake. Noonan accompanied Kersh out on the lake but said it was difficult to track the discoloration due to fast-moving currents. Officials from the Oakland’s Public Works Department were also dispatched to investigate the concerns. According to city spokesperson Jean Walsh, “OPW staff was dispatched to observe conditions and can confirm the presence of discoloration in the Lake. We are investigating this further to identify the cause of the discoloration and determine next steps.” Climate change could lead to more harmful algal blooms Algal blooms, like the one that occurred in 2022, are of growing concern to scientists across the country. Warming temperatures as a result of climate change are increasing the likelihood of harmful blooms. These blooms not only create toxins that can kill fish and other animals, they can also affect people. Increased frequency of HABs can result in the need for more frequent drinking water treatment and thus a reduced quantity of drinking water. They can also cause respiratory issues for high-risk individuals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has monitoring systems in place to track the presence of HABs across the U.S. After the 2022 algal bloom at Lake Merritt, the city of Oakland, launched the Lake Merritt Water Quality Management Pilot Project to monitor and improve the lagoon’s water quality. LakeTech, is one of the partners on this project . The stations around the lake update a dashboard in real-time and monitor water temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen levels, and chlorophyll, which is associated with algal blooms. Kersh said their monitors may catch an algal bloom if it was widespread and present at their monitoring stations, but it would depend on several factors including the type of algae. The city has also installed devices to increase dissolved oxygen levels in small areas of the lake. The pilot program’s initial planning and monitoring is currently funded up until June of 2025. While the investigation into the official cause of the discoloration is ongoing, Noonan said that this does present an opportunity for officials and community members to understand the complexity of the lake’s ecosystem. “I think what this really points out is how complex the system is and how important Lake Merritt is and how important it is to understand what’s going on in the Lake and in the wider bay,” said Noonan.

Wyoming Public Radio | 
                    By Caitlin Tan Published August 28, 2023 at 11:42 AM MDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Flipboard Greg Allen / NPR The blue-green algae is called cyanobacteria. It can release toxins that affect the liver and nervous system. Seemingly more bodies of water in Wyoming are being affected by harmful algal blooms, but some experts say that might not be the case. Harmful Cyanobacteria Blooms (HCB’s) can look like grass clippings, blue-green scum or spilled paint on water. They’re actually naturally occurring, but in higher levels can be toxic to humans and animals. As of the end of August, 36 bodies of water in the state have blooms, and while only some have recreational advisories, it’s recommended to be cautious around any bloom. In 2018, there were only 12 . But, Kelsee Hurshman, HCB coordinator for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), said they aren’t necessarily increasing. “I think the increase of advisories comes with more frequent monitoring as well as more public awareness,” she said. Basically, the agency is getting better at detecting the blooms. But, some other experts say it is possible these blooms are increasing around the globe and it’s partly linked to warming temperatures. “That is a big factor. These cyanobacteria have a higher temperature optimum, oftentimes the hotter the better for them,” said West Bishop, algae scientist and water quality research manager at SePRO Corporation, a for-profit national group that works in plant and water management. Bishop said nutrients produced in warmer weather could be helping HCB’s thrive. Notably, Hurshman with the DEQ, cited research that indicates climate change might not be affecting HCB’s in Wyoming’s water as much as some think. The results showed that in the past 36 years very few lakes in Wyoming have gone through eutrophication, which is when there’s a high concentration of nutrients that HCB’s can thrive in. Regardless, late summer and early fall are peak times for HCB’s. Be aware of recreational advisory around bodies of water – you can find them here . If water is ingested it can be toxic.

(Beth LaBerge/KQED) A red tide that has left a light-brown sheen on the water along parts of the East Bay shoreline is the same type of toxic algae bloom that killed thousands of fish in the San Francisco Bay last summer, a local environmental group warned on Monday. “We have confirmed with our partners that it’s the same species as last year,” Eileen White, executive officer of the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board , said at a Monday afternoon press conference. She said the organism has so far been found in the bay waters near Emeryville, Albany, the Berkeley Marina, Richardson Bay and Belvedere Cove, as well as off the Marin County coast, near Muir Beach. “The good news is we have not seen any marine animal deaths as a result of this algae bloom,” she said. San Francisco Baykeeper ’s pollution hotline lit up late last week with calls about the tea-colored water seen stretching from Emeryville to Albany, said Jon Rosenfield, the group’s senior scientist. “Two years in a row is quite alarming,” he said, noting that it remained unclear how bad the bloom will get. “There’s really nothing that people can do to stop a bloom like this once it’s started. It just has to burn itself out.” Red tides are fueled by elevated levels of nitrogen and phosphorus expelled into the water as a byproduct of treated sewage from wastewater treatment plants — leaving nutrients that algae love to nibble on. Such conditions can cause the algae to grow out of control and sometimes form a rust-colored hue. Reddish-brown water due to an algae bloom can be seen in the Berkeley Marina on July 31, 2023. (Beth LaBerge/KQED) Not every algal bloom is harmful, some can even be beneficial to marine habitats. But others produce deadly blooms — as did the one that emerged last August .  That algae species, identified as Heterosigma akashiwo , and also believed to be the cause of the current bloom, killed an untold number fish over a matter of weeks, their rotting, fetid carcasses littered across Bay Area shorelines, including the banks of Lake Merritt. The algae species emits a toxin that’s especially harmful to fish. It can also spur a biological reaction that depletes oxygen levels in the water, acerbating the marine death toll. Sponsored David Senn, a senior scientist at the San Francisco Estuary Institute, said that while it’s too soon to tell, the current bloom may be the result of algae from last year that lay dormant in sediment over the winter. “It’s not all that surprising that we’re seeing a reemergence of this again this summer,” said Senn, whose group is using satellite imagery to track the bloom in real time. Rosenfield, with SF Baykeeper, blames this and other recent harmful algal blooms on the region’s 37 wastewater plants that regularly discharge treated sewage into the bay. He said the regional water board has an opportunity next year to change permitting rules — when permits go up for renewal — to clamp down on the nutrient load the plants are allowed to release. “San Francisco Bay has some of the highest levels of nutrient pollution of any estuary in the world,” he said. “The solution is to remove the fuel load, which means keeping those nutrients out of the bay waters . ” Although local wastewater treatment plants remove sewage, most do not filter out all the nutrients before discharging water back into the bay. Fixing the problem could cost at least $12 billion and maybe twice that much, according to Bay Area Clean Water Agencies, which represent local water districts. More on red tides White, with the regional water board, said some local wastewater plants are already redesigning their facilities to reduce the amount of nutrients released into the bay. But she said the push is not uniform and, although it could ramp up next year, there is currently no formal requirement for plant operators to reduce the nutrient loads that are discharged. “Some of the wastewater agencies have already started planning, but knowing that it’s not like switching on a light switch, it’s going to take time to plan, design and construct,” said White, who formerly served as East Bay Municipal Utility District’s wastewater director. Scientists also say red tides are likely to occur more often as the climate warms and raises water temperatures. High nutrient loads and warming water is “like a one-two punch, and we really need to tackle both of the problems,” said Emily Jeffers, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “But the one that we can address more readily and more quickly is the nutrient loads from the wastewater-treatment facilities.” Jeffers said she learned about the current algal bloom from her 8-year-old daughter, who attended summer camp at the Berkeley Marina last week. “She said some kids might go in the water and that she didn’t think that was a good idea,” Jeffers said of her daughter. “I told her that was smart.” lower waypoint KQED Get the best of KQED’s science coverage in your inbox weekly.

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work. Oh, that works really well,’” Mitchell said. “I want to laud them for trying it first.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n"",""blocks"":[],""excerpt"":""Following Gov.

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work.

In the San Francisco Bay Area, PREP Wellness, in partnership with UCSF, provides diagnosis and treatment to young people with mental health problems. That belief gives rise to a new treatment approach using computer games to target nuts-and-bolts brain functions such as memory and comprehension. The second story in the series, “What Is Schizophrenia?” (8/4/14) begins at a clinical trial for one such game, where one participant drifts subtly in and out of delusion. “Would you like to see voices too?” he asks. For a generation of neuroscience-oriented researchers, those kinds of delusions have been viewed as the meaningless (and usually harmful) byproducts of a diseased brain, something to be eradicated with anti-psychotic drugs. Now that notion is being questioned too. Listening to the Voices For some people living with schizophrenia, voices and delusions may not be the most problematic symptom, researchers told us. Some patients may actually benefit from paying attention to the content of their voices, possibly transforming them into an experience that is benign or even helpful. We explore that idea in our third radio story, “What It’s Like to Hear Voices” (8/11/14). Online, we hear from voice-hearers about the complex relationships they've developed with their delusions and hallucinations. We meet one young man whose voices taunted and isolated him for years. But now that they’re mostly gone, he says he sometimes misses them. Versions of these stories are scheduled to air nationally on Morning Edition, beginning September 15. We’ll post the links as soon as they become available."",""ogTitle"":null,""ogDescription"":null,""ogImgId"":null,""twTitle"":null,""twDescription"":null,""twImgId"":null},""ttid"":1811,""isLoading"":false,""link"":""/science/series/schizophrenia-new-thinking-new-treatments""},""science_46"":{""type"":""terms"",""id"":""science_46"",""meta"":{""index"":""terms_1591234321"",""site"":""science"",""id"":""46"",""found"":true},""relationships"":{},""included"":{},""name"":""Audio"",""slug"":""audio"",""taxonomy"":""category"",""description"":null,""featImg"":null,""headData"":{""title"":""Audio

Saros 1 1 School of Biology & Ecology and Climate Change Institute, University of Maine, Orono, ME U.S.A. 04469 2 National Park Service, Acadia National Park, Bar Harbor, ME U.S.A. 04609 Abstract Toxin-producing cyanobacteria can form HABs in lakes, leading to unfavorable impacts on drinking water, recreation, tourism, and ecosystem structure and function. Lakes in ANP have excellent water quality, but in the last decade several Maine lakes have experienced unprecedented and costly HABs, as have lakes in other National Park Service (NPS) units. To assess early warning signs in lakes varying in trophic status and other water quality parameters, we sampled Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch Hole Pond in 2020. We 1) instrumented each lake with temperature and dissolved oxygen sensors for high-resolution data; 2) performed biweekly water column sampling; 3) tracked phycocyanin (an indicator of cyanobacteria) concentration; 4) prepared bathymetric maps of each lake; 5) collected meteorological data; and 6) assessed long-term monitoring data collected by the ANP Air & Water Quality Program. We prepared an assessment of each lake type that evaluated risk conditions including temperature, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a (chl a ) and phycocyanin concentration, and nutrient levels. We also considered how the effects of lake morphometry could affect susceptibility to HABs. Shallow, eutrophic lakes like Witch Hole Pond could be more vulnerable to HAB formation due to high surface and water column temperature, low dissolved oxygen, high nutrients, and greater relative concentrations of chl a and phycocyanin. Jordan Pond, a deep oligotrophic lake, did not exhibit early warning signs of HABs, and we expect that similar lakes in ANP are equally resistant to HAB conditions. Building on these findings, we developed a scorecard to assess the individual risk of all ANP lakes to future HAB formation. To develop this risk assessment scorecard, we included parameters with known values for lakes in ANP that have been shown to affect vulnerability to HABs, such as trophic status, flushing rate, maximum depth, stratification, and level of protection within the ANP boundary. We weighted the parameters based on their relative importance in HAB development, then categorized the resulting ranks into risk levels of “low,” “moderate,” and “considerable.” Four of the 6 lakes that serve as drinking water supplies were in the low-risk category, while 2 drinking water lakes were at moderate risk. The risk assessment scorecard supports our findings that lakes like Jordan Pond have the fewest risk factors to future HAB development, while lakes like Witch Hole Pond have more risk factors and may be more vulnerable to developing HABs in the future. Based on the ranking of lakes on the Risk Assessment Scorecard, we suggest integrating sustainable, easily repeatable, and easy-to-implement steps into the current Air & Water monitoring program. We make recommendations about phycocyanin monitoring, winter sampling, and eDNA identification of cyanobacterial taxa, as well as the types of lakes in which to prioritize these data collection efforts. Educational outreach and citizen science will be important venues for public awareness and support. Together these efforts will help protect water quality and safeguard visitors and those who rely on ANP lakes as drinking water sources. Introduction Globally, harmful algal blooms (HABs) are increasing rapidly in inland waters (Watson et al. 2015). HABs cause unfavorable and costly impacts to drinking water resources, tourism and recreation, property values, and ecosystem structure and function (Watson et al. 2015). Lake scientists and resource managers in federal and state agencies in Maine are concerned about the vulnerability of lakes to cyanobacterial HABs, which develop when cyanobacteria are present in lake water and produce toxins. The toxins may reach sufficient concentrations to harm humans, livestock, and pets who come into contact with the water. Some common toxin-producing, bloom-forming cyanobacteria occurring in Maine lakes are Dolichospermum (formerly Anabaena ), Aphanizomenon , Gloeotrichia, Microcystis, and Oscillatoria (Carey et al. 2012b; Bacon 2016). These taxa can produce hepatotoxins and neurotoxins, and can cause irritation of mucous membranes in exposed individuals (Watson et al. 2015). Algal blooms can also cause taste and odor issues in drinking water sources. The WHO, CDC, and EPA describe HABs as an emerging public health issue and major environmental concern (Chorus & Welker 2021; CDC 2023; U.S. EPA 2023b). In Maine and the rest of the northeast U.S., microcystin-LR is one of the most common and harmful toxins occurring in cyanobacterial HABs, and concentrations of microcystin-LR exceeded EPA and WHO drinking water standards in a subset of Maine lakes in 2009 (Bacon 2016). In recent years, several Maine lakes experienced unprecedented and unexpected cyanobacterial HABs (Wight 2019). Some of these lakes serve as drinking water sources, and required costly treatment plans to protect the public (Kidd 2019). National Parks in the Great Lakes region (Isle Royale, Pictured Rocks, and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore) support ongoing research projects to study HABs and cyanotoxins in water resources (National Park Service (NPS) 2018). These parks receive approximately 1.6 million visitors annually, less than half of the 3.9 million visitors to Acadia National Park (ANP) in 2022 (Gibson 2023). In ANP, lakes are treasured for their aesthetic, recreational, educational, and scientific value, and six lakes in ANP watersheds are part of three municipal water systems. ANP lakes have excellent water quality, but when water quality issues develop, they typically occur quickly and across many lakes (Wight 2019). Scientific consensus suggests that HABs are increasing worldwide (Heisler et al. 2008; Ho & Michalak 2017), and that with ongoing changes in climate, HABs will continue to become more frequent (Kudela et al. 2015; Michalak 2016; Carpenter & Pace 2018). Northern lakes (>45° N ANP is located at 44.3°N) are expected to undergo the greatest rates of change (Creed et al. 2018), with increasing temperatures and more frequent and severe precipitation events (Hanson et al. 2006; Kirtman et al. 2013). Lakes sequester natural and anthropogenic airshed and watershed nutrient inputs mediated by climate, hydrology, geography, and geology, and site-specific vulnerability to HABs is determined by physical, chemical, and biological lake characteristics (Paerl et al. 2018). Multiple internal and external factors can promote or suppress freshwater blooms, complicating predictions about HAB formation, especially in lakes with unknown bloom thresholds (Buelo et al. 2018). Lake water temperature closely follows air temperature, and over the last century, air temperature across Maine has increased 3°F (Fernandez et al. 2015). This widespread increase in temperature might encourage bloom conditions for several reasons. Cyanobacteria can outcompete other algal groups in warm water (Weyhenmeyer 2001; Paerl & Huisman 2008), and warmer surface waters can increase thermal vertical stratification, which may favor toxic cyanobacteria taxa that are able to control buoyancy, like Dolichospermum and Microcystis (Gobler et al. 2007; Watson et al. 2015; Lofton et al. 2020). Warm water holds less dissolved oxygen than cold water, and lakes trending toward warmer water with lower dissolved oxygen may be at higher risk of HAB formation (U.S. EPA 2019a). Oxygen is consumed when cyanobacterial biomass decays at the conclusion of a bloom, which may lead to bottom-water anoxia (Paerl et al. 2001) and trigger release of sedimentary P in some lakes (Trimbee & Prepas 1988). Shifts in winter temperature patterns affect the timing of ice-off and the length of the growing season (Wiedner et al. 2007; Deng et al. 2014; Watson et al. 2015). Maine lakes are sensitive to high winter and spring temperatures, and exhibit temporal synchrony of ice-off (Beyene & Jain 2015; Boeff et al. 2016), a pattern also documented in other boreal lakes (Magnuson et al. 2005). Recent ice-off in Maine lakes is generally occurring earlier (Hodgkins et al. 2002; Boeff et al. 2016), and is associated with the number of accumulated winter freezing and melting days (Beyene & Jain 2015). Warner et al. (2018) found that when ice-off occurred earlier in Jordan Pond in ANP, the period of spring turnover was longer, mixing depths were shallower, and the water column experienced strong thermal stratification, a trend observed in other boreal lakes (King et al. 1999). Stable thermal stratification favors buoyancy-regulating cyanobacterial taxa like Microcystis and Dolichospermum (Walsby et al. 1991) that can take advantage of light-rich surface waters and nutrient-rich bottom waters, and also facilitates surface accumulation of cyanobacterial cells (Paerl et al. 2001). Climate conditions that reduce snow cover on lake ice might reduce overwintering vegetative Microcystis cells (Brunberg & Blomqvist 2002) and increasing temperature could favor other cyanobacterial taxa over Microcystis , depending on light levels resulting from lake morphometry and/or water column stability (Carey et al. 2012a). Changes in wind speed affect thermal stratification and water column mixing, nutrient availability, and light levels (Zhang et al. 2021). Extreme precipitation events deliver pulses of dissolved organic carbon (DOC; Warner et al. 2020) and nutrients to surface waters, favoring cyanobacterial taxa that can store nutrients from these pulses, especially if the extreme precipitation events are followed by high temperatures and/or drought conditions (Jöhnk et al. 2008; Aubriot & Bonilla 2012; Huber et al. 2012; Watson et al. 2015). Nutrient availability can also contribute to the development and strength of HABs, as cyanobacteria are strong competitors for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N; Paerl & Huisman 2008). Nutrients enter lakes through external sources like stormwater runoff, but can also be released through internal cycling from lake sediments when dissolved oxygen (DO) is depleted in bottom waters (Nürnberg 1984). The productivity, or trophic state, of a lake plays an important role in dissolved oxygen dynamics—productive lakes have higher nutrient levels and are more prone to anoxic bottom waters as summer progresses. Several multi-lake experiments have shown that cyanobacterial blooms are strongly associated with total phosphorus (TP), and that oligotrophic lakes with TP Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, Cylindrospermopsis, Gloeotrichia, and Nodularia. Many cyanobacterial groups are also able to store luxury P, allowing them to thrive in both nutrient-limited and nutrient-rich conditions (Paerl et al. 2001). As Microcystis is unable to fix nitrogen, it is often associated with relatively high levels of N (Paerl et al. 2011; O’Neil et al. 2012). However, cyanobacteria have a host of physiological adaptations across environmental conditions, and can also thrive in low-nutrient, oligotrophic lakes (Carey et al. 2012b; Watson et al. 2015; Reinl et al. 2021). Oligotrophic lakes may exhibit greater sensitivity to biogeochemical responses to anthropogenic climate change than higher-nutrient lakes (Reinl et al. 2021; Fowler et al. 2022), and there is much less known about the drivers of cyanobacterial blooms in oligotrophic lakes, especially northern lakes with cooler water temperature (Creed et al. 2018). Freshwater cyanobacteria have increased across a variety of lake morphometries in oligotrophic lakes in Sweden (Freeman et al. 2020) and Ontario (Winter et al. 2011; Sorichetti et al. 2014b), and a cyanobacterial bloom was documented in an oligo-mesotrophic lake in Germany (Uveges et al. 2012). Data from the EPA National Lake Assessment show that the relative importance of nutrients and temperature on cyanobacterial biovolume varied by lake trophic state and cyanobacterial taxon (Rigosi et al. 2014). Nutrients were the most important driver of cyanobacterial biovolume in oligotrophic lakes, while temperature was a significant driver in mesotrophic lakes, and the interaction of nutrients and temperature were significant in eutrophic lakes. Microcystis was most responsive to temperature and Dolichospermum and Aphanizomenon were most sensitive to nutrient levels (Rigosi et al. 2014). Cyanobacterial blooms likely do not develop in response to a singular driver, but may form in response to high temperature at high nutrient levels, for example (Brookes & Carey 2011; Rigosi et al. 2014). In low-nutrient lakes, cyanobacteria with buoyancy regulation are able to access the nutrient-rich hypolimnion and optimal light and temperature conditions throughout the water column (Reinl et al. 2021). In northern lakes, increasing dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the landscape will likely cause a community shift favoring cyanobacteria in low-nutrient lakes, as some cyanobacteria are able to access nutrients bound to DOM (Creed et al. 2018). Fowler et al. (2022) showed paleolimnological evidence of DOM as a nutrient subsidy for algal groups including colonial cyanobacteria in Seal Cove Pond in ANP. Water clarity, sometimes estimated by water color or turbidity, can also contribute to bloom formation, as clearer water allows for greater light availability for photosynthetic processes (Carpenter & Pace 2018). Many cyanobacterial taxa use photo-protective pigments to survive high irradiance, and at the same time, to shade algal populations deeper in the water column (Paerl et al. 1983), and some taxa use photo-adaptive mechanisms to adjust to low-light conditions (Watson et al. 2015). Historically, HABs have proven difficult to predict, identify, and manage (Watson et al. 2015). A multitude of physical, chemical, and biological variables contribute to population dynamics of blooming and non-blooming assemblages, which can co-occur and vary widely temporally and spatially (Watson et al. 2015). Strategies that incorporate multiple methods for quantifying and monitoring HABs are most effective (Elser et al. 1999; Lopez et al. 2008; Watson et al. 2015). Carpenter & Pace (2018) evaluated the potential for interpreting early warning signs of HABs in two small lakes in forested, undisturbed watersheds in Michigan. They showed that direct measurements of chlorophyll a (a measure of algal biomass), phycocyanin (a pigment produced by cyanobacteria), and dissolved oxygen saturation were reliable early warning indicators of blooms, and that these variables exhibited strong synchrony during blooms (Carpenter & Pace 2018). Vulnerability assessments of resources’ sensitivity and adaptive capacity to climate change are an important piece in NPS management and planning strategies (Monahan & Fisichelli 2014), as resource vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity (IPCC 2007; Dawson et al. 2011; Gonzalez et al. 2018). While it is sometimes desirable to maximize precision of NPS resource risk assessments by incorporating many individual sites across a landscape, it may be most useful for policy and planning to maximize generality and realism at the cost of precision (Monahan & Fisichelli 2014). Therefore, our objective was to harness a multi-tool approach to create a risk assessment for a gradient of ANP lake types. Building upon the decades-long legacy of water quality monitoring in ANP, we used multiple monitoring and prediction tools to develop an early warning system to identify which lakes in ANP may be most susceptible to HAB formation and to understand how underlying environmental and lake conditions may trigger HAB development in vulnerable lakes. The effect of warming on lakes might be regulated by lake trophic status and changes in nutrient loading (Arheimer et al. 2005; Elliot 2012; Anneville et al. 2015), and research studies across a variety of lake types and trophic states will help improve understanding of resilience of lakes to algal blooms (Ortiz et al. 2020; Reinl et al. 2021). Lakes in ANP fall along a gradient of trophic states and protection from localized anthropogenic nutrient inputs: Jordan Pond is oligotrophic and fully protected (within the boundaries of ANP), Seal Cove Pond is oligo-mesotrophic and partially protected, and Witch Hole Pond is meso-eutrophic, often exceeding EPA nutrient criteria (Gawley & Wiggin 2016), and fully protected. To realize risk assessment objectives, we instrumented these three lakes with sensors to record high-frequency temperature and dissolved oxygen data, produced bathymetric maps for volumetric modeling of dissolved oxygen, and measured phycocyanin, an indicator of cyanobacteria concentration, throughout the ice-free growing season in 2020. These data were paired with meteorological data from a weather station on the Jordan Pond House. The project findings will assist resource managers in identifying which types of lakes in ANP (and potentially other NPS units) require special monitoring, and can be used as a guide for allocating limited monitoring resources. These efforts to identify vulnerable water resources and prevent HABs will protect water quality and safeguard visitors and those who rely on ANP lakes as drinking water sources. Methods Site Description Three lakes in Acadia National Park were selected for this study based on trophic status and morphological features (Figure 1). Jordan Pond, an oligotrophic lake and drinking water source, is 76 ha with a mean depth of 21 m. Seal Cove Pond (105 ha in area; 4 m mean depth) is oligo-mesotrophic and Witch Hole Pond (10 ha in area; 2 m mean depth) is meso-eutrophic (Table 1). Jordan Pond and Witch Hole Pond are entirely within ANP boundaries and are protected from watershed development and other water and land use effects, while Seal Cove Pond has residential homes on its western shore.

The buoys were deployed in February 2020 through the iceand remained submerged through fall turnover in November 2020. Buoys were deployed suchthat one PME miniPAR® Logger was positioned 2 m below the water surface, one PMEminiDOT® Logger at 3 m below the water surface, and another PME miniDOT® Logger at 2 mabove the lake bottom. HOBO Pendant® MX Water Temperature Data Loggers were placed atevery 1-m interval. All PAR sensors, dissolved oxygen sensors, and temperature sensors weresynchronized to record data in 1-hour intervals. Buoys were deployed near the site of maximumdepth in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond (13 m and 9 m, respectively) and at 32 m inJordan Pond. Meteorological data were collected from the Jordan Pond House weather station. Manual Sampling Manual sampling was done once through the ice in February 2020, and was performed approximately bi-weekly from mid-May until November 2020. A YSI EXO3 Multi-Parameter Water Quality Sonde was used for profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen at 1-m intervals. Continuous profiles of temperature, chlorophyll a fluorescence (fChl), phycocyanin fluorescence (fPhy), and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were measured using a Turner Designs C3™ Submersible Fluorometer. Water transparency was measured using a Secchi disk. In addition, water samples were taken at three depths corresponding to the epi-, meta-, and hypolimnion for each profile to measure extracted chlorophyll biomass, phytoplankton identification and enumeration, and nutrients, including TP, NO3-, NH4+, and DOC. Water samples were filtered through 0.7-μm Whatman GF/F filters to determine concentrations of inorganic nutrients (NH4+, NO3-) and DOC. NH4+, NO3-, and DOC concentrations were determined using standard phenate, cadmium reduction, and catalytic oxidation methods, respectively (American Public Health Association 2000). Chlorophyll a concentration (chl a ), a proxy for algal biomass, was measured by filtering whole water samples (kept in light-blocking bottles) through 0.7-μm Whatman GF/F filters, after which the filters were frozen for more than 24 hours, placed in 90% acetone, and analyzed using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer within two weeks of collection using standardized methods (American Public Health Association 2000). All water sample analyses were conducted at the University of Maine Sawyer Water Research Laboratory. Phytoplankton Cell Density Phytoplankton identification and enumeration was performed for samples at three depths on four separate dates for both Jordan Pond and Seal Cove Pond. Subsamples of whole water samples were fixed in Lugol’s Iodine solution and stored in the dark until 20 to 25 ml was settled in an Utermöhl chamber for at least 12 hours. Phytoplankton were then counted along two transects at 600x magnification using a Nikon TS100 inverted microscope. Raw cell counts were converted to cell density (ml-1) based on subsample volume settled and the number of transects that were counted (Hillebrand et al. 1999). Individuals were identified to genus using Wehr et al. (2015), except for unidentified non-flagellated cells and unidentified cysts. Bathymetry Bathymetric maps of the three study lakes were generated using ReefMaster® software using a Humminbird 597ci sonar device. Long-Term Data Long-term datasets (1995-2020) for Secchi disk depth, dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll, and nutrients were obtained from the ANP NPS water quality monitoring program to evaluate risk assessments. Weather data (2013-2022) including wind speed, precipitation, and air temperature records from the Jordan Pond House weather station were used for historic comparisons of meteorological variables. Data Analysis Data analyses were performed using R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team 2021). The function thermocline.depth was used from the package rLakeAnalyzer (Winslow et al. 2019). To create the risk assessment scorecard, we used ANP lake data compiled from the Maine Department of Environmental Protection and Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. A weighted average was created using the following variables: trophic status, flushing rate, maximum depth, whether the lake stratifies, and whether the lake is fully or partially protected within the ANP boundary. These parameters were categorized and weighted as follows: Trophic state: Oligotrophic = 1, Mesotrophic = 2, Eutrophic = 3 Flushing rate: >10 yr -1 = 1, 1 to 10 yr -1 = 2, -1 = 3 Maximum depth: >25 m = 1, 10 to 25 m = 2, Stratifies? No = 1, Yes = 2 Fully protected within ANP boundary? Yes = 1, No = 1.5 The weighted average produced unit-less values for each lake between 1.3 and 2.5. The lakes were sorted into risk assessment categories based on the following criteria: Low concern: 
Moderate concern: 1.8 to 2.0 Considerable concern >2.0 Results Light Average Secchi depth during the stratified period was 15.1 m in Jordan Pond (n=5), 6.6 m in Seal Cove Pond (n=5), and 4.9 m in Witch Hole Pond (n=5; Figure 2).

Witch Hole Pond temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), phycocyanin fluorescence, and chlorophyll a fluorescence across spring, summer, and fall 2020. Temperature In 2020, Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond thermally stratified on 5/28, 5/22,  and 5/18, respectively (Figures 6, 7). We define the onset of stratification as the first day there is  a ≥ 1°C difference per meter in the water column, as in Warner et al. (2018). In Jordan Pond, the maximum temperature of the top sensor was 24.9°C on 8/14/20. Maximum temperatures were 28.1°C on 7/31/20 in Seal Cove Pond and 28.6°C on 8/1/20 in Witch Hole Pond. Epilimnion temperatures were >25°C in Seal Cove Pond from 7/22/20 to 8/17/20 and in Witch Hole Pond from 7/19/20 to 8/17/20. After stratification, the temperature recorded by the bottom sensor remained at approximately 6.6°C for the remainder of the season in Jordan Pond. Temperature recorded by the bottom sensor increased throughout the summer to approximately 20°C and 16°C in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond, respectively (Figure 6). Figure 6. miniDOT water temperature measurements from the top and bottom of the water column in  Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch Hole Pond. Figure 7. Temperature plots interpolated from biweekly 1-m interval water column sampling. Dissolved Oxygen Jordan Pond exhibited very different dissolved oxygen dynamics than Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond (Figures 8, 9). Both top and bottom sensors recorded 13.2 mg L - 1 dissolved  oxygen (DO) in Jordan Pond at the beginning of March 2020, around the timing of ice out (Figure 8). Bottom-water DO gradually declined throughout the season, reaching 8.7 mg L - 1 at  the beginning of October. Top-water DO gradually declined at the same rate as bottom-water  DO until mid-May, when top-water DO decreased more steeply. The minimum DO recorded by  the top sensor in Jordan Pond was 7.3 mg L - 1 at the  end of August. During September, top-water DO in Jordan Pond increased to 10.8 mg L - 1 .  Seasonal DO patterns were different in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond. After ice-out in Seal Cove Pond, both top and bottom  sensors recorded 11 to 12 mg L - 1 DO, which decreased  at the same rate for both sensors until  the end of May, when the bottom sensor measured steeper rates of DO decline, until anoxia (- 1  ) occurred during the last week of July and lasted until the beginning of September.  During this time, DO at the top sensor remained relatively steady, averaging 7.7 mg L - 1 . At the  beginning of September, bottom-water DO increased abruptly and matched top-water DO, 8.6  mg L - 1 . Patterns of top- and bottom-water DO in Witch  Hole Pond were similar to those in Seal  Cove Pond, but anoxia at the bottom DO sensor occurred earlier in the season, at the beginning  of July, and lasted longer, through late September. DO measurements were more variable at the  top sensor in Witch Hole Pond from July through September, averaging 7.5 mg L - 1 .

Dissolved oxygen (DO) plots interpolated from biweekly 1-m interval water column sampling.  Black lines represent 5 mg L  -1  , a threshold for dissolved  oxygen below which many aquatic organisms  cannot thrive. Phycocyanin Water column measurements of phycocyanin fluorescence and interpolated values were low ( Figure 10. Phycocyanin fluorescence plots interpolated from biweekly 1-m interval water column sampling. Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll fluorescence trends were slightly different than phycocyanin fluorescence trends (Figure 11). In Jordan Pond, chlorophyll RFU was consistently low ( Figure 11. Chlorophyll a fluorescence plots interpolated from biweekly 1-m interval water column sampling. Figure 12 represents seasonal averages of chl a fluorescence  along with seasonal averages of  extracted chl  a  biomass of water samples from the  epi-, meta-, and hypolimnia of each lake. In  the spring, Jordan Pond had a chlorophyll maximum (DCM) of 2 µg L - 1 i n the metalimnion at 10  m depth, with values ≤1.2 µg L - 1 throughout the water  column during the rest of the open-water  season. In the spring, extracted chl  a  was higher i n Seal Cove Pond in the epilimnion, reaching  2.7 µg L - 1 . During the summer, maximum extracted chl  a i n Seal Cove Pond was 6.3 µg L - 1 ,  near  the thermocline at 5 m depth. In the spring at Witch Hole Pond, extracted chl  a  was higher  throughout much of the water column than in Jordan Pond and Seal Cove Pond, at 2 to 3 µg L - 1 .  During the summer, extracted chl  a  peaked at 9.3 µg  L - 1 i n the hypolimnion of Witch Hole Pond.  Epilimnion chl  a  decreased to an average of 4.5 µg  L - 1 i n the fall. For the duration of stratification i n 2020, average epilimnion extracted chl  a  was 0.9  µg L - 1 , 2.3 µg L - 1 , and 4.0 µg L - 1 for Jordan  Pond (n=9), Seal Cove Pond (n=9), and Witch Hole Pond (n=8), respectively. Figure 12. Seasonal chlorophyll  a  fluorescence from biweekly 1-m interval water column sampling plotted on the x-axis and extracted chlorophyll  a  overlaid on the depth (y) axis as colored circles. (Note the difference in chl  a  values on the Witch Hole Pond summer x-axis.) Nutrients & Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) During the period of stratification, nutrients in Jordan Pond were generally low in the epi-, meta-  and hypolimnion (Figure 13). Average epilimnion TP and TN were 2.7 µg L - 1 and 96 µg L - 1 ,  respectively (n=9). The ratio of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to TP, which can be useful for l imiting nutrient limitation (Bergstrom 2010), was >3.4 throughout the water column for much of  the sampling period (average=5.5), indicating phosphorus (P) limitation. In Seal Cove Pond,  average epilimnion TP and TN were 4.7 µg L - 1 and 200  µg L - 1 , respectively (n=9). Most of the  DIN:TP values for Seal Cove Pond fell between 1.5 to 3.4, with some higher values in the fall i ndicating possible P-limitation (average=2.1). In Witch Hole Pond, average epilimnion TP and  TN were 9.2 µg L - 1 and 259 µg L - 1 , respectively (n=8).  TP and NH  4 + concentrations in Witch Hole  Pond were higher throughout all seasons at all depths than in Jordan Pond and Seal Cove  Pond, and NO  3 - was similar to Seal Cove Pond and lower  than in Jordan Pond in the summer  and fall. The DIN:TP ratio of Witch Hole Pond indicates potential N-limitation in the epilimnion in  the spring, at all depths in the summer, and in the epilimnion in the fall. Average epilimnion  DIN:TP was 1.4. Figure 13. Total phosphorus (TP), nitrate (NO  3  -  ),  ammonium (NH  4  +  ), and DIN:TP ratio in the epi-, meta-,  and hypolimnia of Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch Hole Pond across seasons in 2020. Average epilimnion DOC was 1.8 mg L - 1 i n Jordan Pond  (n=9), 4.0 mg L - 1 i n Seal Cove Pond (n=9), and 3.6 mg L - 1 i n Witch Hole Pond (n=8). Phytoplankton Cell Density Phytoplankton cell density was generally low (≤1000 cells ml - 1 ) during winter and spring  sampling in Jordan Pond, with greater cell density in the hypolimnion (Figure 14). Cell density  was high (~2000 cells ml - 1 ) in the epi- and metalimnia  of Jordan Pond during the summer.  During this time, there was a relatively high proportion of haptophytes, followed by diatoms.  Approximately 8% of the phytoplankton cell density in the metalimnion during the summer was  attributed to cyanobacteria, particularly Aphanocapsa and Aphanothece (Figure 15). These  genera belong to different taxonomic orders than Aphanizomenon ,  but may still produce toxins  under certain conditions. Phytoplankton cell density in Seal Cove Pond was highest in the epilimnion in the spring (~2400 cells ml - 1 ), and was  primarily composed of chrysophytes,  followed by cryptophytes. In the summer, cell density decreased to approximately 1100 cells ml - 1 i n the epilimnion of Seal Cove Pond, did not change in the metalimnion, and increased in the  hypolimnion. The relative proportions of taxa changed at all depths. Haptophytes,  dinoflagellates, and chrysophytes made up the greatest proportions of phytoplankton in the epi-  and metalimnia, while haptophytes dominated in the hypolimnion. The relative proportion of cyanobacteria in Seal Cove Pond was low across depths and seasons. The greatest proportion  of cyanobacteria in Seal Cove Pond was Dolichospermum i n the epilimnion during spring (~1%  of phytoplankton cell density). We do not have phytoplankton cell density counts for Witch Hole  Pond at this time. Figure 14. Phytoplankton cell density in the epi-, meta-, and hypolimnia of Jordan Pond and Seal Cove Pond across seasons in 2020. Figure 15. Cyanobacterial cell density in the epi-, meta-, and hypolimnia of Jordan Pond and Seal Cove  Pond across seasons in 2020. Historical Perspectives The Air & Water Quality program at ANP has provided a rich set of lake data from 1995 to 2020, i ncluding Secchi depth, chlorophyll a concentration,  DOC concentration, TP, TN, and TN:TP (Figure 16). The 25%, 50%, and 75% quantile regression values listed in Table 2 can be used as a historical baseline against which to compare contemporary values of Secchi depth, chlorophyll a , DOC, and nutrients. Sustained values  surpassing 75% quantiles of a given metric or combination of metrics might provide early warning signals that a lake is approaching a  threshold that could support HAB formation and development. We will refer to the historical data  from Table 2 throughout the Discussion as we contextualize the 2020 sampling results of this  project. Summer DOC sampling for the Northeast Temperate Network did not begin until 2012,  creating a gap in DOC concentration data from 2006-2012. Figure 16.

Air temperature declined through late summer into the fall, and average air temperature was 15.2°C i n September. In Maine, 2020 was a drought year, and precipitation frequency and magnitude  were low in the weather station data. Notable precipitation events occurred on 6/26/20 (13 mm),  6/29/20 (11 mm), 8/29/20 (25 mm), and 10/14/20 (27 mm). Mean and maximum wind speed  were high at the beginning of June, then decreased through July and the beginning of August  before increasing throughout the fall. Mean wind speed in June and September were 1.6 m s - 1 and 1.8 m s - 1 , respectively, and maximum wind speed reached 5.9 m s - 1 at the beginning of June  and 5.7 m s - 1 on 8/23/20, followed by more days in  the fall with similar maximum wind speed  values, following the mean wind speed trend.

Lake Bathymetry Jordan Pond (Figure 18) and Seal Cove Pond (Figure 19) are aligned on a north-south axis, and  Witch Hole Pond (Figure 20) is tilted on a southwest-northeast axis. Mean depth of Jordan Pond i s 21.1 m, maximum lake depth is 49.3 m, and surface area is 75.9 ha. For Seal Cove Pond,  mean lake depth is 4.0 m, maximum depth is 13.7 m, and surface area is 104.7 ha. Witch Hole  Pond mean depth is 2.1 m, maximum depth is 10 m, and surface area is 9.7 ha. Figure 18. Jordan Pond bathymetric map. Figure 19. Seal Cove Pond bathymetric map. Figure 20.

Risk Assessment Scorecard Jordan Pond, Bubble Pond, Eagle Lake, Upper Breakneck Pond, and Long Pond (MDI) were categorized  as having low risk for development of potential future HABs (Figure 21). Seal Cove Pond, Aunt Betty  Pond, Lake Wood, Upper and Lower Hadlock Ponds, Echo Lake, Bear Brook Pond, and Lower  Breakneck Pond were classified as moderate risk. Witch Hole Pond, Round Pond, Hodgdon Pond, and  Seawall Pond were categorized as having considerable risk for future development of HABs. Of the six  drinking water lakes in ANP, four were included in the “low risk” category (Bubble Pond, Eagle Lake,  Jordan Pond, and Long Pond) and two were in the “moderate risk” category (Upper Hadlock Pond and  Lower Hadlock Pond). Figure 21. Assessment of ANP lakes’ vulnerability to future HAB development. Discussion Key Findings among Lakes: Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen, & Phycocyanin Temperature and dissolved oxygen trends in Jordan Pond during the open water season of  2020 deviated from those of Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond. The epilimnetic temperature i n Jordan Pond remained lower than that of Seal Cove and Witch Hole Ponds, while the  temperature of the bottom sensor (30 m depth) remained at approximately 6.6°C after  stratification. The bottom sensor temperature measurements of Seal Cove Pond (10 m depth)  and Witch Hole Pond (7 m depth) increased throughout the season to maxima of 20°C and  16°C, respectively. Dissolved oxygen in the epilimnion of Jordan Pond declined from 13 mg L - 1 at the beginning of  the open water season to a minimum of 7 mg L - 1 at  the end of August. Dissolved oxygen  measured by the bottom sensor declined more gradually over the season, and was often  greater than DO measured by the top sensor. In Seal Cove and Witch Hole Ponds, epilimnetic  DO was similar to that of Jordan Pond, but DO measured by the bottom sensors declined  rapidly throughout the season. Anoxia in the bottom water occurred from the last week in July to  early September in SCP and from early July to late September in WHP. Phycocyanin was generally low throughout the water column of Jordan Pond and Seal Cove Pond during the ice-free season, except for some isolated instances during the summer. Near  the surface, however, phycocyanin peaked after ice-out and occurred again in July in Jordan  Pond and at the end of September in Seal Cove Pond. In Witch Hole Pond, water column  phycocyanin persisted at most depths throughout the ice-free season, particularly in the summer months. Water column measurements of phycocyanin were lower in WHP than surface  phycocyanin peaks in JP and SCP. Context for Findings: Roles in HAB Formation Temperature and Thermal Stratification Air temperature has increased substantially in the northeast United States over the last century  (Vose et al. 2017), and climate models forecast sustained, rapid temperature increase in Maine  (Fernandez et al. 2020). Therefore, it is likely that surface water temperature will continue to i ncrease in Maine lakes, as surface water temperature has been linked to air temperature (Paerl  et al. 2008; Taranu et al., 2012; O’Reilly et al. 2015). Surface water temperature is a strong  predictor of cyanobacterial blooms (Kosten et al., 2012; Persaud et al. 2015). In Canadian  temperate lakes (Persaud et al. 2015), and a large study of lakes across a latitudinal gradient  from Europe to South America (Kosten et al. 2012), cyanobacterial biovolume increased with  water temperature. In a study of 200+ lakes in northeastern North America, Richardson et al. (2017) found that from 1975-2012, lakes had increasing surface temperatures and stronger  thermal stratification. Lakes nearer to the Atlantic coast ( As in Pilla et al. (2018), Richardson et al. (2017) described trends of near-surface water temperatures of northeastern North American lakes rising faster than air temperature, suggesting that our region may be a warming hotspot for lakes, similar to areas around the Laurentian Great Lakes and northern Europe (O’Reilly et al. 2015). These lakes may be changing more quickly than lakes in other mid-latitude regions due to amplified climate effects  (i.e. warmer temperature with more precipitation; Richardson et al. 2017). The clearest lakes in  the study (Secchi >5m) warmed the most rapidly and experienced the greatest increases in  thermal stratification strength (Richardson et al. 2017). Cyanobacteria generally dominate at high temperatures as a result of physiological and physical  factors (O’Neil et al. 2012). Warmer water reduces the density of the epilimnion, thus  strengthening vertical stratification (Paerl & Huisman 2009), and cyanobacteria typically experience optimal growth rates in warmer water, >25°C (Robarts & Zohary 1987; Coles & Jones 2000; Paerl & Huisman 2009). With increasing water temperature and limited wind mixing, the water column becomes stagnant and buoyant cyanobacteria move upward through  the water column, sometimes leading to surface blooms and concentrations of toxins (Paerl &  Huisman 2009). The viscosity of water is reduced as temperature increases (Hutchinson 1957), and according to Stokes Law, the vertical velocity of small organisms (like cyanobacteria) are i nversely proportional to viscosity (Reynolds 2006). Therefore, increasing water temperature  reduces resistance to upward vertical migration by buoyant cyanobacteria. This process allows  competitive advantage of buoyant cyanobacteria over diatoms in stratified water (Jöhnk et al.  2008; Paerl & Huisman 2009). In lakes, warm winters can influence subsequent seasonal succession, through the lakes’ “ecological memory” (Anneville et al. 2015). Padisak (1992) described ecological memory as the  capacity of an ecosystem or its past states to influence current or future responses of the community. For example, Anneville et al. (2015) found an autumn exceptional hot weather period (EHWP) promoted cyanobacteria growth in mesotrophic lakes and increased cyanobacterial biomass, but did not change the composition of the phytoplankton community, indicating that warmer autumns benefit the entire phytoplankton community. The EHWP did not  affect an oligotrophic lake, perhaps because P concentration was too low to support high phytoplankton biomass (Anneville et al. 2015). At high temperatures in eutrophic lakes, stable  water columns can promote cyanobacterial blooms (Paerl 1988; Zhang & Prepas 1996). The i nteraction of water temperature and lake trophic state is a key factor in explaining  phytoplankton biomass (Rigosi et al. 2014, Kraemer et al. 2017). Reinl et al. (2023) described how cyanobacterial blooms can also occur during cold water  conditions, even when lakes are ice-covered. According to Wetzel (2001), most lakes are located in regions where water temperatures are Aphanizomenon sp. formed a surface scum in Salmon  Lake, ME, and late-fall blooms of Microcystis have also occurred in New York and Vermont  after fall turnover (Reinl et al. 2023). The maximum temperature recorded by the top miniDOT sensor in Jordan Pond was 24.9°C on  8/14/20. Surface temperatures in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond reached >28°C at the  end of July and beginning of August, respectively, and both lakes experienced temperatures 25°C for 4-5 weeks spanning the second half of July into the third week of August. Data from  the Jordan Pond Buoy Project and ANP Air & Water Quality program show that average August  surface water has increased almost 2°C since 2013, while the annual average temperature of  the hypolimnion has increased approximately 2°C (Gawley 2023). Similar increases have  occurred in Seal Cove Pond, with average epilimnion temperature rising from 18°C in 2006 to  20°C in 2018. In Witch Hole Pond, average epilimnion temperature (May-September) increased  from 18.5°C in 2006 to 21°C in 2022. If cyanobacteria typically experience optimal growth in  water temperature >25°C (Robarts & Zohary 1987; Coles & Jones 2000; Paerl & Huisman  2009), Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond may be most vulnerable to cyanobacterial blooms,  particularly from the third week in July to the third week in August. Long-term water temperature  trends suggest that average surface water temperatures in all three lakes are increasing  steadily, with the greatest long-term increase in epilimnion temperature occurring in Witch Hole  Pond. If present in the lakes, buoyant cyanobacterial taxa like Microcystis and Dolichospermum may have a competitive advantage over other phytoplankton groups during periods of high  epilimnetic temperature. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) “Oxygen is the most fundamental parameter of lakes and streams, aside from water itself” (Wetzel 2001). In eutrophic waters, DO is a precursor for cyanobacterial blooms (Trimbee &  Prepas 1988), especially when water temperature is high and the water column is stable, during  the period of summer stratification. With oxygen depletion in bottom water, lake sediments can  release P, which benefits buoyant cyanobacteria taxa. Increases in water temperature stimulate  decomposition of organic matter and microbial respiration and decrease oxygen solubility (Hutchinson 1957; Blumberg & Di Toro 1990; Jenny et al. 2016). Generally, the prevalence and duration of hypolimnetic anoxia are increasing with climate change effects and land use change  (Jenny et al. 2016; Jane et al. 2021; Carey et al. 2022). However, increasing severity and  frequency of storms can increase lake water mixing and oxygen availability throughout the water  column (Prein et al. 2017), so there may be large daily fluctuations in DO concentration (Perello  et al. 2017; Carey et al. 2022). Hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentration influences internal nutrient loading (Pettersson et  al. 2003; Adrian et al. 2009)—DO depletion in the hypolimnion can prompt the release of P (Nürnberg 1984; Prepas & Vickery 1984) and ammonium (Wetzel 2001) into the water column  (Foley et al. 2012). Furthermore, Fe may undergo reduction during anoxic conditions, leading to  release from sediments as Fe  2+  , which is more biologically available. Algal blooms can lead to  anoxic bottom-water conditions, creating a positive feedback cycle that stimulates nuisance  blooms, especially those created by buoyant taxa that can move from nutrient-rich bottom  waters to oxygen-rich surface waters (Paerl et al. 2001; Huber et al. 2012; Rigosi et al. 2014;  Wagner & Adrian 2009; Paerl et al. 2018). Additionally, increases in the duration of the  stratification period isolate bottom water from access to atmospheric oxygen for longer periods  (Foley et al. 2012). Therefore, poorly flushed lakes that experience strong thermal stratification  promote hypoxic or anoxic conditions and may be more likely to experience harmful algal  blooms (Paerl et al. 2001). When lake mixing occurs, the accumulated P is transported to the  epilimnion (Riley & Prepas 1984), potentially promoting algal growth (Trimbee & Prepas 1988). Trimbee & Prepas (1988) found that even without sediment P release, the onset of anoxic  conditions (- 1  ) over lake sediments could boost  the proportion of cyanobacteria biomass i n the phytoplankton community. Anoxic conditions over lake sediments favor recruitment of  benthic overwintering colonies or filaments of cyanobacteria (Reynolds et al. 1981; Trimbee &  Harris 1984). Basin morphometry also plays an important role in anoxia (Molot et al. 2014).  Recruitment of cyanobacteria decreases with lake depth, and also with the proportion of lake  sediment overlain by oxic water (Trimbee & Prepas 1988). These findings suggest that the  timing and extent of oxygen depletion of bottom waters can be used as predictors of timing and  magnitude of harmful algal blooms in north temperate lakes (Trimbee & Prepas 1988; Jane et  al. 2021). While anoxia did not occur in deep Jordan Pond, bottom-water anoxia was present from late  July to early September in Seal Cove Pond, and from early July to late September in Witch Hole  Pond. These anoxic conditions, of longest duration in Witch Hole Pond, may favor recruitment of  benthic overwintering cyanobacteria. As recruitment decreases with lake depth (Trimbee &  Prepas 1988), Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond may be more likely to have sedimentary  cyanobacterial recruitment. Bottom-water anoxia in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond could  act as a precursor to peaks in cyanobacterial biomass, as observed in a north temperate  stratified lake in mid-late August (Trimbee & Prepas 1988). Zhao et al. (2019) found that cyanobacterial blooms correlated to DO levels of 5.0 to 8.3 mg L  −1 i n temperate lakes and reservoirs in China. These levels are higher than DO measurements  from bottom sensors in Seal Cove and Witch Hole Ponds from most of the stratified season, as  well as top waters from late-June onward in Witch Hole Pond, July onward in Seal Cove Pond,  and in Jordan Pond during parts of August and September. Dissolved oxygen had complicated seasonal patterns in other north temperate lakes (Hanson et  al. 2006). Peaks in DO occurred shortly after ice-off and before ice-on, and minima occurred in l ate-winter and during the summer. Such annual patterns show that DO is mediated on a  seasonal scale by biological processes in addition to fluctuations in temperature (Hanson et al.  2006, Jane et al. 2021). For example, Hanson et al. (2006) showed that DO minima have  occurred 10 days after peak water temperature. Wong & Hobbs (2020) described seasonal  trends in water temperature and DO increasing in early summer and peaking in August to early  September, indicating increased photosynthetic activity during warmer periods that are  characteristic of an algal bloom. In mid-September, DO declined as the algal bloom dissipated. The DO patterns reported by Wong & Hobbs (2020) in a lake that experiences algal blooms are  not evident in Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, or Witch Hole Pond. Instead of increasing with  temperature, peaking in August to early September, and declining in mid-September, epilimnetic  DO in all three lakes had an inverse relationship with temperature, reaching minima during the  summer and gradually increasing after mid-September. As in Hanson et al. (2006), epilimnetic  DO minima in ANP lakes occurred after peak water temperature—14 days for Jordan Pond, 19  days for Seal Cove Pond, and 15 days for Witch Hole Pond. These results suggest that DO in  Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch Hole Pond is regulated by biological processes as  well as physical processes (such as temperature), but that the role of biological processes (e.g.  algal primary productivity) is weaker than in the lake described by Wong & Hobbs (2020) that regularly experiences cyanobacterial blooms. Anoxic conditions are common in Maine lakes during peak stratification (8/1 to 9/7; Deeds et al.  2021). Anoxia was observed in 647 out of 951 Maine lakes surveyed (ME DEP 2015). However,  many lakes in Maine have low epilimnion TP concentrations during peak stratification (median  9.0 µg L - 1 ), and may be predisposed to anoxia resulting  from natural conditions, as opposed to  anthropogenic nutrient enrichment (Deeds et al. 2021). Water clarity also contributes to trends in  DO. In lakes with low clarity (Secchi - 1  , relative to 3.42 mg L - 1 i n other l akes) due to sinking and decomposition of algal biomass in bottom-water habitats (Jane et al.  2021). Like other Maine lakes described by Deeds et al. (2021), the bottom waters of Seal Cove  Pond and Witch Hole Pond became anoxic during peak stratification. However, Secchi depth is  greater than 2 m in all three lakes, so clarity may not be a strong driver of DO in these lakes. Nutrients & Dissolved Organic Carbon The role of nutrients in promoting harmful algal blooms is well documented, with evidence that i n freshwater North American and European lakes, P is the main driver of algal blooms (Schindler 2012; Schindler et al. 2016), or that both N and P are instrumental in HAB  development (Paerl et al. 2001; Watson et al. 2015). For example, lakes with TP  - 1  generally don’t support HABs (Downing et al. 2001; Schindler et al. 2012). Within-lake  nitrogen-fixation, even in eutrophic lakes, however, may be too low to sustain ecosystem N  requirements, so N inputs to lakes may play a key roles in HAB development of some systems  (Paerl et al. 2018). The U.S. EPA Nutrient Ecoregion 8 (including the entire states of Maine,  New Hampshire, and Vermont) nutrient criteria for lakes are TP ≤8 µg L - 1 and TN ≤240 µg L - 1 (U.S. EPA 2000a). These values represent levels that protect lakes from over-enrichment of  nutrients from cultural eutrophication and maintain quality of water resources (Gawley & Wiggin  2016). In lakes, delivery of P via short-term and seasonal loading events is important for primary  productivity and formation of HABs (Pearl et al. 2001). Discharge of P to lakes can occur via  surface runoff during spring melt or in acute pulses from precipitation events (Paerl et al. 2001),  and can be introduced by anthropogenic activities, especially in lakes that are not protected  from anthropogenic inputs. In lakes, TP is regulated by geology and hydrology of the watershed.  Basin morphometry can also induce naturally-occurring anoxia (Deeds et al. 2021). While N  exists in several dissolved and particulate forms in lakes, and can be transformed to aqueous  and gaseous forms that are biologically available and can be exchanged between the  atmosphere, water column, and sediment, P exists in fewer biologically available aqueous forms  (Paerl et al. 2001). In 2020, average epilimnetic TP and TN were similar to or lower than the long-term averages (1995-2020) in all three study lakes. TN in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond were lower  than or equal to 25% quantiles of long-term averages (ANP Water Quality data). Average  epilimnetic TP was  - 1 i n both Jordan Pond (2.7  µg L - 1 ) and Seal Cove Pond (4.7 µg L - 1 ),  and was 9.2 µg L - 1 i n Witch Hole Pond during the stratified  period. Average epilimnetic TN was   - 1 i n Jordan Pond (96 µg L - 1 ) and Seal Cove  Pond (200 µg L - 1 ), and was 259 µg L - 1 i n  Witch Hole Pond. Even though TP and TN concentrations in Witch Hole Pond were high enough  to support HABs and surpass the EPA nutrient criteria for lakes in 2020, average epilimnetic TP  and TN in Witch Hole Pond were similar to the 1995-2020 long-term averages. During anoxic conditions, P is predicted to be released from the sediment if the sediment ratio of  aluminum (Al) to iron (Fe) is Eutrophic, P-enriched lakes with N:PAphanizomenon,  Dolichospermum, and Cylindrospermopsis , while lakes with N:P>20 are more  susceptible to non-nitrogen fixing taxa like Microcystis and Planktothrix (Schindler 1977;  Smith et al. 1999; Havens et al. 2003; Watson  et al. 2015). Watson et al. (2015) describe how seasonal succession of bloom-formers with  different environmental optima can occur in lakes with shifting N dynamics. After biologically  available N is drawn down by spring blooms of diatoms and green algae, N-fixing cyanobacterial  taxa increase, and may then be succeeded by non-N-fixing cyanobacterial taxa (Paerl et al.  2018). Microcystis, Dolichospermum , and Cylindrospermopsis are highly competitive for  dissolved inorganic P and also have the ability to acquire P from organic compounds (O’Neil et  al. 2012). With wide availability of N sources, these taxa can dominate during eutrophic  conditions, but also when concentrations of N and P are low, due to their competitive  advantages (O’Neil et al. 2012).  In Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch Hole Pond, long-term annual epilimnetic TN:TP>20, suggesting that if cyanobacterial blooms occurred in  these lakes, they might be composed of non-N-fixing taxa like Microcystis . Because N and P are both generally low in northern lakes, researchers have highlighted the i mportance of dissolved organic matter (DOM) as a driver of HAB formation (Sorichetti et al.  2014; Creed et al. 2018). Many cyanobacterial taxa can use DOM as a nutrient source (Paerl et  al. 2001). Additionally, increases in DOM can alter light dynamics in lakes by absorbing UV  radiation and decreasing the depth of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; Finstad et al.  2014). These conditions may select for positively buoyant cells, like cyanobacteria (Creed et al. 2018). Increasing DOC concentration in brown-water lakes is also associated with warmer epilimnia and cooler hypolimnia (Pilla et al. 2018), which may increase oxygen concentration in the hypolimnia (Nelligan et al. 2019). However, lakes with higher DOC concentrations (e.g. >10 mg  L - 1 ; Couture et al. 2015) also experience greater  microbial oxygen demand (Clilverd et al. 2009)  and thermal stability (Fee et al. 1996; Pilla et al. 2018), so brown-water lakes may experience  more frequent and longer low-oxygen conditions (Brothers et al. 2014; Couture et al. 2015). In 2020, average epilimnetic DOC concentrations in Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch  Hole Pond were relatively low: ≤4 mg L - 1 . These concentrations  are similar to or lower than the l ong-term 1995-2020 averages. DOC concentrations are consistently greater and Secchi depths  are shallower in browner Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond compared to clear Jordan  Pond. In a comparison of algal dynamics over the last two centuries in browner Seal Cove Pond  versus clearer Jordan Pond, Fowler et al. (2022) found evidence of more and different types of  cyanobacterial pigments in Seal Cove Pond than in Jordan Pond. Terrestrial subsidies of DOC  to Seal Cove Pond may have contributed to these algal dynamics. Chlorophyll a While measures of the pigment chlorophyll, an indicator of algal biomass, are sometimes correlated with phycocyanin fluorescence (Kasinak et al. 2015; Wong & Hobbs 2020), chlorophyll may not accurately represent the cyanobacterial population (Rigosi et al. 2014). Total chlorophyll a and cyanobacterial biomass can  differ in response to environmental variables like temperature and nutrients (Elliott et al. 2006). In a whole-lake experiment, Buelo et al. (2022) used a lake-specific threshold of 14 µg L - 1 chl a to mark the date of algal bloom onset in a small oligotrophic lake in Michigan (46°N), based on  region-specific historical data from Wilkinson et al. (2018). In this lake, the timing of the algal  bloom, indicated by chl  a  measurements, coincided  with a peak in phycocyanin fluorescence, as  well as a peak in dissolved oxygen (Buelo et al. 2022). In the same lake, Pace et al. (2017)  documented simultaneous increases in chlorophyll concentration and phycocyanin fluorescence, with a chlorophyll max near 40 µg L - 1 occurring at the end of June. While there is  not a specific threshold that defines algal bloom conditions across all lakes, chlorophyll a concentration of ~20 µg L - 1 corresponds to trophic  state index (TSI) of 60, indicative of highly  enriched lake conditions (Carlson & Simpson 1996; Pace et al. 2017). During peak stratification in 2020, average epilimnetic chlorophyll a concentrations were ≤4 µg  L - 1 , below the values given in the studies above as l ake-specific thresholds for algal blooms.  Compared to long-term trends (1995-2020), chlorophyll a concentration was similar to the  average in Jordan Pond, below the 25% quantile (below average) in Seal Cove Pond, and  between the 50% and 75% quantiles (above average) in Witch Hole Pond. Chlorophyll fluorescence was generally low on the surface and in the water column of Jordan Pond, and higher in the water column of Seal Cove Pond in the spring and early summer. Witch Hole Pond  had the highest chlorophyll fluorescence in the water column, particularly from mid-summer to  early fall, during the anoxic period. Increases in algal biomass during this time may have been  fueled by internal P loading. DIN:TP data from 2020 suggest that Witch Hole Pond was more l ikely to have been N-limited in the summer, but that the hypolimnion was P-limited during the fall. Basin Morphometry In lakes with TP  - 1  , basin morphometry may  be a primary driver of areal anoxia and  dissolved oxygen depletion rates (Molot et al. 1992; Molot et al. 2014). The morphometric ratio  of a lake (mean depth:(surface area)  0.5  ; Osgood 1988) i s positively correlated to anoxia in  stratified lakes (Nürnberg 1995). Lakes with a high morphometric ratio are generally more  strongly stratified (Foley et al. 2012). The morphometric ratio of Jordan Pond is 2.4, while Seal  Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond have much smaller morphometric ratios, of 0.4 and 0.7,  respectively. Consistent with findings of Molot et al. (2014) and Nürnberg (1995), seasonal  anoxia occurred in Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond, and not Jordan Pond. With a model using data from >400 Maine lakes, Deeds et al. (2021) found that basin  morphometry and thermal stratification are the most important drivers of anoxia in low-nutrient  temperate lakes in Maine. Specifically, maximum lake depth and proportion of total lake area  under the epilimnetic mixed layer during peak stratification were the greatest predictors of  hypolimnetic anoxia. The likelihood of hypolimnetic anoxia increases with decreasing maximum l ake depth and increasing lake area beneath the mixed layer (Deeds et al. 2021). Maximum depth is correlated to lake volume—deeper and more voluminous dimictic lakes hold  more dissolved oxygen and lose relatively less hypolimnetic oxygen before fall turnover restores  DO throughout the water column due to larger DO reserves and greater thermal stability (Deeds  et al. 2021). In lakes with large shallow areas with a high proportion of sediment in contact with  epilimnetic waters (small area under mixed layer), dissolved oxygen may be regularly  replenished from surface mixing with the epilimnion. In contrast, lakes with smaller shallow  areas in contact with the epilimnion (large area under mixed layer), are more likely to  experience depletion of DO without replenishment from the epilimnion (Deeds et al. 2021).  Lakes that are shallower, with large catchment area to lake area ratios, tend to be darker in  color with higher TP concentrations (Webster et al. 2008). Like other large lakes described by Deeds et al. (2021), Jordan Pond is deep and voluminous, and has high hypolimnetic DO throughout the stratified period, likely due to strong thermal  stratification and large reserves of DO. Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond are shallower, with larger catchment area to lake area ratios than Jordan Pond. Similar to the lakes in Webster  et al. (2008), they are also darker in color with higher TP concentrations than Jordan Pond. The  morphometric characteristics of Jordan Pond make it less susceptible to anoxic conditions than  those of Seal Cove Pond or Witch Hole Pond, which could lead to reduced risk of HAB  development. Meteorological Variables In addition to lake and watershed variables, harmful algal blooms are also driven by meteorological conditions like air temperature (Paerl & Huisman 2008; Kosten et al. 2012; Taranu et al. 2012), precipitation (Reichwaldt & Ghadouani 2012; Romo et al. 2013), and wind  speed and direction (Kanoshina et al. 2003; Cao et al. 2006). These variables affect thermal  stratification, primary production, dilution, PAR, and sediment and nutrient dynamics (Zhang et  al. 2021). Persaud et al. (2015), in a forecasting study of cyanobacterial dominance in Canadian  temperate lakes, summarize how effects of climate change on meteorological variables may i ncrease the geographical extent, seasonal duration, and frequency of cyanobacterial blooms  (Jöhnk et al. 2008; Paerl & Huisman 2009; Persaud et al. 2014).These meteorological variables  may be especially insightful for evaluating inter-annual trends in cyanobacterial bloom intensity,  duration, and timing (Persaud et al. 2014). Air Temperature While air temperature is broadly linked to surface water temperature globally, air and lake temperature trends diverged for many individual lakes from 1985-2009, as surface water warming rates depend not only on regional climate, but local characteristics (O’Reilly et al. 2015). On average, surface water temperatures of ice-covered lakes are warming more quickly  than lakes with no ice cover, at a rate of 0.48°C decade - 1  (O’Reilly et al. 2015). In Scandinavian l akes, cyanobacterial biomass increased in spring and early summer due to warmer winter temperatures (Weyhenmeyer 2001). Anneville et al. (2015) also found that warm winters were  associated with increased cyanobacterial abundance. The European heat wave of 2003  triggered a four-fold increase in cyanobacterial abundance in a northern European lake (Jöhnk  et al. 2008). The increased stability of the water column resulting from high temperatures  reduces vertical mixing, favoring buoyant cyanobacteria (Khan et al. 2015), including toxic  strains like Microcystis aeruginosa (Watson et al.  2015). Ho & Michalak (2020), using 1200  observations, found that summer temperatures drove total phytoplankton abundance and were  associated with increased TP concentration, and also that high temperatures may reduce the  toxicity of cyanobacterial blooms. For example, warmer spring air temperature was associated  with lower microcystin concentrations, even while cyanobacterial abundance increased. Other  researchers have also found that longer summers may result in shifts toward more nontoxic  cyanobacterial taxa (Anneville et al. 2015; Peng et al. 2018). From 2013 to 2022, average summer air temperature at the Jordan Pond House weather station  was 17.5 ± 0.7°C. Summers of 2020 and 2021 were particularly warm, with average air  temperatures of 18.4°C and 18.5°C, respectively. Average summer air temperature did not  directly mediate surface water temperature at Jordan Pond, but August air temperature had a  clearer effect on surface water temperature during a period from 2017 to 2022 (R  2 =0.86, n=5).  In August 2018, for example, average air temperature was 21.3°C and average surface water  temperature was 24°C, while in August 2020, average air temperature was 20.1°C and average  surface water temperature was 22.8°C. These results suggest that August air temperature  closely controls surface water temperature in Jordan Pond, and likely other lakes in ANP. It is  unlikely that air temperature effects on surface water temperature were responsible for higher  phycocyanin fluorescence measurements in Jordan Pond surface waters during 2020, as these  measurements occurred prior to maximum summer temperatures. Precipitation Increases in precipitation can reduce water clarity by transporting DOM from the landscape to lakes (Hongve et al. 2004; Couture et al. 2012; Williamson et al. 2014; Williamson et al. 2015;  Rose et al. 2016). In the northeastern United States, large increases in precipitation intensity  and severity have occurred since 1901 (Easterling et al. 2017), and heavy precipitation events  are expected to increase in Maine (Fernandez et al. 2020), particularly in summer months (Prein  et al. 2017). Severe precipitation events can change water pathways through watersheds and i ncrease leaching of DOM from the upper soil layer (Hongve et al. 2004), while also changing  the character of DOM in inland waters (Murshed et al. 2014). Effects of seasonal precipitation  on DOM character have been described for lakes in ANP—increases in UV-absorbing DOM  were most apparent for lakes with a large watershed area to lake area ratio after an autumn  precipitation event (Warner et al. 2020). Intense precipitation events can also increase vertical  mixing in lakes and reduce stability (Kimura et al. 2014). Increases in storms may or may not promote harmful algal blooms in lakes, as allochthonous nutrient delivery increases, but water residence time and stratification strength decrease (Paerl  & Huisman 2009; O’Neil et al. 2012; Ho & Michalak 2020; Reinl et al. 2021). Warner & Saros (2019) found evidence of increased nutrients and chlorophyll a concentration after precipitation  events in Maine drinking water lakes. In a large study of oligotrophic to eutrophic lakes across  the Northeast and Midwest United States, Wilkinson et al. (2021) described a marginal positive  trend in algal bloom magnitude in lakes experiencing intensified precipitation. If increases in late winter/early spring precipitation are followed by drought, as was observed  between the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, blooms are more likely to occur (Paerl & Huisman 2009),  as many toxin-producing cyanobacterial taxa are able to exploit and store nutrients (Jöhnk et al.  2008). Factors like light and temperature will be important determinants of bloom development.  Greater nutrient limitation in oligotrophic lakes may favor cyanobacterial dominance (Reinl et al.  2021), particularly if nutrient pulses are accompanied by increased temperature (Lürling et al.  2018). Interactions between temperature and hydrologic conditions alter the likelihood of  cyanobacterial bloom development (Jöhnk et al. 2008; Paerl & Paul 2012), so even if individual  precipitation or temperature events are not considered extreme, simultaneous changes in both  variables could create an “extreme” condition with implications for cyanobacterial bloom  development (Khan et al. 2015). At the Jordan Pond House weather station in 2020, average daily summer precipitation was 0.6  mm, compared to 1.2 ± 0.6 mm, the average daily summer rainfall from 2013-2022. In 2020,  DOC concentration, nutrient levels, and chlorophyll a in Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and  Witch Hole Pond were generally below the 1995-2020 average (with the exception of Witch  Hole Pond chlorophyll a , which was slightly above  the long-term average). Reduced DOC,  nutrient, and chlorophyll a concentrations may reflect l ower rainfall during the summer of 2020.  These results agree with findings from Warner & Saros (2019), that precipitation can affect  nutrients and chlorophyll a in Maine lakes. In rainier  years, there may be increased export of  DOM and nutrients to ANP lakes, potentially increasing the magnitude of algal blooms as  described in Wilkinson et al. (2021), especially if paired with increased temperature (Lürling et  al. 2018). For ANP lakes, the ratio of catchment area to lake area (CA:LA), catchment slope, and catchment land cover type all contribute to terrestrial DOC transport to lakes after extreme precipitation events (Fowler, unpublished data). DOC transport to ANP lakes after extreme precipitation events is greater for lakes with shallower catchment slope, as low-relief watersheds  tend to contain greater woody wetland area, which provides more DOC to lakes than any other l and cover type in ANP. Lakes with high CA:LA also experience larger pulses in DOC  concentration after storm events, as proportionally greater inputs of DOC from the catchment  affect relatively smaller lake basins. Watersheds with more deciduous, evergreen, and wetland l and cover provide more DOC to lakes than those with higher proportions of shrub-scrub,  herbaceous plants, bare ground, or developed areas (Fowler, unpublished data). This means  that Witch Hole Pond, with a CA:LA of 10 and a low-relief watershed, is likely to experience  proportionately more terrestrial DOC transport after a storm than Seal Cove Pond (CA:LA =  7.4), and especially Jordan Pond, with its relatively steep catchment area and a lower CA:LA of  6. Wind The most recent IPCC report compiled several studies that suggest wind-speed decline, or  stilling, is occurring globally at mid-latitudes (Seneviratne et al. 2021). While wind doesn’t  determine algal biomass of lakes, it can contribute to formation and severity of blooms through i mpacts on vertical distribution of algae, particularly in eutrophic lakes (Zhang et al. 2021).  Zhang et al. (2021) identified a threshold wind speed of 3 m s - 1 for the vertical distribution of  chlorophyll a concentration in three lakes, with a  negative correlation between wind speed and  floating algal bloom area. Algal bloom area doubled when wind speed declined from 3 m s - 1 to 1 m s - 1 . In this study, a shallow lake was more sensitive to reductions in wind speed. This  relationship suggests that with declining wind speeds, algal blooms may intensify in coming  decades. Lake bathymetry and wind direction data may provide clues about lake areas most susceptible  to blooms, with blooms expected to occur in downwind coves (Wynne et al. 2011; Zhang et al.  2021). In deep lakes, reductions in wind speed may lead to earlier onset and/or longer duration  of stratification, with implications for nutrient exchange with surface waters and primary  productivity. Reduced wind speed in shallow lakes may also promote earlier stratification, with  effects on nutrient dynamics partly depending on the light environment (Zhang et al. 2021).  Seasonality is also important—greater wind speeds during summer months may have less i mpact due to the strength of thermal stratification, but in the fall, windy days may speed up  turnover, promoting bloom conditions as nutrients from bottom waters are mixed through the  water column (Zhang et al. 2021). The effects of wind on lake thermal dynamics are greater in large lakes than lakes with less  surface area (  2  ), however (Fee et al. 1996).  Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, and Witch  Hole Pond are far below this threshold. For reference, the entire watershed area for Jordan  Pond is about 5 km 2 . In smaller lakes, water transparency i s a larger driver of thermal structure  than wind (Read et al. 2012). Jordan Pond (and several other lakes in ANP) have relatively long  fetches, however, due to their long and narrow shape, a result of glacial movement across the l andscape. In these lakes, strong winds might weaken stratification and/or deepen the  thermocline, while reductions in wind could have the opposite effect, leading to a shallower  thermocline with more stable stratification, favoring buoyant cyanobacteria (Jöhnk et al. 2008). In the summer of 2020, mean (1.6 m s - 1 ) and maximum  wind speed (1.6 m s - 1 ) at the Jordan  Pond House weather station were similar to the 2013 to 2022 averages, 1.7 ± 0.1 m s - 1 and 2.1  ± 0.1 m s - 1 , respectively. Wind speed remained relatively  unchanged during this period. These  wind speeds are below the 3 m s - 1 threshold described  by Zhang et al. (2021), indicating that  wind speed could contribute to algal bloom area. However, the lakes in Zhang et al. (2021) were  all eutrophic, in contrast to the lakes in our study, so it is reasonable to expect that relatively low  wind speed in ANP would have much less impact on bloom area if an algal bloom were to  develop in any of the lakes. However, low wind speed might be more likely to support earlier  stratification in a shallow lake like Witch Hole Pond than in a deep lake like Jordan Pond. During the period of stratification, wind in ANP often comes from the south and/or west. As Jordan Pond (Figure 18) and Seal Cove Pond (Figure 19) are aligned on a north-south axis, they may be more vulnerable to formation of cyanobacteria surface scums on shallow northern  or eastern edges. The shallow east edges of the northern and southern basins in Seal Cove  Pond might be particularly susceptible as they are bottle-necked from the deeper and wider  central basin. Witch Hole Pond (Figure 20), smaller in surface area and shallower, is tilted on a  southwest-northeast axis, and is likely more vulnerable to surface scums of cyanobacteria on its  northern and eastern edges. Ice-Out Timing & Seasonality Lakes in Maine are sensitive to warm winter and spring temperature, and ice-out in Maine lakes is linked to winter degree day thresholds (Beyene & Jain 2015). Temporal synchrony in ice-out of Maine lakes is high, and ice-out has been occurring earlier in the year since the mid-20 t h  century (Hodgkins et al. 2002; Boeff et al. 2016; Ellis & Greene 2019), and is related to the number of accumulated freezing and melting degree days in January and February (Beyenne &  Jain 2015). Especially for lakes near the coast, such as those in ANP, the occurrence and  magnitude of average monthly nonfreezing winter degree days has a strong effect on ice-out  dates (Beyene & Jain 2015). Warner et al. (2018) described the effect of ice-out timing on  thermal structure in Jordan Pond in ANP—with earlier ice-off, mixing depth in Jordan Pond was  shallower. Ice-out trends in ANP lakes may affect HAB formation due to availability of nutrients,  water temperature, and DO. For example, in 2012, early ice-out in Maine lakes led to a  prolonged duration of thermal stratification, resulting in severe anoxia and P release from  sediments. Lake-wide harmful algal blooms then developed in Lake Auburn and Georges Pond (Amirbahman et al. 2016). As described in Reinl et al. (2021), many oligotrophic lakes are located in higher latitudes with  colder climates (Alin & Johnson 2007), where ice cover extent and duration is expected to  decrease (Sharma et al. 2015). Temporal coherence in ice-off dates has been documented in  Maine and New England (Hodgkins et al. 2002; Beyene & Jain 2015; Boeff et al. 2016) and the  Laurentian Great Lakes region (Magnuson et al. 2005). O’Reilly et al. (2015) found that lake  morphology is another important factor in the response of ice-covered lake warming to ambient  air temperature. For example, the world’s deepest ice-covered lakes have warmed twice as fast  as overlying air temperatures. In these lakes, shorter ice duration due to later freeze and earlier i ce break-up are affected by temperatures in preceding months (Magnuson 2000), and i ncreasing air temperature can lead to earlier onset of stratification and surface waters warming more rapidly than the air (Austin & Colman 2007). Surface water temperature more closely  tracks air temperature in smaller, shallower lakes (Toffolon et al. 2014). Richardson et al. (2017) explained that for Northeastern North American (NENA) lakes and l akes in northern latitudes, warmer winters with less ice cover and less snow cover on ice will  become more common (Magnuson et al. 2000; Hodgkins et al. 2002), lake albedo will decline,  stratification onset will occur earlier, the duration of radiation absorption will lengthen, and  summer warming will intensify (Austin & Colman 2007; O’Reilly et al. 2015; Zhong et al. 2016).  Lakes at higher latitudes (i.e. >44°N in Richardson et al. 2017), experience the fastest increases i n the strength of thermal stratification and lake warming rates. Because higher latitudes are  projected to have the greatest increases in air temperature warming on the coldest days (Seneviratne et al. 2021), lake surface temperatures in these areas may warm similarly,  resulting in stronger density gradients between lake strata and changes in the phenology of ice  dynamics, like earlier break-up (Richardson et al. 2017). Changing winter weather will likely have important implications for oxygen dynamics. Warmer winter temperatures and earlier ice-off may have variable effects on hypolimnetic oxygen concentration (Nelligan et al. 2019). Earlier onset of summer stratification can stretch the period  between seasonal mixing events and intensify oxygen depletion (Stainsby et al. 2011; Perello et  al. 2017). However, earlier ice-off may reduce winter anoxia by shortening the duration of  under-ice oxygen depletion (Agbeti & Smol 1994; Fang & Stefan 2009). Perello et al. (2017) monitored water temperature and DO to compare weather patterns with stratification and DO  trends in Lake Erie, which has experienced declining lake ice since 1973 (Wang et al. 2012). In  2012, increased storm events corresponded to less ice coverage, warm water temperature, and l ow DO concentrations, with a deeper and thinner hypolimnion. Reduced ice cover allows for earlier wind mixing of the upper water layer, causing the hypolimnion to become deeper and  thinner. In Maine lakes with lower DOC concentrations, it is likely that thermoclines will shallow as temperatures warm and ice-cover duration shortens. As the thermocline shallows, the area  below the epilimnion will increase, and deep, low-DOC lakes will become more susceptible to anoxia (Deeds et al. 2021). Risk Assessment Early Warning Indicators In multivariate, whole-ecosystem time series, like those of a lake over the course of one or several seasons, there are cases where temporal or spatial early warning indicators (EWIs) of cyanobacterial blooms, also called resilience indicators, have preceded breakpoints in ecosystem state variables (e.g. chlorophyll a concentration,  phycocyanin, or dissolved oxygen; Pace et al. 2017; Butitta et al. 2017). For example, time series from automated sensors  anticipated a cyanobacterial bloom in a whole-lake experiment (Pace et al. 2017). However, in several studies, state variables did not reflect EWI trends or they failed to respond concurrently  (Burthe et al. 2016; Gsell et al. 2016; Spears et al. 2017; Rohde et al. 2022). Numerous i nteracting drivers (light, temperature, nutrients, etc.) can affect cyanobacterial bloom  development, so it is likely that varying environmental conditions damper early warning i ndicators that could signal cyanobacterial blooms (Wilkinson et al. 2021). Buelo et al. (2022)  expressed the need for system-specific examples to quantify the likelihood of regime shifts (from a clear-water to a cyanobacterial bloom state, for example). No substitutes exist for site-specific knowledge and experiments (Dakos et al. 2015). Often, indicators are only detected i n retrospect or while state transitions are occurring, or ecosystems have such a narrow range  of variability that changes in EWIs might not be useful for predictive purpose (Van Nes &  Scheffer 2007). Even with the variable success of using early warning indicators to predict ecosystem state  changes in complex limnological conditions, there is consensus about the value of making  estimates and analyzing trends for determining baseline indicator values (Dakos et al. 2015). A  deviating trend from baseline values could forecast a transition in ecosystem state (Bestelmeyer  et al. 2011; Peters et al. 2013; Wilkinson et al. 2018), although trends could still be noisy and  difficult to interpret, and sometimes too unclear to initiate management action (Dakos et al.  2015). For example, managers can estimate how close a system is to a threshold based on  ecosystem variable baselines, and then rank the vulnerability of systems at any given time to  make management decisions. Thresholds for concern and/or action for cyanobacterial blooms  can be created based on ecosystem variables like chlorophyll a , phycocyanin, and dissolved  oxygen (Pace et al. 2017), and “resilience maps,” or estimates of resilience, can be used to  prioritize management of different systems, although even in best-case scenarios, surprises in  ecosystem state can occur with no warning (Dakos et al. 2015). High-frequency water quality  monitoring and longer-term sampling will improve managers’ confidence in baseline data and  subsequent management decisions. To be able to support decision-making, resilience indicators  must be assessed in the context of ecological understanding of individual systems (Rohde et al. 2022). Implications for HABs Vulnerability Water quality conditions are difficult to forecast due to variability of water quality metrics outside  baseline conditions, which puts tremendous strain on resource managers (Brookes et al. 2014;  Khan et al. 2015; Carey et al. 2022). Regime shifts can occur with an abrupt transition from a  clear-water state to an algal-dominated state (Scheffer et al. 2009) and impending regime shifts  may sometimes be detected by frequent monitoring of water quality variables that could  represent a shift to algal dominance, like chlorophyll a , phycocyanin, and dissolved oxygen  saturation (Batt et al. 2013; Sirota et al. 2013; Ortiz et al. 2020). With predictions of increased  water column stability with lake warming (Woolway et al. 2020), and of increased frequency and  severity of storms, physical lake conditions may shift toward supporting cyanobacterial growth  across a gradient of lake trophic states (Reinl et al. 2021). The resilience of similar systems may  be ranked by estimating resilience indicators of the systems (Scheffer et al. 2015). Resilience as  an indicator is relative and qualitative as opposed to absolute and quantitative because the  dynamics of systems are complex and it is difficult to account for seasonal trends in time series  of individual systems. Long-term monitoring provides baseline information about the stability of i ndividual systems and can be used to discern whether a system is losing or gaining resilience  (Scheffer et al. 2015). Risk Assessment Scorecard The risk assessment scorecard (Figure 21) supports our predictions based on water quality  sampling that lakes like Jordan Pond have the fewest risk factors to future HAB development, while lakes like Witch Hole Pond have more risk factors and may be more vulnerable to  developing HABs in the future. Lakes like Jordan Pond (Long Pond, Eagle Lake, Bubble Pond, Upper Breakneck Pond) Oligotrophic lakes may be more resilient to processes like internal P loading that could trigger cyanobacterial blooms in other lakes (Orihel et al. 2017), and this heightened resilience may improve the chances of detecting an impending regime shift before it occurs (Ortiz et al. 2020). As we observed in phycocyanin data from 2020, surface aggregations and metalimnetic maxima of cyanobacteria can occur in oligotrophic lakes (Lofton et al. 2020), and although cyanobacteria in oligotrophic lakes may have low average biomass, even ephemeral surface blooms could  present concerns for recreation or taste and odor of drinking water (Reinl et al. 2021). Deep l akes (>25 m) like Jordan Pond might be more resilient to anoxic conditions (Deeds et al. 2021), which is especially important with a declining proportion of oligotrophic lakes across the landscape (Stoddard et al. 2016). According to Wagner & Adrian (2009), certain water quality  thresholds, including stable stratification that lasts longer than three weeks and a TP range between 70 to 125 µg L - 1 , must be crossed for cyanobacterial bloom formers like Aphanizomenon, Dolichospermum, and Microcystis to dominate. While Jordan Pond and many  other lakes in Acadia National Park stratify stably for >3 weeks each summer, none of the  Northeast Temperate Network (NETN) lakes in ANP meet the TP criteria (Gawley & Wiggin  2016). Average Secchi depth in Jordan Pond has shallowed slightly since 1995, with a more  notable shallowing trend since 2011. DOC has increased slightly, likely as a result of the  successful Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and subsequent effects on lake-landscape l inkages. Nutrients, particularly TN, have decreased in Jordan Pond since 1995, while chlorophyll a has generally remained unchanged. These long-term data suggest that while  Jordan Pond may be more at risk due to climate factors, Jordan Pond and similar ANP lakes l ikely have high resilience to cyanobacterial blooms and low risk for HABs. However, in the last decade, Gloeotrichia echinulata , a type of colonial cyanobacteria that produces the toxin microcystin-LR, has been increasing in low-nutrient Maine lakes. The reasons for Gloeotrichia increases in low-nutrient lakes are unclear (Carey et al. 2012b), so it is important to be aware that Gloeotrichia may become  problematic in lakes like Jordan Pond that  have few risk factors for other HAB-forming cyanobacteria. Lakes like Seal Cove Pond (Echo Lake, Lake Wood, Upper Hadlock Pond, Lower Hadlock Pond, Lower Breakneck Pond, Aunt Betty Pond, Bear Brook Pond) Historical data show a declining trend in TP and TN in Seal Cove Pond since 1995, with a relatively stable TN:TP ratio (Figure 16). DOC, chl a , and Secchi have also maintained relatively  stable averages since 1995. As an oligo-mesotrophic lake that stratifies, of moderate depth and  flushing rate, Seal Cove Pond and similar lakes are likely at moderate risk of potential future HAB development. Three of the lakes (Lake Wood, Aunt Betty Pond, and Bear Brook Pond) in this moderate risk category do not stratify and have relatively fast flushing rates, so even though they are shallow and meso-eutrophic, we place them in the same risk category as Seal Cove Pond. Lakes like Witch Hole Pond (Round Pond, Hodgdon Pond, Seawall Pond) In shallow lakes that stratify (e.g. ≤8 m in Wagner & Adrian 2009), cyanobacteria may have easier access to the high nutrient concentrations in the hypolimnion (Carey et al. 2012a). Lakes in this category of considerable risk are shallow, meso-eutrophic, may or may not stratify, and  have moderate flushing rates. They are likely more prone to and less resilient to internal nutrient l oading as a result of anoxic conditions. Since 1995, Secchi depth, chl a concentration, and  TN:TP have remained relatively stable in Witch Hole Pond, while DOC, TN, and TP have  declined. If regular monitoring of Witch Hole Pond revealed that Secchi depth, chl a , and/or TP  surpassed the historical 75% quantile values (2.8 m, 4.7 µg L - 1 , 11 µg L - 1 , respectively; Table 2), resource managers might consider that Witch Hole Pond could be losing resilience, which could precede a switch to an alternative state, such as HAB development (Scheffer et al. 2001). In response to a driver like nutrient loading, shallow lakes may exhibit pronounced hysteresis, while deeper lakes often have greater resilience and respond more smoothly (Carpenter et al.1999). In eutrophic systems, abrupt shifts (also referred to as critical transitions) can occur in  response to small changes in the system (Carpenter et al. 1999; Batt et al. 2013; Cottingham et  al. 2015; Buelo et al. 2018). While the widespread intensification of algal blooms in response to the effects of climate change  and eutrophication has been hypothesized (Elliott 2012, O’Neil et al. 2012, Chapra et al. 2017),  other evidence shows different patterns (Kraemer et al. 2017; Wilkinson et al. 2021). Oliver et al.  (2017) did not find a widespread increase in chlorophyll a and nutrient concentration in a large  study of lakes in the Northeast United States, and Wilkinson et al. (2021) showed that smaller lakes are more likely to have negative trends in algal bloom magnitude and severity, especially those that benefited from restoration and protection by the Clean Water Act of 1972. Following these findings, lakes within ANP, even those we have placed in the category of considerable  risk, may have an extra layer of protection from HAB formation and development as a result of the long-term water quality monitoring by ANP resource managers. Recommendations Management Options Due to a long evolutionary history, the adaptability and tolerance of blooming cyanobacterial  taxa to short-term (diel, seasonal, decadal) and long-term (geological) environmental pressures l ike climate change make cyanobacteria a “group for all seasons” (Paerl 2001). The most  successful management strategies will likely incorporate multi-level responses to potential future  HABs (Watson et al. 2015), as ANP manages for change, not just for persistence (Schuurman  ANP Science Symposium 2021). Within the Resist-Accept-Direct decision framework (Fisichelli et al. 2016b; Schuurman et al.  2020), a range of management options exist for managers of lakes that may experience or are  currently experiencing HABs. In cases where it is decided that no action will be taken to shape  the trajectory of change, the decision to “Accept” is selected. If management action will be taken  to preserve a historical condition, the management decision is to “Resist.” The decision to “Direct” is made when the desired outcome is to create a new set of conditions (Schuurman et  al. 2020). Our goal is to identify possible management approaches within the RAD framework  based on lake vulnerability to HABs, and to present these recommendations clearly. Selection ofmanagement approaches will depend on the NPS mission, goals of ANP resource managers,  stakeholder preferences, societal values, and specific desired outcomes. The best approaches  will be manager-centered, simple, and intuitive (Schuurman 2021). For lakes with some level of vulnerability to HABs or that are of special importance to resource  managers and stakeholders, but are not currently experiencing HAB conditions, the “Accept”  decision framework could include targeted monitoring programs and public communication and  outreach. For lakes with active HABs, the “Resist” approach could incorporate management  strategies like external nutrient control, algaecide application, internal nutrient manipulation,  de-stratification through mixing or aeration, or biological control (Watson et al. 2015). Ideally, the  outcomes of decision-making approaches will be shared collaboratively to support management  decisions as issues with freshwater HABs arise across NPS units. For example, in recent years  Isle Royale National Park has posted advisories warning visitors not to drink or recreate in lakes  affected by HABs, along with educational descriptions of HAB appearance, causes, and impacts  on humans, animals, and the ecosystem. This form of visitor communication is an example of  an “Accept” approach. It aims to protect the health and safety of visitors, but does not reduce  the magnitude of HABs or restore lakes to historical, pre-HAB conditions Resist Returning lakes to pre-HAB conditions, when possible, can be burdensome and expensive, and  resulting impacts on other aspects of the ecosystem may be difficult to predict or control. HAB  and non-HAB assemblages often include overlapping populations of various growth stages that  are regulated by factors with spatial and temporal heterogeneity (e.g. light, nutrients, seeding,  cell division, grazing; Watson et al. 2015). Management decisions based on measures of  biovolume, chlorophyll  a  or other pigments, or cell  counts may be inefficient because these  metrics can vary widely across time and space and may be uncoupled from HAB conditions (Harris 1980; Watson et al. 2015). However, several management strategies exist as short-term  responses for reducing exposure to and minimizing health impacts of HABs (Watson et al.  2015). While the best long-term management approach is prevention of HABs (Paerl et al.  2001), management approaches are also available for sustained reduction of HAB frequency  and severity (Watson et al. 2015). A long-term approach is to reduce external nutrient loads through watershed and in-lake nutrient  management. This approach is the most practical and cost-effective strategy for reducing HABs  (Paerl et al. 2001; Watson et al. 2015; Buelo et al. 2018). Examples of this approach include  reductions of detergent- and sewage-based P inputs. Most of the lakes in ANP are fully  protected from these sorts of nutrient inputs. Other sources of nutrient inputs could include  shoreline erosion, which may vary with trail usage near the lake and within the watershed, and  type and amount of vegetation in the watershed. In ANP, climate change effects like increasing  temperature and increasing frequency and intensity of storms are impacting the habitat  suitability for many tree species and thus forest composition (Fisichelli et al. 2013). These shifts i n forest composition will have implications for the timing and magnitude of pulses of nutrients  transferred from the landscape to lakes. HAB magnitude may be tied to the severity of extreme  precipitation events, particularly in eutrophic lakes (Wilkinson et al. 2021). In these cases,  resource managers may want to consider strategies for minimizing nutrient inputs from the  watershed and methods for reducing storm-induced internal loading via sediment resuspension (Wilkinson et al. 2021). However, most external nutrient inputs come from nonpoint sources,  and are difficult or impossible for resource managers to control (Pace et al. 2017). The safest  management approach for freshwater HABs is to protect the resilience of desirable conditions  by regulating external nutrient loads to lakes and maintaining a “safe operating space” for lake  processes (Pace et al. 2017). Other approaches to control freshwater HABs vary by lake type and desired outcomes, or if the l ake is a source of drinking water. The depth at which drinking water is extracted may be altered  (Carey et al. 2022), or toxin removal from drinking water may be necessary (Dugan et al. 2018).  Algaecides like copper sulfate (Paerl et al. 2001) and hydrogen peroxide (Reinl et al. 2021)  have been used to target nuisance algae (Buelo et al. 2018). In addition, magnetic coagulants  (Liu et al. 2013) and ultrasound (Wu et al. 2011) have been used to influence algal community  composition and inhibit cyanobacterial growth, respectively (Pace et al. 2017; Reinl et al. 2021).  Depending on internal nutrient conditions and the sensitivity of a lake to developing naturally-occurring anoxia, artificial aeration of the hypolimnion or chemical treatments for the  precipitation of P from the water column may be suitable management approaches (Deeds et al.  2021). Vertical destratification through mechanical mixing or aeration can reduce the  competitive advantage of cyanobacteria for light and nutrients (Paerl et al. 2001; Visser et al.  2016). Enhanced water flushing to reduce retention time, while costly, may be plausible in  systems with abundant upstream reservoirs (Paerl et al. 2001; Watson et al. 2015; Paerl et al.  2018). Accept Monitoring Approaches The Air & Water Program at ANP has a decades-long legacy of air and water quality monitoring.  Long-term continuous monitoring is essential for understanding ecosystem processes and  detection of early warning indicators of ecosystem change (Dakos et al. 2015; Burthe et al.  2016), like HAB development. Highly-resolved temporal and spatial data are most useful for  making informed and effective management decisions (Rohde et al. 2022), particularly for  drinking water sources (Wilkinson et al. 2018), but the monitoring burden required to correlate  HABs with specific environmental drivers may be implausible (Ho & Michalak 2020). It is i mportant to balance sampling frequency across lakes to capture potential HAB dynamics with  realistic expectations of ANP staff and resource allocation (e.g. Wilkinson et al. 2021). Based on the ranking of lakes on the Risk Assessment Scorecard, we suggest integrating sustainable, easily repeatable, and easy-to-implement steps into the current Air & Water monitoring program. We recommend that resource managers direct monitoring efforts to shallow meso- and  eutrophic lakes like Seal Cove Pond and Witch Hole Pond, particularly during mid- to late-summer when water temperature is high and dissolved oxygen is low, and into the fall,  when high wind speeds accelerate the breakdown of thermal stratification and internal nutrients  from sediments could be mixed into the water column. Additionally, as Gloeotrichia is increasing i n oligotrophic lakes across Maine, we recommend routine monitoring for Gloeotrichia colonies in Jordan Pond (and other oligotrophic lakes if possible) beginning in early June. Another water quality parameter to examine more closely in routine monitoring is phycocyanin  fluorescence. Phycocyanin is a photosynthetic cyanobacterial pigment. Phycocyanin  fluorescence gives a relative estimate of cyanobacterial abundance, and can be measured by the total algae sensor on the EXO used in current monitoring protocols. Sometimes calibration  of the total algae sensor can present problems with data accuracy. If calibration of the total  algae sensor is a concern, a handheld fluorometer may be purchased relatively inexpensively,  and can be used temporarily or on a longer-term basis to compare surface water phycocyanin  trends with measurements from the EXO sensor. Recording monthly phycocyanin  measurements throughout the water column of ANP lakes will be important for developing  baselines for each lake. After a few seasons of regular phycocyanin measurements, data points  that fall outside the 75 t h  percentile may trigger  additional sampling. High frequency (hourly to daily) phycocyanin monitoring would capture periods of high risk that  are missed by monthly sampling (McQuaid et al. 2011), particularly after extreme precipitation  events that may increase nutrient loading from the landscape (Heisler et al. 2008). High-frequency phycocyanin sensor data, similar to that recorded by sensors attached to the Jordan Pond Buoy, would help managers decide when/if to perform cyanotoxin sampling, issue  public advisories, and/or alter drinking water intakes (McQuaid et al. 2011; Wong & Hobbs  2020). High-frequency monitoring equipment can be costly and requires extra time and effort  from staff for annual set-up, take-down, maintenance, and troubleshooting, and so decision-makers would need to consider on which lake(s) and on what timeline the installation  of high-frequency monitoring equipment would be most informative. When selecting lakes, we  recommend prioritizing drinking water sources, lakes of great recreational value, and/or lakes  ranked at “considerable” risk for HAB development. Inferences about phycocyanin dynamics  may be made about un-instrumented lakes with similar water quality and morphometric  characteristics. In addition to increasing the temporal resolution of sampling, increasing the spatial resolution of  sampling would capture more of the spatial heterogeneity of water quality parameters in lakes  (Duggan et al. 2018; Woolway et al. 2020). Spatial heterogeneity is common in lakes, and i nstead of sampling only the deepest point in the lake, broader spatial sampling would improve  our understanding of lake-wide algal dynamics and ability to identify and detect early warning i ndicators of HABs (Rohde et al. 2022). One relatively inexpensive method of increasing spatial  resolution of sampling is increasing the number of temperature and DO strings deployed in l akes. Pace et al. (2017) recommend collecting samples not only in the deep holes of lakes, but  also near areas closer to shore or in expected algal hotspots (Molot et al. 2014; Ortiz et al.  2020). For example, the northern and eastern edges of Jordan Pond, both basins of Seal Cove  Pond, and Witch Hole Pond would be desirable areas for sampling, as these areas may be  more vulnerable to HAB development. Another method for increasing spatial and temporal data collection is to broaden winter sampling of ANP lakes. For example, ice phenology (ice-on and ice-out dates, and the interval  and ice dynamics between), which impacts many aspects of algal community structure, could be  recorded with on-site time-lapse cameras for select lakes (Couture et al. 2015; Carey et al.  2022). In addition, continuous under-ice sensor monitoring would provide data on spring  phytoplankton blooms that are often missed with traditional sampling methods (Hampton et al.  2017; Ortiz et al. 2020). A multi-pronged approach to data collection (i.e. high-frequency in-situ buoy measurements, l ong-term water column sampling, nutrient limitation experiments, and paleolimnology) has been  valuable for understanding ecological dynamics in Jordan Pond and other ANP lakes (e.g. Daggett et al. 2015; Strock et al. 2017; Malik et al. 2018; Warner et al. 2018; Fowler et al. 2022).  Collecting sediment samples for eDNA analysis would provide key information about which  cyanobacterial taxa are present in each lake and would complement the risk assessment  scorecard developed in this project. Because cyanobacterial taxa respond differently to effects  of climate resulting in changes to stratification and nutrient loading (Carey et al. 2012a), better  understanding which taxa are present in ANP lakes will improve HAB forecasting. Although identifying early warning indicators of HABs is easier to do post hoc than in real-time  (Pace et al. 2017), it may be beneficial to lake managers to develop a system for receiving  alerts when monthly data points for key water quality variables (e.g. Secchi, temperature, DO,  phycocyanin, chl  a  ) exceed the 75 t h  percentile. This  alert would trigger an examination of the  data to verify the exceedance, followed by a decision-making process for when/if to re-sample,  publish an advisory for ANP visitors, collect water samples for cyanobacterial identification  and/or toxin analysis, and/or redirect water intakes away from surface or metalimnetic blooms  (Reinl et al. 2021). Assuming increases in early warning indicators appear days or weeks before  a critical transition (Ortiz et al. 2020), these alerts could give lake managers time to decide upon  a course of action (Wilkinson et al. 2018). Seasonal or annual comparisons of key water quality  parameters for each lake paired with a summary report illustrating trends will inform education  and outreach efforts. Communication, Education, & Outreach Air & Water Quality Program scientists at ANP began contributing  to the nationwide  Cyanobacteria Monitoring Collaborative programs bloomWatch and Cyanoscope, and have  since initiated SPATT sampling (a form of cyanotoxin tracking) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in  Jordan Pond, Lake Wood, and Upper Hadlock Pond. In the past decade, Jordan Pond Buoy  outreach projects like the interactive kiosk in the Jordan Pond House and social media  communications have inspired curiosity about ANP lakes in thousands of in-person and virtual  visitors worldwide. Expanding citizen science across ANP will amplify visitors’ awareness of  ANP lake science. A display about HABs at the Sieur de Monts Nature Center Spring, for  example, could spur visitors’ interest in freshwater algal dynamics at ANP. Across New England, several states have developed HABs advisories based on water  transparency, cell counts, pigments, and/or taxonomy (Bacon 2016). ANP managers can learn  from and adapt these states’ protocols to prepare for, measure, track, and respond to potential  HAB conditions. For example, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) maintains a  “Lake Information Mapper” GIS tool that allows users to view cyanobacterial bloom history of i ndividual lakes. The NHDES Cyanobacterial HAB Program issues both advisories and alerts for individual waterbodies. An advisory report is issued when cyanobacteria cell concentrations  reach >70,000 cells ml - 1  or >50% of a sample is cyanobacteria  (NHDES 2022). Advisories may  be issued between May 15 and October 15, and resampling is performed weekly until the bloom  subsides. Alerts can be issued on the basis of a photograph before water samples can be  analyzed, or if a water sample has cyanobacterial cell concentrations approaching >70,000 cells  ml - 1  . Alerts, which may be issued year-round as needed,  are valid for one week, and may turn i nto advisories or may expire if the bloom passes (NHDES 2022). Cyanobacterial HAB  advisories and alerts are updated daily on the Healthy Swimming Mapper, an integrative tool  that allows users to track alerts and advisories spatially and temporally. Similarly, the Vermont Department of Health and Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) developed the “Vermont Cyanobacteria Tracker,” a GIS tool that gives the most current  cyanobacterial reports for a given lake, along with photos of the bloom and a table with that l ake’s bloom history for the current year (Vermont Department of Health 2023). Within ANP, communicating with visitors about risk management and resource closures will be i mportant for protecting visitor safety and minimizing future HAB-related illness or injury. These  forms of communication could take the form of online alerts and virtual notifications through  nps.gov and posted signage at affected lakes. As various stakeholders access ANP lakes for  various uses, these communications should include risk levels and recommendations for a  variety of resource uses. For example, is the risk of skin irritation from cyanotoxins high enough  that swimmers should be directed to another area? Should anglers avoid skin contact with the  water? Communication and collaboration with community organizations like local homeowner and conservation groups will be important for communicating risks and recommendations to the public and motivating public awareness and support for lake protection from future HABs. Identifying potential stakeholders to include in a “HABs awareness and support” network and then providing regular summaries of water quality monitoring and implications for public use will  advance ANP outreach and education efforts. For example, homeowners on Hodgdon Pond  have voiced concern about water level fluctuations due to beaver activity and culverts. As  Hodgdon Pond is also at considerable risk of future HABs, these homeowners would ideally be i ncluded in conversations about HABs risks, in which they might also share their own long- or  short-term observations and knowledge about ecological changes in Hodgdon Pond. Similar  conversations with homeowners and anglers on Seal Cove Pond, a popular sport fishing lake at  moderate risk of future HABs, could provide valuable information for ANP resource managers  and a variety of stakeholders. Maine Coast Heritage Trust (MCHT) supports a range of i nitiatives for increasing resilience of coastal Maine resources to climate change and works to  foster connections among communities, groups, and individuals interested in preserving and  protecting these resources. While MCHT is a land conservation organization, its ongoing  support of outdoor recreation, watershed protection and water access, and experience with  community outreach could make it a valuable local partner for advancing awareness among  shared stakeholders. Limitations & Future Work A strength of this project is its multi-faceted approach to data collection, including historical water and air quality records, long-term continuous buoy data, and a season of targeted water quality sampling to address questions specific to this project. The targeted water quality sampling during the spring, summer, and fall of 2020 illuminated important information about  water quality metrics in lakes of different trophic states to better understand their vulnerability to  HABs. This sort of targeted sampling, including continuous temperature and dissolved oxygen  sensor measurements and biweekly water column measurements of chlorophyll a ,  phycocyanin,  and nutrients, would be even more useful if expanded to subsequent years and sample sites.  For example, a 5- or 10-year dataset including more lakes of varying morphometry, flushing  rates, and trophic states would allow us to further tailor risk assessments to specific lakes in  ANP. For the purpose of delivering realistic recommendations for management planning, we have tried to balance precision across ANP lakes with generalized assumptions about lake  types in ANP based on trophic status and level of protection. Due to the challenges of launching a research project at the beginning of 2020, measurements  of phycocyanin and chlorophyll  a immediately after i ce-off are missing from the Witch Hole Pond  dataset. We expect that, similar to Jordan Pond and Seal Cove Pond, there was elevated  phycocyanin in surface waters at this time, but it would be useful to collect data immediately  after ice-off to support these assumptions. We are also missing phytoplankton cell density  counts from Witch Hole Pond for the 2020 season, which would help us understand whether  HAB-forming cyanobacterial taxa were present in Witch Hole Pond in 2020. Regardless, this  gap in data does not change our conclusions about the vulnerability of Witch Hole Pond to  future HABs. Winter water quality monitoring would also help fill a gap in understanding about the likelihood  of HAB formation and persistence. The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON)  and others have recently shown the importance of snow and ice dynamics on dissolved oxygen, l ight availability, thermal structure, phytoplankton community structure, and nutrient levels  throughout the winter and in subsequent seasons (Beall et al. 2016; Hrycik & Stockwell 2021;  Jansen et al. 2021; Hrycik et al. 2022). Winter monitoring is of the highest importance  considering the dramatic changes in snow and ice cover on temperate and boreal lakes (Ozersky et al. 2021), particularly in ANP and throughout Maine (Beyene & Jain 2015; Boeff et  al. 2016; Warner et al. 2018). More comprehensive identification of cyanobacterial taxa would be useful in future projects. With the exception of Dolichospermum i n Seal Cove  Pond during a spring sampling event, the lakes in this project were largely absent of toxin-producing cyanobacterial taxa. However, Microcystis may have been too small to identify microscopically. Environmental DNA (eDNA) and sediment DNA (sedDNA) will be important tools for identifying which toxin-producing cyanobacteria taxa are present in water samples and putting these results in the context of historical change. The University of Maine has a Water Resources Research Institute (WRRI)-funded eDNA project for investigating how warming winters over the past 125 years have impacted HAB-forming cyanobacteria in Maine lakes. eDNA has already been used to identify Dolichospermum as one of the toxin-producing  taxa in an August 2020 HAB event in Damariscotta Lake (Bartow 2023). Furthermore, in this study we had no measure for whether phycocyanin concentration was correlated with toxicity. It is difficult to predict if and when an algal bloom will become harmful, as  not all toxin-producing taxa produce toxins in all conditions, and the amounts of toxins may vary  with light, temperature, and nutrients (Otten & Paerl 2015; Wurtsbaugh et al. 2019). A lack of l ong-term cyanobacterial bloom data restricts our interpretations of the limited data researchers  have collected (Ho & Michalak 2017). Contributions to the Cyanobacteria Monitoring  Collaborative programs bloomWatch and Cyanoscope, as well as SPATT sampling (a form of  toxin tracking) and qPCR analysis in select lakes will improve our understanding of conditions  precluding potential future HABs in ANP lakes. If concerns arise within particular lakes, water  samples could be sent to labs for testing of specific cyanobacterial toxins. The Maine DEP has  been testing water from lakes in Maine for microcystins since 2008.

(WDBJ) - With cold weather here, going to the lake may not be top of mind. But the Smith Mountain Lake Association is asking for your to help to tackle harmful algal bloom before summer returns. Preparations are underway at the Smith Mountain Lake Association for the upcoming year, marked by a fervent focus on addressing potential harmful algal blooms that afflicted the lake during the previous season. “We’re very busy behind the scenes, preparing for what could be another season of harmful algal blooms at Smith Mountain Lake,” stated Lake Quality Council Chair Keri Green. Last summer, the lake grappled with harmful algal blooms for the first time, resulting in the closure of the Blackwater River Arm portion for months. Since then, more questions than answers have surfaced. “Where are those nutrients coming from? Why are these blooms lasting so long? Those are the questions we’re aiming to answer in the spring,” explained Green. A primary effort to combat the problem involves establishing a Harmful Algal Bloom Lab, equipped with necessary tools to identify and test cyanobacteria commonly found in these blooms. This initiative aims to reduce the time taken for delayed sampling. “We’ll be collecting samples once every other week at our docks, all year round,” added Green. However, they need your support to make this initiative a reality. “It’s going to take us some time to get geared up. We need to train our volunteers, purchase supplies, and raise funds. That’s why we’ve launched our first-ever fundraising campaign, called ‘Make a Splash,’” shared Green. Their inaugural campaign invites residents, visitors, and businesses to contribute to keeping the lake clean and safe. “We’re looking to enhance safety, educational outreach, and water quality monitoring,” emphasized Green. The association is also in talks with members of the general assembly, aiming to secure funding from the Governor’s budget for a state study of the lake. If successful, they hope Virginia Tech will lead this study to understand and resolve the issue of these blooms. Click here to donate. Copyright 2023 WDBJ. All rights reserved.

This is in response to a water sample taken on February 20, 2024 . The public should exercise caution in and around Lake Minnehaha. Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to begin doing so remains poorly understood. For this reason, it is important to exercise caution, as bloom conditions are dynamic and could change at any time. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) collects algae samples from reported bloom locations for toxin analysis. Once completed, the results will be posted on the FDEP Algal Bloom Dashboard , and can also be viewed on the Protecting Florida Together website, where you can sign up to be notified of the latest conditions. Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Wash your skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with algae or discolored or smelly water. Keep pets away from the area. Waters where there are algae blooms are not safe for animals. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water when algae blooms are present. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae blooms. Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is safe. Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish to the appropriate temperature. Do not eat shellfish in waters with algae blooms. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals. For additional information on potential health effects of algal blooms, visit floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/aquatic-toxins. Find current information about Florida’s water quality status and public health notifications for harmful algal blooms and beach conditions by visiting ProtectingFloridaTogether.gov . Protecting Florida Together is the state’s joint effort to provide statewide water quality information to prioritize environmental transparency and commitment to action . What do I do if I see an algal bloom? The Florida Department of Environmental Protection collects and analyzes algal bloom samples. To report a bloom to FDEP, call the toll-free hotline at 855-305-3903 or report online . To report fish kills, contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute at 1-800-636-0511. Report symptoms from exposure to a harmful algal bloom or any aquatic toxin to the Florida Poison Information Center, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak to a poison specialist immediately. Contact your veterinarian if you believe your pet has become ill after consuming or having contact with blue-green algae contaminated water.

The bloom was thought to have spread across 380 square miles of the lake as of June 12. It is Florida's largest freshwater lake, and the 10th-largest natural freshwater lake in the U.S. This algal bloom equated to an area of more than half the lake's 734-square-mile surface. It can be seen from space as pictures taken by NASA 's Operational Land Imager-2 on the Landsat 9 satellite demonstrate. The algal bloom as seen from space.

Cyanobacteria covering over half of the surface of Florida’s largest freshwater lake on June 12. NASA Earth Observatory image by Wanmei Liang, using Landsat data from the U.S. Geological Survey. The bloom had grown further to cover 420 square miles by July 4, and 440 square miles by July 1 5, covering nearly 60 percent of the lake's surface. Lake Okeechobee's bloom has been growing since May , when the Palm Beach County Health Department issued health warnings after toxins from the algae were detected in the its water. The agency urged people to avoid swimming in or drinking from the lake. It has had past issues with harmful algal blooms, with 45 percent of the lake being covered by the algae in July last year, and up to 90 percent of the its surface being coated in 2018, triggering a state of emergency across seven Florida counties. Algal blooms are excessive growths of micro-organisms called cyanobacteria, which grow and reproduce rapidly when water is warm and abundant in the chemicals they need, like phosphorus and nitrogen. The algae can grow in large, odorous mats, and produce toxins, including those that target the liver (hepatotoxins) or toxins that target the nervous system (neurotoxins) . One of these toxins is microcystin, which was found in water samples taken from the lake on June 17. This toxin was found in 39 percent of lake s sampled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2017. These can be harmful to people that consume the water, causing flu-like nausea , vomiting and diarrhea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as throat or eye irritation, allergic reactions and respiratory issues.

ISTOCK / GETTY IMAGES PLUS Algal toxins can also harm, or even kill, pets and other animals. ""Owners can protect their pets by keeping their dogs away from bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds and rivers that you suspect may contain blue-green algae—this includes not letting them swim in or drink from the water, but also well away from the banks and surrounding areas,"" a spokesperson for the Kennel Club—a U.K.-based charity devoted to dog health and welfare— previously told Newsweek . ""Pay attention to any signage that may indicate if there is any nearby, but bear in mind that this may not be in place. ""If you suspect your dog has come into contact with blue-green algae, take them to your vet urgently—if possible, call ahead to let them know you are on your way as cases of blue-green algae poisoning often need rapid treatment."" Animals may also suffer neurological damage as a result of algal toxins, which can cause behavioral changes and uncharacteristic aggression, as has been suspected to have happened in cape fur seals in South Africa .

They also deplete oxygen in bottom waters which can cause fish and invertebrates to die off in large numbers, leading to serious consequences for coastal communities. Quantifying global algal blooms Article by Adam Thomas Photo by Stephanie Dohner July 03, 2023 UD’s Yun Li part of research group using satellite imagery to quantify and characterize global harmful algal blooms Phytoplankton blooms — accumulations of microscopic algae in the surface of fresh and marine bodies of water — have complex and sometimes contradictory responses to the environments they are exposed to in coastal oceans. On the one hand, they can be beneficial to coastal fisheries because they fix carbon at the base of the food chain, which helps support fisheries and ecosystems across the globe. On the other hand, when algae spread too rapidly, it can lead to harmful algal blooms (HABs). These HABs produce toxins that accumulate in the food web, causing closures of fisheries and illness or mortality to marine species and humans. They also deplete oxygen in bottom waters which can cause fish and invertebrates to die in large numbers, leading to serious consequences for coastal communities. As a result of climate change, these overall algal blooms around the globe are estimated to become more frequent and more widely distributed. To help quantify and provide a detailed characterization of bloom occurrence and distribution across the globe, an international group of researchers — including University of Delaware assistant professor Yun Li — recently used satellite observations to map daily coastal algal blooms between 2003-2020. The results were published in March 2023 in Nature. Lian Feng, associate professor at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China, was the corresponding author on the paper. Expanding and intensifying blooms The researchers found that algal blooms occurred in 126 out of the 153 coastal countries examined and that on a global scale, both the frequency and spatial extent of the blooms increased significantly over the study period of 2003-2020. However, they also found that the blooms weakened in tropical and subtropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere which is where Li helped to bring her expertise to the project. Li, assistant professor in the School of Marine Science and Policy , said that while most areas of the globe have bloom-favorable seasons when the surface temperature of the water rises, it is not always the case with the tropical and subtropical areas. The researchers found that the sea surface temperature-based mechanism they used for other areas to measure bloom frequency does not fully apply to the tropical and subtropical regions. “The other researchers talked with me after the initial analysis was done for the quantification because they found that there are some regions that show a decrease in temperature but an increase in the algal blooms which is counterintuitive,” said Li. “They had different dynamics that were under consideration but they were still missing certain dynamics to explain the blooms in the western boundary current regions.” In a 2022 paper published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans  on which she was a co-author, Li and the corresponding author Xinfeng Liang, associate professor in UD’s School of Marine Science and Policy, wrote that western boundary currents — especially those in the tropical and subtropical regions — are able to lift water mass vertically in the water column, resulting in upwelling that contributes significantly to the vertical transport of ocean properties and materials such as heat and nutrients. When the researchers for this paper applied the upwelling data that Li had analyzed, they found a high consistency with their satellite imagery and realized that it provided a regional explanation for why the algal blooms were weakened in certain tropical and subtropical areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The research team used their own algorithm to detect the level of phytoplankton blooms in coastal oceans. Li said this can be a challenge because there is a lot of contamination of satellite signals when it comes to the coastal regions so even before they had any results, creating this high-resolution algorithm was incredibly impressive. “Their algorithm detects blooms within one-kilometer resolution which is really high,” said Li. “For reference, the widely-used product is about 4-kilometer resolution, so they are really pushing the limit with one-kilometer resolution.” Phytoplankton bloom implications Li said the paper can be used as a tool for policy makers to evaluate decisions according to new information as it provides a map showing where blooms are occurring, when they will occur and how they are evolving with climate change. “This is the base of the food web so we think that this can be used as input data for most food web models or fishery management information,” said Li, who noted that some areas in the United States already have applications of when the fishing season opens or closes with the consideration of potential changes in phytoplankton blooms. By using this data, an area like the high latitudinal regions would be able to know that they might need to have their fishing season occur earlier in the year, as the warmer weather would lead to an earlier bloom. In addition, the information can be used to know when to close up conservation areas in order to protect the ecology in those areas. “This will provide guidance for the policymakers or stakeholders to guide the market price and for other human activity to be able to handle those earlier harvests,” said Li.

Jennings Posted: Aug 21, 2023 / 10:08 AM MDT Updated: Sep 14, 2023 / 07:19 PM MDT SHARE SALT LAKE CITY ( ABC4 ) — This summer has seen a rise in harmful algal blooms at local Utah reservoirs, lakes, and rivers. The Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality is warning the public about their presence and the possible health hazards. What is a harmful algal bloom? “Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae or harmful algae, aren’t actually algae. Rather, they are aquatic bacteria that photosynthesize like a plant,” DEQ states. Cyanobacteria reportedly naturally live in every water body in the world. A harmful algal bloom happens when these bacteria multiply quickly to form a “bloom,” or visible colonies of millions of cells, according to DEQ. Don’t swim in Scofield Reservoir, officials say Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality Courtesy of Utah Dept. of Environmental Quality “Sometimes the cyanobacteria that form these blooms can produce toxins which cause illness and can damage the human kidney, liver, or neurologic system. Pets and livestock are more likely to drink water and be hurt by these toxins,” DEQ states. In some areas, DEQ has issued a “Warning Advisory” which means people and pets should not swim in the water and use caution when fishing or eating fish from the area. Watercraft, such as boats and canoes, are still allowed in the area, however, Utah officials say to avoid sections with visible algae blooms. A “Health Watch” is less severe and advises caution when swimming or fishing. Many Health Watches can turn into Warning Advisories at a later time. Here is a list of Utah water bodies that are currently affected by dangerous waterborne pathogens: Box Elder County Mantua Reservoir — Warning Advisory. A harmful algal bloom is present. The Pond at Willard Bay — Warning Advisory. The Pond is closed due to harmful algae. Carbon County Scofield Reservoir — Warning Advisory. Harmful algae is present.

So here’s a map worth checking before you go out on the waters of San Francisco Bay. by Kate Golden August 7, 2023 Share This: For those who like to swim, fish, or boat in San Francisco Bay, but not when it is suffused with thick, soupy, potentially hazardous algae—the California Water Boards now has a map for that . Just in time, since algae season’s heating up. A recent glance at the map showed a rainbow spreading across the Bay, indicating a widespread bloom. In Berkeley and in Richardson Bay, near Sausalito, water sampling has confirmed it and determined the culprit is Heterosigma akashiwo —the same phytoplankton, dubbed the “flying potato” by researchers, that caused last summer’s first-ever Bay-wide harmful algal bloom, or HAB, leaving countless dead fish in its wake. In an Aug. 3 screenshot of the updated algae map , a 10-day average of chlorophyll-a shows Clear Lake looking rather unclear, and a wave of algae moving through the Bay. That algae appears to be the same species that caused the big bloom last August. The new map is really an improvement on an existing map that showed only freshwater and estuarine blooms. Those are best indicated by cyanobacteria, as detected by a satellite that sees its telltale blue-green colors. But most marine harmful algal blooms aren’t caused by cyanobacteria. They are usually caused by other species of phytoplankton. So the improved map includes data for chlorophyll-a, a molecule the phytoplankton produce that is a different color of green. (The data comes from the satellite Sentinel-3, via the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the map is a joint project of the Water Boards, NOAA, and the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s Aquatic Science Center.) This map is a screening tool built for the public—and also to give a heads up to California state water and public health agencies. “This tool is really good in helping know where we should be looking and targeting for sampling,” says Carly Nilson, an environmental scientist who manages the Water Boards’ freshwater and estuarine HABs program. Officials have not had such a heads up previously in part because—despite the enormous risk that these blooms pose to wildlife and potentially people—there is a Bay-size gap in jurisdiction. As the Water Boards reported this year to the Legislature, no agency is specifically responsible for responding to harmful algal bloom incidents in saltwater. No one agency is responsible for monitoring the Bay for the phytoplankton that causes such blooms. And no one agency is responsible for putting up warning signs. The Water Boards has recommended that the Legislature pass some legislation giving them, or another agency, such a mandate. The jurisdiction gap helps explain why last year’s Bay-wide harmful algal bloom caught officials off guard. For freshwater blooms, agencies know what their roles and responsibilities are in responding. “Everyone knows how it’s supposed to work,” Nilson says. “For responding to marine HABs, it’s a little less formal, a little more cushy. We’re still navigating what that looks like.” Ever since the big bloom last summer, a multi-agency workgroup has been meeting to share the responsibilities. As for the new map, officials are themselves still learning what it can tell them, according to Nilson. Just in recent days, the chlorophyll-a lit up Clear Lake (north of Santa Rosa, and known as a HAB troublemaker)—even before the cyanobacteria data “saw” it. Expect updates as they learn, and submit feedback to cyanoHAB.reports@waterboards.ca.gov. “It’s a work in progress,” Nilson says. Algal bloom, in its classic pea-soup form. (Photo by State of California ) Tips on using satellite data to avoid HABs Here’s a link to the HABs map . • Use the cyanobacteria data to look for freshwater HABs , and the chlorophyll-a data to look for marine HABs, like in the Bay. (The cyano data also only looks at the largest 250 lakes in California.) • Satellite data is a screening tool, not absolute truth. Truth comes from water sampling. There can be false positives (especially in freshwater, like when aquatic weeds are the same green as algae). • Timescales. You can look at either the past day for the most recent data, or a 10-day average for a more “holistic” view, Nilson says, though cloud cover can sometimes interfere with data. • How much algae is OK to swim in? That’s an open question, Nilson says. For saltwater, “the threat to human health isn’t as well understood as with some of these freshwater toxins.” But the general guidance is to try and avoid exposure to HABs of all kinds, marine or fresh, and to bathe thoroughly if you are exposed. You can learn more at the state’s Healthy Water Habits page . • Out in the real world, don’t rely on signage to tell you when the Bay isn’t safe for recreation, because no government agency is responsible for continuously monitoring throughout a bloom or notifying the public for saltwater HABs. So, learn how to recognize harmful algal blooms visually. (And know that at the tail end of a harmful algal bloom, when the algae are dying out, they generally release a bunch of toxins. Give it a few days to settle out before you jump in.) • Learn more: California’s Harmful Algal Blooms Portal is a central resources for all things HAB. You can review the current incident map along with the satellite data map. If you see a bloom, you can report it . And here’s a FAQ on harmful algal blooms . Update, Aug. 8, 2023: This story has been corrected to say that most (not all) harmful algal blooms are  not caused by cyanobacteria but some other kind of phytoplankton.

Search Home News News Releases Pyramid Lake Algal Bloom at Danger Advisory Print Page Pyramid Lake Algal Bloom at Danger Advisory Published: Jul 27, 2023 An aerial view of Pyramid Lake and Dam on May 12, 2023. SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Today, the Department of Water Resources (DWR) urged people to avoid physical contact with water at Pyramid Lake in Los Angeles County until further notice due to the presence of blue-green algae. Vaquero Swim Beach is closed, and Emigrant Landing Beach has a caution algal bloom advisory. People should also avoid eating fish or shellfish from the lake. Boating is allowed, but swimming and other water-contact recreation and sporting activities are not considered safe due to potential adverse health effects. Algal bloom treatment is planned for August 2 to help improve conditions possibly in a few weeks. For latest conditions and danger advisory information, go to Harmful Algal Bloom website . Advisories are based on the potential health risks from algae. Exposure to toxic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, can cause eye irritation, allergic skin rash, mouth ulcers, vomiting, diarrhea, and cold- and flu-like symptoms. Pets can be especially susceptible because they tend to drink while in the water and lick their fur afterwards. Keep pets away from the water. Bloom conditions can change rapidly, and wind and waves may move or concentrate the bloom into different regions of the reservoir. The algal bloom can accumulate into mats and scum, form foam at the surface and along the shoreline, and range in color from blue, green, white, or brown. State guidelines on cyanobacteria and harmful algal blooms recommend the following precautions be taken in waters impacted by blue-green algae: Take care that pets and livestock do not drink the water, swim through algal blooms, scum, or mats, or lick their fur after going in the water. Rinse pets in clean water to remove algae from fur. Avoid wading, swimming, or jet or water skiing in water containing algal blooms, scum, or mats. Do not drink, cook, or wash dishes with untreated surface water from these areas under any circumstances. Common water purification techniques such as camping filters, tablets, and boiling do not remove toxins. Do not eat mussels or other bivalves collected from these areas. No fish should be consumed under a danger advisory. Get medical treatment immediately if you think that you, a family member, friend, pet, or livestock might have been poisoned by blue-green algae toxins. Be sure to alert medical professionals to the possible contact with blue-green algae. Also, make sure to contact the local county public health department.

(Photo/iStock.) Share Source Alert Q&A: Toxic algae, warming waters imperil marine life on U.S. coasts In Southern California, toxic algae blooms are killing hundreds of dolphins and sea lions while record-high ocean temperatures threaten Floridas coral reefs. USC experts weigh in. August 02, 2023 Nina Raffio The images are heart-rending: hundreds of dolphins and sea lions washing up along the shores of Southern California, sick and dying from toxic algae poisoning . Photographed earlier this summer, they are the latest reminders that the climate crisis is becoming impossible to ignore. Toxic algae blooms, a recurring natural phenomenon, have long been observed in water off the coast of Southern California. But scientists are increasingly concerned over the frequency and severity of these deadly algal outbreaks. As climate change continues to warm ocean temperatures, these favorable conditions allow harmful algae to proliferate. USC News spoke with David Caron , an expert in biological oceanography who is closely examining the ecological crisis and its potential impact on local marine ecosystems, and Carly Kenkel , at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, who focuses on coral reefs. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin emitted by a type of algae called Pseudo-nitzschia australis , is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of marine animals from Santa Barbara to San Diego. How do toxic algae blooms affect other marine species like fish, shellfish and seabirds? Caron: Beyond marine mammals, sea birds that feed on small fish such as anchovies and sardines are at risk for significant intake of toxins if the planktivorous fish they prey on are consuming toxic algae. Most fish and shellfish appear to possess a reasonable tolerance for domoic acid (although some may be affected), but contaminated fish, particularly filter-feeding shellfish, pose a significant health risk to marine animals  and humans  that might consume them. But not all algal blooms are harmful. Many are beneficial and support aquatic food webs. When those blooms are dominated by algal species that are noxious or toxic, however, they can result in very harmful effects on biota. With rising ocean temperatures attributed to climate change, what changes have you observed in the timing and geographic distribution of toxic algae blooms? Caron: There is growing evidence for shifts in the latitudinal distributions of toxic algae along the U.S. West Coast that appear to be driven by changes in temperature (i.e., a warming ocean). However, overall, temperature plays a secondary role to nutrients in explaining the occurrence of algal blooms in general and toxic blooms in particular. The availability of essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus and some trace nutrients such as iron is key to understanding the location, frequency and severity of coastal algal blooms, and that extends to toxic blooms in freshwater ecosystems as well. Usually, when one talks about bloom-forming nutrients, the elements nitrogen and phosphorus are most discussed. Those two elements are needed in significant quantities for producing biomass, but generally, they are in the shortest supply for algae in many ecosystems. Thus, nitrogen and phosphorus tend to have a controlling influence on the magnitude of algal blooms. There are natural sources of nutrients, generally arising from the decomposition of dead organic material, but also man-made sources. Sewage, agricultural and domestic animal facilities, and urban runoffs tend to have very high concentrations of these elements. In waters where man-made sources are significant relative to natural sources, they can lead to or augment algal blooms. The Florida Keys reef tract, pictured here, has not experienced temperatures this extreme in at least 40 years. (Photo/iStock.) Why are coral reefs crucial for ecosystems worldwide? Kenkel: Corals are the foundation of tropical reef ecosystems. Reefs are incredibly biodiverse  like rainforests of the sea. They are home to 25% of all marine species. But they also play several other roles. They act as a natural breakwater and can prevent erosion and waves and are a major source of income from tourism and livelihoods around the world through subsistence fishing. Through your research, have you noticed any recent changes or patterns in coral reefs, or any other notable developments that can give us insights into the current state of these delicate ecosystems? Kenkel: Right now, the Caribbean is experiencing an unprecedented heat wave. Were seeing signs of major coral stress everywhere from Florida to Belize to the eastern tropical Pacific. The Florida Keys reef tract  the third largest barrier reef in the world  has not experienced temperatures this extreme in at least 40 years. The effects are particularly bad in the lower Florida Keys, where we do most of our research. Just this week, we had to mobilize to sample a long-term field transplant experiment early. The experiment was originally planned to run until next October, but the corals are unlikely to survive until then. Its fascinating how coral, an almost universally beloved symbol, resonates with people and inspires action. What is it about coral that makes it so effective in conveying the urgency of climate change? Kenkel: I think its really the reef ecosystems that inspire. While the coral itself is beautiful, my sense is that its the diverse array of fish and other animals that inhabit the reefs that truly bring the system to life. I think its all that diversity, together, that brings joy and inspires action . Climate change is a global problem, and were seeing these extreme heat events because of how much carbon dioxide is currently in our atmosphere. Every bit helps  taking public transit, buying locally, turning up your air conditioning just a few degrees, and, for those who can afford it, opting for clean-air or all-electric vehicles and installing solar panels and battery storage systems that will reduce your carbon footprint.

      To submit a letter to the editor for publication, write to letters@nytimes.com . It’s Toxic Slime Time on Florida’s Lake Okeechobee July 9, 2023 Share full article 263 Huge green blooms are threatening wildlife, pets, people and cities. And algae season is only getting started. Writer Dan Egan and photographer Josh Ritchie reported from Okeechobee’s shores, dodging the lake’s noxious fumes to understand the crisis and its costs. July 9, 2023 For thousands of years, Lake Okeechobee pumped life into Florida’s swampy interior. Summer rains swelled the shallow inland sea, creating seasonal overflows that sustained the Everglades and its alligators, panthers, spoonbills and snail kites. But a vast re-engineering over the past century has transformed Okeechobee into something life-threatening as much as life-giving. Toxic algal blooms now regularly infest much of its 730-square-mile surface during the summer, producing fumes and waterborne poisons potent enough to kill pets that splash in the contaminated waters, or send their owners to the doctor from inhaling the toxins. The Okeechobee mess, caused mainly by phosphorus-based agricultural fertilizers, festered out of the public consciousness for decades. But in recent summers the problem has become more dire. Climate change is making storms and rainfall more intense and less predictable, and last fall Hurricane Ian stirred up so much phosphorus that this summer is expected to be particularly bad. Things get further complicated when lake levels climb so high that contaminated water must be released into canals — toward coastal cities like Fort Myers and Stuart — to protect the structural integrity of the 143-mile-long dike holding back the lake. The coming weeks will offer a serious test. Lake Okeechobee 10 miles Lake Okeechobee 5 miles Lake Okeechobee 5 miles Algal bloom extent on June 12 Source: Satellite image by Landsat By Leanne Abraham Rainy season is just starting, but by late June the lake’s level was roughly two feet higher than the United States Army Corps of Engineers would like. While that’s a few feet below the dike’s potential danger zone, history has shown that Okeechobee can swell by that much in less than a month. Adding to the worry: More than half the lake is already suffering algal blooms. And the algae season has months to go. This has people downstream bracing for another summer of sludge. “We’re looking at a bullet in the chamber here,” said Eve Samples, executive director of the conservation group Friends of the Everglades. The state and the Army Corps of Engineers are trying to reduce the toxic flows to the coasts with a controversial re-engineering plan that has been decades in the making, including building a new lake from scratch to contain and decontaminate Okeechobee’s discharges. Star Robinson has watched the lake become perilous. Sunrise over Pahokee and Lake Okeechobee. Yet critics worry it’s still not enough, particularly as the world keeps warming. Scientists say hurricanes are getting not only more powerful because of climate change, but also wetter. Ian last year most likely dropped 10 percent more rain than would have been expected in a world without warming, researchers have said . Star Robinson, 55, grew up playing in and around Okeechobee. But in recent years her relationship with the lake has soured. On a morning jog in the city of Pahokee a few weeks ago, she kept at least 100 yards from the shoreline, and with good reason. Any closer and she risked choking on the lake’s lung-burning fumes. The only activity near the water’s edge? A cluster of buzzards. “They just love the smell of death and decay,” she said. The vapors come from rotting mats of a type of toxic algae — technically a cyanobacteria — that thrives in Okeechobee’s tea-warm water and feasts on rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide and the phosphorus-rich fertilizer and manure that wash off cropland and into the lake.

There are also concerns that long-term exposure could lead to organ damage and the risk of certain neurological disorders. “This has become almost like a permanent condition,” said Gil Smart, executive director of VoteWater, a nonpartisan group pushing for a more ambitious fix. “It’s like you have spring, you have summer, and you have algae bloom season,” he said. “Like clockwork.” Similar outbreaks have struck lakes elsewhere, including Lake Champlain, Lake Erie and Lake Tahoe. But Okeechobee is different. It is warm, flat and shallow as a backyard pool — making it more like a supersize petri dish than the wellspring of the Everglades. Ms. Robinson, the jogger, said she knows how to fix a lake that has “gone to hell.” “Stop the polluting,” she said. “That’s it. That’s the solution.” It’s not likely to happen anytime soon. Old dike, new hope The Herbert Hoover Dike, a grassy berm protecting lives and livelihoods. The crisis was borne of decisions starting a century ago to tame the lake by holding back its seasonal overflows in order to drain swamps, creating rich farmland. That has transformed southern Florida into one of the most important sugar-cane-producing regions in the world. It came at a heavy cost. Disaster struck in 1926, when a hurricane collapsed part of the dike, drowning hundreds of people. The dike was patched, but two years later it happened again, this time killing thousands. By the 1960s the Army Corps of Engineers proclaimed it had finally controlled the lake with what is now called the Herbert Hoover Dike, a mound of sand, rock and seashells rising a couple of stories above the table-flat landscape. Since the dike severed the lake’s natural flow into the Everglades, the corps now operates canals to carry much of the outflows eastward to the city of Stuart on the Atlantic coast, and west to Fort Myers on the Gulf Coast. For decades, the canals carried away lake water. Then, the algae came. The aftermath of the 1928 hurricane, which killed thousands of people. Roy Senff, Everett Collection Inc., via Alamy Rehabilitating the Herbert Hoover Dike in 1968. U.S.D.A.-A.R.S. Canal Point Sugarcane Field Station About a decade ago, Okeechobee’s outflows began triggering intense downstream algae outbreaks as green as anything Sherwin-Williams might concoct. The coastal impact was particularly bad in 2013, 2016 and 2018, causing beach closures, business shutdowns and even some residential evacuations. (This is different from red tide, another type of toxic algal bloom.) The releases were necessary because an old fear had returned. Engineers realized a few decades ago that Hoover Dike, notoriously leaky, was in danger of collapsing once again if water levels climbed too high. Today, tens of thousands of people live in Okeechobee’s flood path. An 18-year, $1.5 billion dike-fortification project was completed last January. That probably means fewer algae releases toward Fort Myers and Stuart. But nobody thinks Okeechobee’s problems are solved. Not only does climate change increase the risk of heavier rain in the future, but water can already flow into Okeechobee about six times faster than the canals can carry it away. That’s why high lake levels so early in the rainy season are worrisome. In the mid-2000s, for example, a particularly rainy period raised Okeechobee’s level by about four feet in just a month. The Army Corps of Engineers said it is doing its best to protect the ecological health of the peninsula, the people who live downstream and the farmers. “While I can’t promise that there won’t be high releases later this year due to the inherent uncertainty of Mother Nature, we will do our best to avoid them, if possible,” Col. James Booth of the corps said in June. A Manhattan-size project Re-engineering the lake created a sugar cane kingdom. This winter the corps moved ahead with a Manhattan-size reservoir and wetlands complex. A decade or so from now, a 37-foot-high wall — holding back the new lake — will tower over sugar cane country. The idea is that the reservoir will capture at least some of Okeechobee’s toxic outflows instead of sending them to the coasts. The 10,500-acre reservoir and the recently completed 6,500-acre artificial wetlands, designed to absorb phosphorus, are the centerpiece of a growing system of canals, gates, pumps and engineered wetlands built to clean the outflows so they can once again drift south into the Everglades as well as provide drinking water to booming South Florida. The two projects will cost roughly $4 billion. During a recent visit to the site, Tim Harper, an engineer with the South Florida Water Management District, parked his pickup and asked his passengers to take in the endless sea of sugar cane that will one day be lake bottom. “Now, imagine 23 feet of water above you,” he said, “essentially for as far as the eye can see.” It’s a difficult picture to conjure. Equally challenging to grasp is the idea that the whole new lake, as big as it sounds, will fill to capacity if only six inches of Lake Okeechobee is sent its way. An earlier proposal for a 60,000-acre system was scuttled when agricultural operators, primarily sugar cane growers, objected. Obtaining the land through eminent domain wasn’t an option after the Florida Legislature in 2017 prohibited allowing the state to force a sale. Fields of sugar cane dominate the landscape south of Lake Okeechobee. The lock and dam that feed the canal, which sometimes carries toxins toward Stuart. Scaling back the reservoir has required drastically increasing its depth. The corps says it will still be big and stout enough to trap and treat a significant amount of the contaminated waters. The project has the support of President Biden and Gov. Ron DeSantis, a 2024 Republican presidential hopeful. Many conservationists welcomed the decision to build a smaller reservoir as a major step in the right direction. “No project will play a bigger role in reducing algae-causing discharges from Lake Okeechobee,” said the chief executive of the Everglades Foundation, Eric Eikenberg. Others are skeptical. Bill Mitsch, retired director of the Everglades Wetland Research Park at Florida Gulf Coast University, sees the project as too small. He worries it may even result in harm to the Everglades if the phosphorus-absorbing wetlands don’t work as well as predicted. “There is just not enough capacity,” he said. Ms. Samples, of the Friends of the Everglades, shares that concern. “Florida has this century-long history of trying to out-engineer Mother Nature and having it backfire, and it really feels like we’re repeating the mistakes of our past,” she said. A new normal A late June bloom, lapping the shore. June 11 was a Sunday — a boat day — near Stuart on the coast. A flotilla of Floridians landed on a sandbank a couple of miles offshore and soaked up sun and drinks in thigh-deep waters. Some talked about how thrilled they were to see native seagrass making a comeback since it was ravaged five summers ago by Okeechobee toxic outflows. The grasses provide fish habitat as well as essential food for beloved manatees, which are in such a desperate condition that government crews have taken to feeding them romaine lettuce . Stefani Hughes, a real estate agent, remembered 2018’s outflows for the damage not just to the ecology, but to the economy as well. “I personally lost a $1 million sale watching the green plume come in,” she said. Conservationists say state rules to control the flow of phosphorus from agricultural lands, by far the largest source of the pollutant, have long been poorly enforced. Yet even if fertilizer runoff stopped tomorrow, the algae threat would persist for decades or more because there is already so much phosphorus tied up in cropland soils and lake sediment. This is one reason the path forward has included building the new reservoir and investing in phosphorus-catching artificial wetlands. But for the moment, people like Mr. Smart of VoteWater aren’t worried about the next decade. They’re worried about the next several weeks. “Everybody keeps their fingers crossed that we won’t have a rainy summer, and that the toxins that are in the lake, stay in the lake,” he said.

To address plastics and other problems that could affect human health, the NIH and the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) are jointly funding four new Centers for Oceans and Human Health and renewing two centers as part of a marine-related health research program . Each Center will focus on a different aspect of the interplay between environmental science, climate change, and human health in the ocean or Great Lakes. Together the two agencies plan to invest more than $42 million over five years for the centers program, continuing a two-decade long collaboration. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) administers the centers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and supports individual research projects that focus on the ocean and the Great Lakes and their impact on human health. Millions of tons of small pieces of plastic, referred to as microplastics are finding their way into the world’s oceans. These microplastics, ranging from the size of a width of a pencil to smaller than a sesame seed, often get eaten by fish and shellfish and are passed to humans through seafood consumption. They also act as microscopic sponges, attracting, concentrating, and carrying pollutants into new environments. These plastic particles and other factors, including a warming climate and more extreme weather events, are affecting the health of our waterways, and, in turn, the health of our citizens. “We know very little about what these microplastics or even smaller pieces of plastics, known as nanoplastics, can do to human health in the short-or long-term, or even what they can do to the health of the sea turtles and other animals that live in the ocean,” said Anika Dzierlenga, Ph.D., program lead at the NIEHS. Nanoplastics measure under one micrometer in length, the width of a spider web or virus, making it very easy for them to enter the human body through eating, breathing, and absorption through the skin. Once inside the body, they may leach harmful chemicals that may impact development, reproduction, and immune system responses. ""The connection among ocean pollution, climate change, and human health are problems that we are only beginning to understand,"" said Dzierlenga. “People rely on oceans and lakes for jobs, food, tourism, recreation. These centers will help bring researchers and community groups together to study and take action to protect public health in coastal regions and around the Great Lakes.” “We’re excited to continue this long-standing partnership with NIEHS. Bringing geoscientists, health scientists, and community partners together to address these important questions has far-ranging impacts beyond what either agency can support alone,” said Henrietta Edmonds, Ph.D., a program manager in NSF’s Division of Ocean Sciences. NIEHS-NSF Oceans and Human Health Center Awardees The centers foster interdisciplinary collaborations among biomedical researchers, physical and oceanographic scientists, and community partners. The following institutions, listed alphabetically along with the project name, lead researcher, and brief description of project, are newly funded. North Carolina State University, Raleigh North Carolina Center for Coastal Algae, People, and Environment (NC C-CAPE) Principal Investigator: Astrid Schnetzer This center, which was awarded at the end of February, will help lay the groundwork for how cyanobacterial (blue-green algae) blooms in estuaries or coastal waters impact seafood safety and public health. This research will help inform guidelines for the safe consumption of water and seafood. NC C-CAPE will also actively engage with community experts and stakeholders to guide the translation and application of research findings. University of California San Diego Scripps Center for Oceans and Human Health: Advancing the science of marine contaminants and seafood safety Principal Investigator: Bradley Moore The Scripps Center for Oceans and Human Health will evaluate the factors contributing to seafood safety concerns including impact from climate and weather, distribution of toxic chemicals across the aquatic food source chain, the role of the marine microbiome in toxin metabolism, and animal and human response to toxic chemicals. The grantees will consider both risks and benefits to seafood consumption and will help to develop messaging to seafood consumers. University of Rochester and Rochester Institute of Technology, New York Lake Ontario Center for Microplastics and Human Health in a Changing Environment Principal Investigators: Katrina Smith Korfmacher (University of Rochester) and Christy Tyler (Rochester Institute of Technology) This new center will be the first center within the Oceans and Human health Centers to focus solely on plastic pollution and microplastics. The Research organizations will collaborate to study the life cycle of plastic in Lake Ontario as it pertains to ecological and human health. The aim is to engage diverse local partners to prevent negative health effects of microplastics in the context of climate change in the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes are the largest surface freshwater system in the world and are a critical resource for more than 30 million people. Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts Woods Hole Center for Oceans and Human Health Principal Investigator: Dennis McGillicuddy Funding for this center has been renewed in 2024 and will build off its prior research to address how a changing climate could influence harmful algal bloom (HAB) dynamics and human exposure to HAB toxins, a serious and global human health threat. The center will also work to improve awareness of emerging HAB issues for the public health community and develop new educational materials and interactive activities for K-12 classrooms, and for health care providers. NIEHS and NSF expect to make two additional awards soon.

Credit: UGA Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant Mary Landers, The Current Green slime in Florida’s Lake Okeechobee and sickened sea lions on the California coast are two recent examples of harmful algal blooms making headlines. This overproduction of algae is not something that has popped up much on the Georgia coast, though. Researcher Mallory Mintz is a University of Georgia Skidaway Institute graduate student who is studying the ups and downs of algae growing in the Skidaway River in Savannah. She says there’s a good reason and a bad reason why a map of harmful algal blooms shows little in the 100-mile stretch from St. Marys to Tybee. First the bad: “Generally Georgia isn’t necessarily monitoring it like Florida is, like South Carolina is, so we’re not seeing these blooms,” Mintz told an audience gathered to hear her speak at the UGA Aquarium on Skidaway Island last week. And then the good: “So the Georgia Coast is a little bit special, right? We have those high tidal ranges. And that means that there’s high tidal flushing, so we’re getting a large influx of marine flood waters every day, (with) less nutrients.” While Georgia’s high tidal range makes algal blooms less likely, they have occurred here, she noted. One happened in the Skidaway River in 2019 and is believed to be the cause of a sudden death of a crop of baby oysters, called spat, raised at the oyster hatchery right next door to the aquarium where Mintz gave her talk. “They did a water change per usual, came back the next day, and it was 80% to 90% mortality of those little oysters,” she said. The working hypothesis is that a type of algae called Akashiwo were the culprits. Akashiwo — the term is Japanese for “red tide” — is a genus of algae that share the same garlic-clove shape. Some Akashiwo produce a toxin, though the particular ones in the Skidaway do not. “But they do produce that surfactant, that foam that I was talking about earlier, that can clump down bird feathers, and expose them to hypothermia. And it can literally clog the gills of oysters,” Mintz said. Mintz, who is currently taking twice daily low tide samples of river water, is on the lookout for a bloom. If one occurs, she’ll have data from before, during and after the event. She’s hoping to be able to understand what genes might be turned on during those particular scenarios that allow Akashiwo to scale up quickly. Hot weather generally encourages blooms, meaning more are expected with global warming. So does an influx of nutrients into a waterway, like fertilizer runoff from a farm or a sewage spill. Mintz’s work is piggybacking off about two decades of data recorded regularly by volunteers at about a half dozen stations along the Georgia coast, including a robust group at Skidaway. They’re part of the UGA Marine Extension and Georgia Sea Grant’s phytoplankton monitoring network, its longest-running citizen science program, now in its 20th year. Sandy Haeger is one of Skidaway’s citizen scientists; she also spoke at Mintz’s talk. Her neighbors recruited the fitness instructor and former elementary teacher to the National Phytoplankton Monitoring Network team more than a decade ago. She remembers how at her first phytoplankton training the equipment flummoxed her. “They took us into the phytoplankton lab, gave us a microscope, gave us a prepared slide and said ‘Go for it,’” Haeger said. “I had chemistry about 50 years prior. I’m embarrassed to say this, I didn’t know how to use the microscope.” She learned quickly. And though she found out there are “at least 80,000 types of these critters,” she learned to identify the most common ones in the Skidaway River. “Why would they think that I could do something like this? I have no idea. But I’m forever grateful to both of them. It’s been an amazing experience,” Haeger said. The knowledge gained from the volunteers led Mintz to her summer sampling schedule and could be key to warning the public, or the oyster hatchery next door, if another bloom is on the way. “If they’re having this bloom event, they won’t end up having the same sort of oyster die off,” she said.

Look out for blooming harmful algae! Once again, it is time to keep an eye out for harmful algae (cyanobacteria) blooms in Washington lakes and rivers. As the weather heats up, these blooms can happen, especially in late summer and fall. However, it’s impossible to guess how each lake or river will be affected due to changing climate conditions and human-caused excess nutrient pollution. Some lakes bloom regularly, some lakes rarely have blooms, and not every bloom is toxic. The only way to know for sure that toxins are present in an algae bloom is through laboratory testing. When in doubt, keep yourself and your pets safe by avoiding water with algae blooms and pay attention to warning and closure signs. What are harmful algae blooms? Algae are simple plants and bacteria that are a natural part of the ecosystem, but certain conditions can cause algae to multiply too quickly, resulting in an algae bloom. Algae blooms can happen in both fresh and saltwater. Blooms often indicate that the ecosystem is unbalanced and can create issues in the food web and reduce oxygen in the water. However, only some blooms have the potential to be toxic to humans, pets, and wildlife, which is why they are (appropriately) called harmful algae blooms. The Washington State Toxic Algae website has more information about harmful algae. See our information below about a common non-toxic algae bloom ( Noctiluca ) we often see in Puget Sound. Blooms can look different based on the species present. Most harmful algae blooms in lakes or rivers are caused by cyanobacteria. Blooms can be short-lived but can continue happening into the fall and their toxicity can vary from day to day. Laboratory testing is the only way to confirm if a bloom is toxic. However, there are a few common characteristics of harmful algae blooms to keep an eye out for: The appearance of slimy scum, foam, or growing clumps on the water Algae color can vary — blue-green, reddish-brown, pea soup green Looks like a paint spill on the water Cyanobacteria are often confused with green algae, because both can produce dense mats that can get in the way of swimming and fishing. However, unlike cyanobacteria, green algae do not generally produce toxins. Additionally, be aware of these possible signs that you or your pet may have been exposed to a harmful algae bloom: Skin rashes after being in the water Sudden, unexplained sickness after drinking or playing in the water See a bloom, give it room Because harmful algae blooms can only be accurately identified by lab tests, when you can, it’s best to avoid going into water with algae blooms. If you suspect you or your pet have been exposed to a harmful algae bloom, rinse off with clean water and seek appropriate medical attention. If you spot a bloom, contact the local lake manager. This could be the county public health department, city, or state park, depending on the lake or river. Because there is no statewide, comprehensive monitoring program, reporting blooms can be helpful. Check with your local municipality see if they have more information or monitoring data on a particular lake or river. Harder than predicting the weather There are multiple factors that combine to create a harmful algae bloom in freshwater lakes and rivers. Generally, excess nutrients (especially phosphorus) are one of the major components, and these nutrients often come from human sources (runoff). If the nutrient levels are high enough, then other factors like weather conditions and water flow changes can also trigger a bloom. Even though we know generally what issues cause blooms, how all of the factors come together to create a certain bloom on a particular lake are still not well understood, which is why they are hard to predict. A lake with normal levels of nutrients during springtime can still get an unexpected bloom during the summer due to nearby urban development and runoff. Similarly, a lake with high levels of nutrients can avoid a bloom if certain weather conditions are not met. There are too many elements involved in the production of a harmful algae bloom to accurately predict when and where they will occur. How algae blooms can be prevented While the precise triggers of harmful algae blooms are hard to pinpoint, there are still steps you can take to prevent water quality from worsening and reduce a lake’s chances of developing a bloom. Keep in mind, each lake and river has unique circumstances and needs, so not every prevention step can be applied everywhere. Clean up pet waste. Maintain your septic system to prevent leaks. Do not feed water fowl, like ducks and geese. Reduce or eliminate the use of fertilizers. Wash vehicles away from the lake or storm drains. Maintain native vegetation around the lake. Only time will tell if this will be a big year for algae blooms. If you want to learn more see our related links at the top of the page. A bloom of a different color Around Puget Sound, a fairly common sight in spring and summer months is bright red tomato-soup-like salt water, often along the shore. While it may look alarming, this isn't a harmful algae bloom, it is caused by a particular species of algae called Noctiluca . Noctiluca is a single-celled organism, in a group called dinoflagellates that live in marine water. While this bloom isn't toxic to people or pets, Noctiluca does contain ammonia which make them unappetizing for other species to eat. Also, studies have shown this ammonia can have a negative impact on juvenile fish swimming in the bloom. While Noctiluca are naturally occurring and blooms have been observed and recorded in Puget Sound since the 1940s, there is growing concern that human-caused excess nutrients are increasing the intensity, changing the timing, and increasing the spatial distribution of Noctiluca blooms. Eyes over Puget Sound takes to the air once a month to obtain high-resolution aerial photographs, record observations, and gather water quality data at 37 remote marine monitoring stations to track and record how weather and climate are shaping Puget Sound water quality.

63,https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/oregon-state-researchers-develop-novel-technique-sniffing-out-toxic-algae-blooms,Oregon State researchers develop novel technique for sniffing out toxic algae blooms - Oregon State University,"Skip to main content OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY Open search box Life at OSU » Newsroom Toggle menu Go to search page Search Field Exit Search For Journalists For Faculty and Staff Contacts News Archive 2023 Top 10 Stories For Journalists For Faculty and Staff Contacts News Archive 2023 Top 10 Stories Oregon State researchers develop novel technique for sniffing out toxic algae blooms August 17, 2023 CORVALLIS, Ore. – Researchers at Oregon State University have developed a new way to monitor the danger associated with algae blooms: “sniffing” the water for gases associated with toxins. The scientists found that certain combinations of volatile organic compounds released by algae can serve as indicator for microcystin , a toxin produced at varying levels during blooms of cyanobacteria , commonly known as blue-green algae. Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, said OSU’s Kimberly Halsey, who led the study. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Even though the research dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, said Halsey, associate professor of microbiology in the College of Science. She said the study published today in mSystems describes “a very creative new approach that’s better and less expensive than current monitoring methods and also has broader implications.” “This work suggests that VOCs might be used to indicate other important environmental shifts, like the onset of oxygen deficiencies in aquatic systems or domoic acid contamination in coastal ecosystems,” Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. VOCs are any of a number of carbon-containing chemicals with a high tendency to exist in their gaseous state. VOCs released by cyanobacteria seem to reveal the physiological status of the algae during toxic blooms, Halsey said. “One reason VOCs could be such great targets for monitoring is their volatility,” she said. “Ideally we’ll someday be able to sniff the air above the lake with instruments and see which gases are there during cyanobacterial blooms.” Cyanobacteria are microscopic organisms ubiquitous in all types of water around the globe. They use sunlight to make their own food and in warm, nutrient-rich environments can quickly multiply, resulting in blooms that spread across the water’s surface. These harmful algal blooms , often abbreviated to HABs, can form at any time of the year but most typically happen between spring and fall. An HAB in 2018 fouled drinking water in Oregon’s capital city of Salem, and in 2007 a national survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found microcystin, a recognized liver toxin and potential liver carcinogen, in one out of every three lakes that were sampled. Annual economic losses attributed to cyanobacterial HABs in the United States alone are conservatively valued at $2-4 billion, say the researchers, who add that the severity and consequences of the blooms are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. “That means we need new and innovative monitoring for cyanobacteria and their toxins,” Halsey said. “It’s super expensive to measure toxins directly, especially when a waterway needs to be sampled and tested weekly over the course of an entire summer.” Different cyanobacterial species produce different toxins, Halsey said. Most of them cause gastrointestinal illness and acute skin rashes, and they can be deadly. In 2017, more than 30 cattle died after drinking contaminated water at Junipers Reservoir near Lakeview, Oregon, and blooms particularly pose a threat to dogs entering affected lakes. Halsey, microbiology graduate student Lindsay Collart and associate professor of statistics Duo Jiang worked with two years of water samples from eight locations on and near Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon. The lake is important for agriculture and recreation, for tribal subsistence and culture, and for fish and wildlife, Halsey notes, but its water quality has declined over the last 50 years from intensive farming and drought. Upper Klamath Lake is one of many Oregon lakes affected by cyanobacterial HABs each year, but not all of the blooms result in toxic levels of microcystin, and the onset and levels of toxin production have been largely unpredictable. “The algae cells are always producing a little bit of microcystin, and it serves a good purpose in the cell – it helps combat stress,” Halsey said. “But the cells can reach a tipping point of over-reliance on microcystin and that’s when levels in the water become toxic.” Analyzing the dissolved gases in the water samples – 227 VOCs in all – the scientists were able to determine subsets of them that were associated with different levels of microcystin in the water. Statistical analysis of the VOC subsets does a better job predicting toxin levels than currently used techniques like assessing water color and measuring cell count, Halsey said. “Now that we know these particular subsets of compounds are predictors of toxicity, maybe we only need to measure those,” she said. Even though the study dealt with just one lake and one toxin, the research demonstrates VOCs’ potential in monitoring critical waterways, Halsey said. Further research, including collaborations with the city of Salem and Eugene Water and Electric Board, will explore whether the gaseous molecules can be used to predict the start and end of toxicity within a bloom event. Halsey said the study also showed that VOCs can be used to paint a general picture of community composition – i.e., the relative abundance of cyanobacteria to other microbes in the system – which she describes as potentially “another piece of the prediction puzzle.” The Oregon State College of Science and the OSU Agricultural Research Foundation supported this research. College of Science About the OSU College of Science: As one of the largest academic units at OSU, the College of Science has seven departments and 12 pre-professional programs.

Manasquan Reservoir is not under an ""alert""; it is under a ""watch"" and being monitored for bacterial levels. Two Monmouth County bodies of water are under advisories for potentially harmful levels of toxic bacteria, commonly referred to as blue-green algae. They’re among 69 lakes throughout New Jersey under watch or with restrictions on swimming, fishing and drinking because of the bacteria, according to the DEP Harmful Algal Bloom Response Program. None of those advisories are for waterways in Ocean County. An alert has been issued for Sunset Lake, where visitors should avoid fishing, drinking the water and swimming. The Manasquan Reservoir is under watch for possible contamination. Officials advise caution when swimming or boating on the reservoir, and eating fish and drinking water from the reservoir should be avoided. In the past five years, harmful algal blooms in New Jersey became about 40% more frequent, mostly affecting freshwater bodies. Hotter temperatures and increased pollution from human activity are the cause of the growing issue, said officials from the N.J. Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). What is a harmful algal bloom? These blooms are a growing global problem. While it is colloquially referred to as algae, the toxic organism is a bacteria, often cyanobacteria, with characteristics that resemble an aquatic plant. When the levels of phosphorus and nitrogen increase in water bodies, the bacteria feeds from it and grows, making the water more toxic. The bacteria will typically clear out on its own, but chemicals are used when levels are very high. Dogs and immune-compromised children tend to be more susceptible to cyanotoxin, which can provoke short-term health issues but rarely death, said Stan Hales, director of Barnegat Bay Partnership , an environmental organization. “The problem has become more frequent in the last few years. There's no doubt that (urban) development right off the water’s edge does contribute to the abundance of HAB (harmful algal bloom),” said Hales, who is also a fish and wildlife biologist. There is an ""emerging problem of cyanobacterial toxins being found in marine shellfish in estuaries, but it is unclear if this is a threat to human consumers,"" said Kate Silverstein, public affairs officer from the National Ocean Service. Changes in precipitation patterns and runoff from farms and land into waterways are two elements causing these toxic blooms to sprout more often, Hales said. While harmful algal blooms are commonly observed in freshwater, it can also happen in seawater. Nevertheless, it seldom happens at the Jersey Shore, he added. To learn if a body of water has been tested for harmful algal blooms, visit the N.J. DEP algal bloom sampling status website .

They look like spilled paint or grass clippings on the water's surface. (Photo: Montana DNRC) MISSOULA, Mont. — With warmer weather on the horizon, officials are asking people to be wary of harmful algal blooms. The Montana Department of Environmental Quality says the blooms can happen on reservoirs and lakes. They look like spilled paint or grass clippings on the water's surface. Experts say the blooms can create a toxin that is harmful to humans and animals. They urge people to not drink, swallow or swim in impacted waters. DEQ released the following information: As the weather starts warming, be on the lookout for harmful algal blooms (HABs) that can occur on Montana’s reservoirs and lakes. HABs appear as a coloration or scum on the surface of the water that can look like spilled paint or grass clippings. They can be blue, green, or gold. HABs can occur when there is a rapid overgrowth of blue-green algae (also called cyanobacteria).  The blue-green algae can produce toxins that can sicken humans and kill pets and livestock if ingested. If in doubt, stay out. Do not drink, swallow, or swim in water that shows signs of a HAB and keep kids, pets, and livestock out. To report suspected HABs or check the map of reported blooms, associated health advisories, and track reports, visit HAB.mt.gov.

Environmental advocates hope that a renewed push for awareness can help the public and those in power understand the severity of the issue. Assemblymember Anna Kelles and State Senator Lea Webb, along with a dozen or so other elected officials from local municipalities, cruised around the lakefront last week with Discover Cayuga Lake educators. Lawmakers learned about current threats to the lake and other environmental factors to monitor. The event was organized to bring officials together in hopes they then spread the message to their colleagues and inspire collaborative action among local governments. Section Sponsors The harmful algal blooms (HABs) were first recorded on Cayuga Lake in 2014 and typically occur between June and October. They have become more frequent since then, filling the water with a deceptive array of vivid blue and green colors caused by the algae. Algal blooms can occur for a multitude of reasons though they are typically attributed to excess phosphorus and nitrogen in the water that can come from run-off, warm temperatures, and slow-moving water. Cayuga Lake is primarily impacted by microcystin blooms, which can cause skin irritation and rashes and damage the liver if ingested. There were 88 HAB reports last year, according to the Department of Environmental Conservation. This year, as of Sept. 11, there have been 47 HABs reported and confirmed on Cayuga Lake , including 19 reported in the last two weeks. Throughout the summer, HABs forced the closure of local swimming holes on several occasions, particularly at Taughannock Falls. During the boat tour last week, seven more HABs were reported, though not confirmed. “There’s been a lot of blooms this year,” said Stephanie Redmond, a steering committee member for Cayuga Lake Environmental Advocates Network (CLEAN) who also attended the event. “Especially now, over the last week when it’s been really warm out. […] With high temperatures, run-off, other stuff, it’s getting worse, unfortunately.” Redmond has been testing Cayuga Lake temperatures using her own equipment and said temperatures are slightly higher this year. “One degree Celsius makes a huge difference in the ecology,” Redmond said. Redmond said the early September heat seen over the last two weeks could have caused the jump in HABs reports in Cayuga Lake. New York State Assembly member Anna Kelles speaks to the crowd, alongside Prof. Roxanne Razavi. The DEC runs several programs with the ultimate goal of preventing and mitigating HABs. Initiatives like the Water Quality Improvement Project help local governments (as well as non-profits and water conservation districts) undertake projects aimed at enhancing water health. In Enfield, where Redmond is Town Supervisor, town officials have already submitted a plan to New York State for approval under the Water Quality Improvement Plan, one example of what Redmond and other organizers hope will serve as a blueprint for attendees at last week’s gathering. “It’s an all-hands-on-deck moment,” Redmond said. “We need to bolster [the effort] any way we can, whether that is education, getting people engaged in protecting our water system. Events like that are helpful.” Matt Butler Matt Butler is the Editor in Chief of The Ithaca Voice. He can be reached by email at mbutler@ithacavoice.org.

(Courtesy Whitman County Public Health) Twitter Email Reddit SMS By Ellen Dennis ellend@spokesman.com (206) 486-5723 A frothy, green layer of muck recently coated a mileslong stretch of water on the Lower Snake River in southeast Washington, and scientists have warned people and their pets to stay away. The Whitman County Health Department issued an alert Oct. 6 that a blue-green algal bloom released toxins into the water between Wawawai Landing and Central Ferry State Park, making a roughly 30-mile stretch of the river temporarily hazardous for humans, pets and livestock. Satellite images show the west-flowing river changed color from blue to a deep green  over a short span of days. County workers posted signs along the contaminated stretch of river alerting the public to stay away from popular recreation spots for swimming, fishing and boating. The safety alert remained in effect as of Tuesday night. Algal blooms typically last days to weeks before dying off naturally and disappearing. The bloom on the Lower Snake appears to have started dying off, Whitman County Public Health Director Chris Skidmore said. But until the water tests safe for two consecutive weeks in a row, it is considered dangerous under state health guidelines. “When I saw it near Wawawai, it literally was the consistency of a very thick milkshake,” Skidmore said. “Really big buildup. It’s pretty gross.” The county health department has been monitoring the algal bloom since Oct. 2, when a water sample tested above the state health guidelines for microcystin. Microcystin is a liver toxin and can be harmful to touch and ingest for humans, pets and livestock. Fish and bird mortalities have also been reported in lakes and rivers with persistent cyanobacteria blooms. Algal blooms are becoming increasingly common in bodies of water. There are many types of blooms, and they’re not always toxic. Sunny days combined with high nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels in the water are the recipe for a bloom. An algal bloom showed up on the Lower Snake last year, but the county health district did not put up warning signs or send out an alert because the bloom reportedly did not emit toxins. Maddy Lucas is a chemist who collects water samples for the county health department once a week. The most recent test samples – collected Friday – indicated the Wawawai and Central Ferry locations still contained harmful toxins. Algal blooms are becoming more frequent across the state, Lucas said. Scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have reportedly been doing algal bloom research on the Columbia River this year. The algal bloom on the Lower Snake is the most extreme bloom Lucas has seen in that body of water. “This is a pretty sizable bloom to see on a river,” Lucas said. “And it is thick. At some points, it stretched across the entire river, shore to shore.” The state water safety threshold is  eight parts per million for blue-green algae. If a health department collects a sample that tests above this value, it issues a warning for the body of water. Water collected Friday from Wawawai Landing tested 17 times more potent than the state’s safety threshold for cyanobacteria at 139 parts per million. Regular testing is crucial, Lucas said, because it’s impossible to tell if an algal bloom is toxic just by looking at it. It’s hard for scientists to predict  when a bloom will happen, said Colleen Keltz, a spokesperson for the Washington Department of Ecology. But years where there are warm, dry springs can be a setup for algal blooms. Blooms are more common in stagnant bodies of water, such as lakes. In rivers, blooms happen more near dams or natural blockades that disrupt the current. Alex Fremier, an environmental science professor at Washington State University, said the bloom on the Lower Snake is “unusually large” for a river. “The Snake River at that section has a bunch of dams on it,” Fremier said. “At this time of year, it functions more as a reservoir than a river.” Algal blooms can harm water ecosystems when they die, because decomposing blooms absorb oxygen from the water. Low dissolved oxygen levels in water can kill fish and other river-dwelling animals and plants. Whether a bloom will harm wildlife depends on a lot of factors. Cooling temperatures and rain brought by fall will decrease chances that the Lower Snake bloom will damage the ecosystem there, Fremier said. Conditions for algal blooms are primed by certain human land use practices, as well as climate change. Fremier said nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers that run off into rivers and dams that block the current are big contributors. Globally, algal blooms are increasing in a warming climate, he said. Warming temperatures and dryer conditions are a recipe for algal blooms, he said, and seeing blooms in rivers more often could be part of the “new normal” in a warming climate. “Blooms are going to happen, and they’re going to happen with increased frequency,” Fremier said. “That’s the bigger concern. We have to have the systems in place to protect ourselves and protect the public.” Dammed waters and blooms are “certainly” connected, Fremier said. Until the health department determines the water is safe again, people are urged to take the following precautions near the Snake River between Wawawai Landing and Central Ferry State Park: •Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski, fish or boat in the water. •Wash skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with the river’s water. •Keep pets away from the area. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water while the safety warning is in place. •Do not cook or clean dishes with water in the river. Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins.

The bill will provide the state with a critical clearing house of data and strategic information related to harmful algal blooms (HABs), ensuring the health of residents and waters of New York . While HABS were once rare in the state, they have recently appeared in reservoirs, lakes, ponds, and coastal areas. In 2022, the DEC reported 1,053 HABS in 204 water bodies across the state, which likely understates the problem due to underreporting. HABs impede bodies of water for many purposes like recreation and industry, but most importantly, as sources of drinking water. New York has been one of the more proactive states in monitoring HABs on specific water bodies, but concerns remain that a comprehensive and coordinated State strategy is needed to monitor, identify causes, and take steps to more effectively prevent and mitigate HABs. For the first time in New York, the HABMAP Act will create a centralized resource for reporting and dealing with HABS, including potential and known causes, best practice interventions, expertise, and funding resources. The data and subsequent report will enable the state to effectively and efficiently administer a grant program supporting data-driven best practices in preventing and mitigating harmful algal blooms. “Our state's freshwater resources are the envy of the world, but they are increasingly vulnerable to pollution and the effects of a warming climate. Every season, toxic algal blooms plague many New York lakes, causing a potentially dangerous situation for residents who depend on lakes for drinking water or use them for recreation,” said Senator Rachel May (D-Onondaga, Cayuga). “The HABMAP Act will help state and local governments understand, identify, and manage threats to our water while maintaining the high quality of life that residents, employers, recreational boaters, fishing enthusiasts, and tourists from around the world have come to expect.” Assemblymember Anna Kelles stated “Last summer, we saw the alarming rate at which Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) were affecting recreation, wildlife, and drinking water in Cayuga Lake and across the Finger Lakes Region and the State. This bill provides a clear mechanism to understand the causes of HAB’s and start improving our water quality, enhancing recreation, wildlife habitat, and limiting harmful algal blooms. If enacted, New York will be at the forefront of producing data that can be used to offer new insights for agencies, local governments, residents, and more, to reduce polluting runoff into our lakes.” related legislation 2023-S8356 Introduced In Committee Assembly In Committee Senate On Floor Calendar Assembly On Floor Calendar Senate Passed Assembly Passed Senate Delivered to Governor Signed By Governor Enacts the ""harmful algal bloom monitoring and prevention act"" January 22, 2024 In Senate Committee Finance Sponsored by Rachel May Do you support this bill? subscribe Aye Nay Print as PDF Share this Article or Press Release facebook twitter email Newsroom Go to Newsroom Press Release Child Poverty , Poverty , accessible housing , Access to Education , Employment Report by Cities 2 Chair Senator Rachel May sheds light on poverty in New York’s Upstate cities April 12, 2024 Video Senator May celebrates SU Women’s Basketball Coach Felisha Legette-Jack’s achievements with Senate Resolution April 3, 2024 Press Release Middle Class Tax Cut Senator Rachel May and Senate Democrats Announce Lowest Personal Income Tax Rate in over 70 Years For Middle-Income Earners April 3, 2024 Press Release Energy Costs Senator Rachel May and The Senate Majority Passes Legislation Protecting Ratepayers Includes NY HEAT Act to Meet CLCPA Standards March 28, 2024 Pagination Current page 1 Page 2 Page 3 Page 4 Page 5 Page 6 Page 7 Page 8 Page 9 Next page Ways We Can Make Every Day Earth Day Read More 2023 Women of Distinction Honoree Read More 2023 New York State Senate Veterans' Hall of Fame Honoree Read More Tick & Lyme Disease Prevention Read More NYSenate.gov News & Issues Senators & Committees Bills & Laws Budget Events About the Senate Follow the New York Senate Socials Policies Accessibility Statement Contact the Senate Creative Commons Developers Home Rule Form Policies & Waivers Privacy Policy Terms of Participation",06 Feb 2024 08:00:00

Lincoln Beach and Provo Bay at Utah Lake are under health advisories due to the outbreak of harmful algal blooms, or cyanobacteria, which can cause respiratory problems, skin irritation and in some cases be fatal for dogs. With the summer heat and with stagnant air patterns, the conditions create a cocktail for public health risks. The Utah Department of Environmental Quality is advising residents to avoid contact with the water at those two locations. The presence of the dangerous toxins also serves as a reminder to avoid boating, to thoroughly clean fish and to keep animals away. A health watch is also in effect for McClellan Lake, which is part of the family of Payson Lakes. Hannah Bonner, recreational health advisory program coordinator with the Utah Division of Water Quality, said Utah Lake is the typical hot spot for algal bloom outbreaks, but there are troublesome areas elsewhere in the state. Related Utah’s drought and low reservoirs add up to more intense algal blooms Unprecedented algal blooms offer lessons for the future Mantua Reservoir above Brigham City is under a health watch and the 11-acre Willard Pond is closed as a precaution due to algal blooms. The pond is a distinct water body from Willard Bay, which has had no impacts due to algae this season. Water quality regulators do routine sampling throughout the state of recreational waterways for algal blooms and for waterborne pathogens like bacteria, viruses and parasites that can make people sick. E. coli is the chief indicator of the presence of pathogens and is the result of fecal contamination.

Coli contamination a hidden danger in the Virgin River Harmful algal blooms result from the process of photosynthesis. “The bacteria need lots of sunlight and it is very affected by the warm temperatures, so when we have these hot or warm sunny summers, that facilitates this harmful algal growth,”  Bonner said. “The other component of the equation is the algae also needs nutrients to feed and reproduce and that is actually caused by nutrient pollution, which is a more directly caused human input.” Those nutrients — phosphorus and nitrogen — come from wastewater discharge, urban runoff, agriculture and other sources. It’s a tough problem, she conceded. “I mean, it’s hard. We can’t stop the summer from being hot because we don’t have direct control over that. But we can actually do substantial things to affect nutrient loading.” The state implemented a technology-based limit for phosphorus, Bonner said, and in the last five to 10 years, there’s been significant strides made in the arena of water quality improvement. “I think even Utah Lake is a good example of this. There have been a lot of of big, big reductions in point source nutrient inputs, a lot of restoration projects to reduce runoff,” she said. “But it is going to take a lot of individual and community buy-in to stop that nutrient input and still be able to control or at least reduce the recurrence of these harmful algal blooms.” The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said harmful algal blooms are a major environmental problem in all 50 states. The federal agency said states have reported about 15,000 water bodies with nutrient problems, including the Mississippi River Basin that spans 21 states and drains into the Gulf of Mexico. There, the blooms have created a dead zone that cannot support aquatic life. It added that reported drinking water problems due to nitrates have nearly doubled in the last decade. 1 of 3 Ellen Bailey, environmental scientist with the Utah Division of Water Quality, categorizes water samples collected from Utah Lake on Thursday, July 13, 2023.

In the fight to improve tracking and potentially slow down algal impacts, Mulholland and ODU Eminent Scholar and Professor Eileen Hofmann were recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA). The grant supports a five-year project to conduct real-time surveillance and data of harmful algal blooms in the Chesapeake Bay and other major waterways in the Hampton Roads region. The data will be used to build forecasting products for harmful algal blooms in the mid-Atlantic region. This multimillion-dollar research project was funded by the NOAA Monitoring and Event Response for Harmful Algal Blooms (MERHAB) program and begins Oct. 3, 2023. ODU is the lead institution and Mulholland is the principal investigator. She will work with scientists from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), the NOAA National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) to conduct research through 2028. A plethora of agency and community partners will work cohesively with Mulholland to detect, monitor and provide better surveillance on threatened waterways. The partners will use both existing microscopic imaging technologies such as the Imaging FlowCytobot and Flowcam, and emerging technologies such as Planktoscopes to remotely detect harmful algae. PlanktoScope phytoplankton imaging systems will be used in the field and in partner laboratories to enhance data collection and to build image libraries and classifiers using machine learning. Once built, these libraries and classifiers will be used for early and rapid detection of potentially harmful algae in the field and allow a wide array of stakeholders to participate in the detection and monitoring of harmful algal blooms so that managers can take steps to mitigate their impacts on mid-Atlantic coastal resources. The use of PlanktoScopes will provide improved real time detection and near real-time data products to improve forecasting and advise stakeholders where and when populations of M. polykrikoides and A. monilatum, two prominent bloom-forming algae in the Chesapeake Bay , are likely to impact water quality, aquatic habitats and commercial fisheries operations. These blooms, which Mullholland has been researching for more than 20 years, cause disruptions to wild and farmed seafood production, coastal tourism and recreation and healthy coastal ecosystems. “This project will significantly augment monitoring and management through coordinated laboratory, field, satellite and modeling studies that will build on our ongoing and previous projects and activities, leverage and expand our existing monitoring/modeling frameworks, incorporate emerging technologies and engage stakeholders in co-development and co-production of approaches,” Mulholland said. She also said it will result in a massive increase in data collection of harmful algae in the region. Currently, “states don’t have the resources to survey their coastal waters, and satellites only ‘see’ the water’s surface and can’t distinguish harmful from non-harmful algae,” Mulholland said. With the use of image-classifying software and machine learning, Mulholland and her team of expert scientists and partners will be able to identify algae bloom in near real-time. “Our current models are limited by the lack of consistent long-term measurements that can identify important local controls on harmful algal blooms,” Hofmann said. “The measurements from the expanded observational network developed in this project will provide new insights that will allow us to refine our current models and greatly advance our capability to forecast the occurrence of harmful algal blooms in the Chesapeake Bay.” Using newly developed technology and enhanced monitoring and surveillance, the early detection of these harmful algal blooms will allow managers and stakeholders to be proactive about mitigation of their negative effects. Citizen scientists will also be trained to observe and report discolored or bioluminescent water and collect water samples. Observations and forecasts will be publicly available through the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Forecasting System and the MARACOOS OceansMap portals, allowing stakeholder groups to avoid bloom-waters and prevent aquaculture losses. According to the 2018 Census of Aquaculture (USDA), Virginia is the largest seafood producer on the east coast of the U.S. and ranks first in the nation for hard clam and eastern oyster production. “I am excited to see the advances fostered by this new NOAA NCCOS research project, including enhanced monitoring to help minimize harmful algal bloom-related disruptions to Virginia oyster growers and a pilot observing network and forecasting system to help mitigate harmful algal bloom impacts across the Chesapeake Bay Region,” said Marc Suddleson, MERHAB program manager at NOAA National Ocean Service. Some of the largest stakeholders of this project are citizens living, working and recreating in mid-Atlantic coastal waters and the Chesapeake Bay. Citizen outreach and engagement will be a crucial component of this project. Climate change has resulted in increased tidal flooding and higher water temperatures in the lower bay and these changes are thought to be conducive to larger and longer blooms of potentially harmful algae. “It has taken 20 years to assemble a robust regional network of experts who have the capacity to implement this project,” Mulholland said. ""Our team of five investigators at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) is excited about this collaboration that will leverage our existing collection efforts in the York River and expand our engagement with local stakeholders,” said Pierre St-Laurent, a senior research scientist at VIMS. He is also excited at the prospect of supplementing the real-time data with the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Forecast System (CBEFS, www.vims.edu/cbefs ). This public online resource already provides bay-wide forecasts to local fishermen, and Laurent said extending its predictions will turn it into a critical asset for the whole Chesapeake Bay community.

Harmful algae blooms are often caused by a rapid growth of cyanobacteria, known as blue-green algae, a naturally occurring bacteria. Gary Kohlhepp, Lake Michigan unit supervisor of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said that a small amount of cyanobacteria is a safe and natural part of the water system, but it can become toxic when it begins to cluster in large quantities and creates blooms. Toxins produced in these blooms can lead to illness in humans and animals. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, blue-green algae blooms are a common occurrence in the Great Lakes, specifically Lake Erie. CDC report results The CDC report collected voluntary data from public health agencies across 16 states on harmful algae bloom events in 2021, referred to as harmful algal blooms in the report. Here were the findings: Most reported events occurred during the summer, with a peak in August (25% of reported events). Most of the events (90%) reported were in lakes, reservoirs or other freshwater bodies. A third of the reports of human illness occurred in June. The most common symptoms in humans were gastrointestinal, generalized (headaches and fevers, for example), and dermatologic. Reports of animal illnesses occurred primarily in August (86%), mostly involving wildlife. The most common symptoms in domestic pets were gastrointestinal, such as vomiting, and generalized, such as lethargy. A harmful algae bloom event in Washington killed 2,000 bats. There were 368 harmful algae bloom events reported, resulting in 117 human cases of illness and at least 2,715 animal cases of illness. (Animal cases are underrepresented because some group animal reports did not provide the number of total animals impacted, or indicated that the number they gave was an underestimate.) Kohlhepp said that EGLE had seen an increase in reporting on harmful algae blooms, though that may not indicate an actual increase in the quantity of blooms in the state. “I think some of that increase is just that people are more aware of it and more likely to report it,” he said. Pets: Dogs are dying from blue green algae. What owners need to know Spotting harmful algae blooms These harmful algae blooms can appear as accumulations of algae that coat the surface of the water or as a neon green color in the water. Kohlhepp said that if there aren’t any visible signs of a harmful algae bloom in the water, there’s a good chance it’s safe, though the only certain way to tell whether a body of water is toxic is by testing. In one instance, Kohlhepp’s team tested a clear spot in a lake that had a harmful algae bloom in another part of it. In the spot that appeared clear, there was only a miniscule amount of cyanobacteria picked up. “The good news is, generally, if you don’t see a bloom, the toxins are not present,” Kohlhepp said. “There’s almost always an indication that there’s something going on when the toxins are present, either that bright color or the surface accumulation.” Great Lakes: Antibiotics for humans, livestock found in waters flowing to Lake Erie Symptoms of exposure According to Michigan Sea Grant , the most common type of blue-green algae in the Great Lakes is microcystis, a bacteria which produces a liver toxin and skin irritant. When exposed to these harmful algae blooms, humans often develop a rash. Other possible symptoms include nausea, headache and fever. Animals, such as dogs, who experience symptoms may appear sluggish. Other symptoms found in animals include vomiting and dark urine. Steps to take after exposure Because humans usually experience dermatologic symptoms, Kohlhepp recommends washing off as soon as possible after coming in contact with a harmful algae bloom. If they notice symptoms, they should visit a doctor for next steps. Dogs and other animals should also be rinsed off after exposure, though symptoms may still arise if they ingested the algae-filled water. Pet owners should watch for symptoms and take them to a veterinarian if they notice any symptoms. How to report a harmful algae bloom EGLE collects reports of harmful algae blooms through email at algaebloom@michigan.gov . They recommend sending a photo alongside the report, so that they can more easily identify algae blooms and send someone to test the water.

Here's how to spot them and stay safe - The Arizona Republic,"Local Sports Things To Do Politics Travel Advertise Obituaries eNewspaper Legals ARIZONA Harmful algae are blooming in Arizona lakes. Here's how to spot them and stay safe Laura Daniella Sepulveda Arizona Republic Harmful algae were reported this month at Tonto National Forest, and park rangers are advising people visiting lakes to avoid contact with the water, as it could be poisonous. Here's what you need to know and how to stay safe. What are harmful algae? According to the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality, algae are a normal part of aquatic ecosystems and can be found in all types of water. But when these microscopic organisms grow out of control, which is called a ""bloom,"" they can release a toxic substance that can cause serious illnesses and can even be deadly in rare cases. The two most common algal blooms in Arizona are blue-green and golden algae. Blue-green algal blooms produce toxins or poisons that can make people and pets sick upon contact with the water, and they can be particularly dangerous for children, according to the Tonto National Forest. A bloom of golden algae can kill fish populations, according to ADEQ, but experts don't know with certainty if it is harmful to humans or other animals. However, the department advised people to not ingest the water or eat fish that were in water impacted by a golden algae bloom. Where are algae blooms in Arizona? This summer, blue-green algal blooms have been spotted at Tonto National Forest and Bartlett Reservoir Lake in Cave Creek, but you can easily identify if the water has an algal bloom by the way it looks. According to the ADEQ, water with harmful blue-green algae can have the following appearance: Look like pea soup or spilled green paint Discolor or leave streaks in the water Be surface scum, mats or films Appear as green dots or globs floating below the surface 41 years later, officials identify body found near Kingman Phoenix asks federal judge to amend 'Zone' restrictions Gov. Hobbs backs making this October holiday official Israel is at war with Hamas. What Arizonans need to know How do I stay safe? The department advised people to stay away from algae and scum in the water and to be particularly aware of keeping children and pets away from the shore, where algae can also accumulate. The national forest also advised people to never drink or use the water for cooking, and if you're unsure whether the water contains an algal bloom or not, stay out and do not touch the water. Boating and fishing are acceptable, according to the forest, but ingesting or being in contact with the water can be harmful. Harmful algae in Florida: Algae bloom prompts Army Corps to close beach along Florida's Caloosahatchee River The ADEQ asked the public to report possible harmful algal blooms. If you see one around Arizona, you can contact the local land owner or manager of the waterbody, file a report through the Arizona Water Watch mobile app or contact the department at truitt.rebecca@azdeq.gov . Fish kills and golden algae blooms can be reported to the Arizona Game and Fish Department.

This is in response to a water sample taken on March 4, 2024. The public should exercise caution in and around Dowling Lake-North . Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Wash your skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with algae or discolored or smelly. Keep pets away from the Waters where there are algae blooms are not safe for animals. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water when algae blooms are present. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish well. Do not eat shellfish in waters with algae. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals.

The public is advised to avoid contact with the water until algal concentrations return to acceptable levels, VDH said in a release. The reported blooms have produced blue/green discoloration and algal scums that should be avoided. Some harmful algae, called cyanobacteria, can cause skin rash and gastrointestinal illnesses, such as upset stomach, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The area to avoid can be seen on an interactive Harmful Algal Bloom map . A status report containing the advisory area may be viewed at Smith Mountain Lake – Blackwater River HAB Status Report June 6, 2023 . Sample results from collections on June 1 indicated a swimming advisory is necessary due to unsafe levels of cyanobacteria, which have the potential to produce multiple toxins. Toxin results at these sites are pending but will not change the advisory. People and pets are advised to avoid swimming, windsurfing and stand-up-paddle-boarding, as well as other activities that pose a risk of ingesting water in this area, VDH said. Activities such as boating may continue with proper precaution in the advisory area. Follow-up samples indicating algae and toxins are below levels of concern are necessary to lift the advisory — dates of next sampling are to be determined. The areas within the Blackwater River arm of Smith Mountain Lake where samples were collected: Blackwater River Unnamed Creek cove; Blackwater River at Kemp Ford Road Blackwater River cove at Virginia Key Trail Blackwater River cove near Anthony Ford Landing Algal blooms can occur when warm water and nutrients combine to make conditions favorable for algal growth. Most algal species are harmless. However, some species may produce irritating compounds or toxins. Avoid discolored water or scums that are green or bluish-green because they are more likely to contain toxins. To prevent illness, people should: Avoid contact with any area of the lake where scums are present or water is green or blue-green or an advisory sign is posted Not allow children or pets to drink from natural bodies of water. Keep children and pets out of the areas experiencing a harmful algal bloom and quickly wash them off with plenty of fresh, clean water after contact with algal scum or bloom water. Seek medical/veterinarian care if you or your animals experience symptoms after swimming in or near an algal bloom. Properly clean fish by removing skin and discarding all internal organs and cook fish to the proper temperature to ensure fish fillets are safe to eat. Contact the Harmful Algal Bloom Hotline at 1-888-238-6154 if you suspect you experienced health-related effects following exposure to a bloom. Visit www.SwimHealthyVA.com to learn more about harmful algal blooms or to report an algal bloom or fish kill. The Virginia Department of Health and the Virginia Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, which includes the VDH, the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and the Old Dominion University Phytoplankton Laboratory, will continue to monitor water quality in the lake. In general, advisories will be lifted following two consecutive test results (a minimum of 10-days apart) with acceptable levels for algal cell counts and/or toxin concentration. An advisory may be lifted or maintained at the discretion of the health department. For example, after one test an advisory may be lifted if results are within safe levels for swimming if other information indicates exposure or human health risk is low.

From the Poconos to the Jersey Shore to the mouth of the Delaware Bay, what do you want to know about climate change? What would you like us to cover? Get in touch . Camden County officials are warning the public about dangerous levels of toxic cyanobacteria in Timber Creek Pond in Gloucester Township. Also known as blue-green algae , cyanobacteria feed on nutrients in the water and thrive in warm water during summer months. Fertilizers in farm runoff often cause an increase in those nutrients, including nitrogen and phosphorus . WHYY thanks our sponsors — become a WHYY sponsor Officials are urging the public to stay away from Timber Creek Pond until they treat the toxic algae. “There is enough toxicity in the water that could, if an animal or human were to drink that water, it could cause liver damage, other internal organ damage,” said Mike Haberland, a county agent specializing in agriculture and natural resources with the Rutgers Cooperative Extension. “And with dogs, they can die within a few hours to a day.” Haberland says global warming may lead to increased occurrences of blue-green algae contamination in New Jersey ponds and lakes. “Average temperatures are increasing. And these critters like the warmer water,” Haberland said. Related Content Science N.J. climate report: Increasing temperatures could lead to more heat-related hospitalizations and deaths, especially in vulnerable communities Increasing temperatures could lead to more heat-related hospitalizations and deaths in the coming years, especially in vulnerable communities. 12 months ago To eliminate algal bloom, the county must treat Timber Creek Pond with a solution that kills nutrients cyanobacteria feed on. “We’ll spread the material on the pond. And hopefully, it will clean up in just a few days. But we’ll have to retest because we might be able to make the water look cleaner, but the toxins could still be in there,” Haberland said. In the meantime, Camden County health officer Paschal Nwako says officials have posted signs around Timber Creek Pond to “alert visitors” not to come in contact with the water. The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection monitors harmful algal blooms in lakes and ponds. According to an algal bloom tracker on NJDEP’s website , there are more than a dozen active blue algae contaminations in New Jersey, including at Alloway Lake in Salem County.

In her presentation, “Slow then Sudden Changes: Understanding the Conditions that Lead to Harmful Algal Blooms,” Dr. Hrycik will discuss the slow buildup of events that lead to algal blooms, including changes in water temperature, nutrients, water circulation and weather patterns. Identifying harmful blooms and differentiating them from other types of algae will also be addressed. Locations that Hrycik will identify in her talk include Chautauqua Lake, which experiences frequent harmful algal blooms throughout the summer and fall, and Lake George and Skaneateles Lake, which have small, infrequent blooms. Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have become a widely discussed topic as scientists begin to understand their impacts on the environment. Algae growth is a normal and necessary part of a functioning lake ecosystem, but issues are raised when conditions lead to an overgrowth of toxic algae, better known as harmful algal bloom, Hrycik explained. “Unfortunately, we have several lakes in the area that have harmful algal blooms, such as Chautauqua Lake and some parts of Lake Erie. Continuing research helps us learn how to predict these blooms and ultimately, how to better prevent them from happening,” said Hrycik, whose HABs research has grown to include sampling efforts in Chautauqua Lake. Hrycik began researching HABs in 2014, when tap water was found to contain toxins due to HABs in Lake Erie. She was enrolled in a master’s program at the time. Hrycik then studied HABs more intently when pursuing her Ph.D. Hrycik, who joined the Department of Biology in January 2023, works for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) and the Jefferson Project, a collaboration between RPI and IBM Research that seeks to understand human impacts on lake ecosystems. On campus, she is collaborating with Associate Professor Courtney Wigdahl-Perry, an aquatic biologist whose research includes lake ecology, water quality, and harmful algal blooms, and her students, and looks forward to building more formal collaborations. Dr. Wigdahl-Perry will provide opening remarks before Hrycik begins her presentation. Prior to her SUNY Fredonia appointment, Hrycik was a research scientist at another university, working on benthic invertebrate and water quality monitoring in the Great Lakes. Hrycik has a Ph.D. in Biology from the University of Vermont, an M.S. in Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences from Purdue University, and a B.S. in Natural Resources, with distinction in research, from Cornell University. Current projects of Hrycik include monitoring lake bottom algae, understanding nutrient inputs from the Chautauqua Lake watershed and working with colleagues on Lake George and Chautauqua Lake to understand the different drivers of algae blooms in different lake types. Brown Bag talks are supported by the Carnahan Jackson Fund for the Humanities of the Fredonia College Foundation. Food and refreshments are furnished by the Faculty Student Association.

We can’t stop peeing, but we can upgrade our wastewater plants. by Guananí Gómez-Van Cortright July 10, 2023 Share This: How to be HAB-smart this summer HABs, or harmful algal blooms, are hard to predict. No one knows whether another one will strike the Bay again this summer, but researchers are monitoring water quality with surveys and discoloration with satellite data (which detects the chlorophyll in the algae). Be safe: Want to check for reported blooms before you go to a local beach or swimming hole? Check the California Water Monitoring Council HAB report map . Help out: If you see discolored water, an algal mat, or other evidence of a potential harmful bloom, report it to the California Water Board here or via San Francisco Baykeeper’s pollution hotline . Starting in July 2022, a dark, reddish-brown tinge crept across San Francisco Bay, leaving dead fish in its wake. Carcasses piled up, first on the shores of Alameda and Lake Merritt, then South Bay, then all the way to Point Pinole. In a matter of weeks, more than 800 sturgeon and countless other fish perished from a lack of oxygen and, possibly, algal toxins. Last summer’s “algaepocalypse” was the Bay’s worst harmful algae bloom ever recorded. Since then, officials from wildlife, water, and health agencies have been scrambling to piece together what happened—and how future algae blooms might be prevented. Ten months later, they are just starting to get answers. One human-caused driver has been clear from the start—the sheer amount of nutrients flowing into the Bay that fed the algae, via wastewater, agricultural runoff, fertilizer, and urban runoff. The key elements in this mix are excess nitrogen and phosphorus, which feed algal blooms. This nutrient pollution problem will be very hard to fix. “While we don’t understand what triggered the harmful algal bloom last summer, we do understand that it wouldn’t have been able to grow to the magnitude that it did without nutrients in the bay,” says Lorien Fono, executive director of the Bay Area Clean Waters Agencies , which represents the 37 wastewater treatment plants that collectively discharge more than 121,000 pounds of nitrogen into the San Francisco Bay every day. Publicly owned wastewater treatment plants around the Bay, as mapped in a Bay Area Clean Water Agencies 2018 report on the costs of reducing nutrient loads. That report noted that the Bay’s “historic resilience to the effects of nutrient enrichment may be weakening. (Map by Bay Area Clean Water Agencies ) Now, researchers and water agencies are searching for ways to lower the risk of another worst-case bloom by reducing the amount of nutrients in the Bay. There are currently no tried and true techniques to prevent or treat harmful algae blooms, and even reducing the nutrients that fuel their growth has proven to be a political, financial, and technological challenge. Over the course of August 2022, a record-breaking harmful algae bloom spread throughout the entire San Francisco Bay. This map was produced with the help of a satellite that detects the chlorophyll-a produced by algae. (Map by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Bloom and bust Of all the factors that create conditions for runaway algae growth, nutrient pollution is the only big one that humans directly control. Nitrogen in particular is the main nutrient limiting algae’s growth in the Bay, so when there’s a lot of it floating around— and the water is warm, stagnant, and suffused with sunlight—algae can boom. But once the algae have used up all the nutrients, they bust—all dying at once. This is what creates the dreaded low-oxygen “dead zone” that asphyxiates fish and other wildlife. Some algae can also make deadly toxins that poison wildlife, harm pets and contaminate drinking water, depending on which species wins the bloom lottery. “We can’t control the strength of the tides, can’t really control climate change in our region or the amount of fog over the Bay, we can’t control sun distribution,” says Ian Wren, staff scientist at San Francisco Baykeeper. “Given the fact that we know that the vast majority of the nutrients are derived from municipal wastewater treatment plants, that’s a place to start.” San Francisco Bay has long been one of the most nutrient-rich bodies of water in the world, and most of the annual load comes from wastewater treatment plants—65 percent. The other big sources are agricultural and urban runoff containing nitrogen fertilizers and other chemicals. But that flushing is mostly restricted to rainy winter months, while algae blooms are more likely to happen during the dry season, when it’s hotter and less water is mixing into the Bay. “The summertime sources are predominantly wastewater,” says Bergamaschi. For decades, we were lucky. Plentiful sun-blocking fog and sediment suspended in the water, the mixing of the tides, and abundant filter-feeding clams all worked together to keep the Bay’s algae in check, despite all the nitrogen flowing into it. But that delicate balance seems to be shifting. The water is becoming less silty, allowing sunlight to reach greater depths. The air is less foggy, which leads to warmer water. Bloom-boosting summer heat waves are becoming more common. Heterosigma akashiwo , the algae species that boomed in summer 2022’s devastating harmful algal bloom, was dubbed the ‘flying potato ‘ by graduate students who studied it. (Photo courtesy of William Cochlan) Heterosigma akashiwo , the protist that devastated the Bay last year, was previously considered a “species of low concern,” showing that even an under-the-radar species can wreak havoc under certain conditions—and that San Francisco Bay is not immune to megablooms. Now experts fear that HABs in the Bay could become more frequent. What’s at stake, says Wren from San Francisco Baykeeper, is the health of the Bay. “Our fisheries are already in dire straits,” Wren says. “And they can’t really handle much more acute shots like this.” What will it take to reduce nutrients? Reducing nutrients isn’t easy. It would require major infrastructure rehauls that a 2018 report estimated would cost $10–15 billion across all the Bay Area’s treatment plants. This would likely raise water bills for Bay Area residents. Federal funding for infrastructure improvements and climate change solutions, including through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act , could potentially help pay for wastewater upgrades, though accessing that money is not straightforward. “In theory, we could go after these funds, if and when they’re made available, but it’s definitely not a slam dunk,” says Fono. Currently, wastewater treatment plants convert ammonia from urine into nitrate, and then the nitrate goes into the Bay. One possible upgrade is to install tanks where nitrate can be converted into gaseous nitrogen, which would then disperse into the air. In 2021, the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant completed a multibillion-dollar upgrade that successfully reduced its nitrogen discharge by two-thirds. Bergamaschi’s research team studied the water quality in the river by the plant before and after the upgrade, and found that water quality did improve—but only near the plant. Yet Bergamaschi says upgrading wastewater treatment to reduce nutrient pollution is nonetheless an essential next step in preventing more blooms. “If we want to ensure that we’re protecting our aquatic ecosystems in the Bay, we have to at least take some sort of nutrient mitigation approach,” says Bergamaschi. Data from late June shows a rather unsurprising bloom in the oft-troubled Clear Lake, to the north. Here, satellite imagery is used to calculate cyanobacterial abundance over the past 10 days. This is a screenshot from an interactive map produced by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the San Francisco Estuary Institute’s Aquatic Science Center, and the state Water Boards. For now, it appears to show a clear San Francisco Bay, but that’s because this type of data reveals freshwater, not marine, blooms. But soon it will show both—in July 2023, the Water Boards in contract with SFEI was working to update the tool to include chlorophyll-a, which can indicate marine blooms. Because wastewater treatment improvements will be so expensive, Fono, of the wastewater agency coalition, is determined to promote projects with multiple benefits, including so-called “nature-based solutions.” Specially designed wetlands could filter out nutrients while providing wildlife habitat and protecting communities from flooding or sea-level rise. Palo Alto and Hayward’s wastewater plants are working on pilot projects that incorporate wetlands into their treatment systems. The Bay Area needs new treatment technology, Fono says, to handle its nutrient pollution sustainably and keep up with the Bay Area’s high-density urban population. “You can’t tell people to stop peeing,” says Fono. “What I would urge in terms of a call to action is to understand where your wastewater goes. And if your agency has the opportunity to implement a solution that brings your community multiple benefits, especially in terms of climate change resilience, then support that in any way you can through the public process.” About the Author Guananí Gómez-Van Cortright Guananí Gómez-Van Cortright started as Bay Nature ’s first editorial fellow in July 2022 and is a recent graduate of the UC Santa Cruz Science Communication master’s program.

(MLive file photo) By Brad Devereaux | bdeverea@mlive.com ALLEGAN COUNTY, MI -- Suspected harmful algal blooms were detected in a west Michigan lake, prompting a warning from county health officials. The Allegan County Health Department said on Thursday, June 29, it received positive results from preliminary testing of suspected blue-green algae, known as cyanobacteria or harmful algal blooms, at Swan Lake in Cheshire Township. Samples will be sent to the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for additional testing. Health officials recommend visitors and residents of the lake avoid water-related activities and keep pets from drinking or going in the lake water, where the bloom is visible, until sampling for testing is complete, or the bloom breaks up. Advisory signs have been posted around the lake, the health department said. Summer is the peak season for this type of algae that can present health hazards. In Michigan, algal blooms typically occur during warm temperatures, sun, and high nutrient levels. It is not possible to determine whether algal blooms contain harmful toxins by looking at them, so it is best to avoid contact with any body of water covered with algal mats or significant rafts of algae on the surface, the health department said. Health officials offered these tips: Avoid areas with scummy water in the lake or water that looks like spilled paint or pea soup, floating scum, or has a green sheen. These may contain flecks, mats, foam, sheens, streaks, or clumps. Avoid water-related activities in areas where the bloom is visible. Individuals that have skin contact, swallow large amounts, or play in the water are susceptible to illness. Keep pets from drinking or playing in the lake water. Symptoms of illness often appear quicker in animals than humans – sometimes in minutes to a few hours. Symptoms in animals can include vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, staggered walking, excessive salivation, convulsions, erratic behavior, physical distress, and death. Use caution when boating or skiing in the water with harmful algal blooms. Use an unaffected part of the lake. Use caution if eating fish from impacted bodies of water. When a harmful algal bloom is present, the fish may contain small amounts of cyanotoxins. Do not water lawns or gardens with water from lake water. If you or your pet(s) have been exposed: Shower yourself and pet(s) immediately Contact your medical provider or veterinarian if you or your pet have ingested or been exposed Contact Poison Control at 800-222-1222 or call your medical provider if you have been exposed to or swallowed water with harmful algal blooms and have symptoms Report suspicious-looking algae to EGLE by calling the Environmental Assistance Center at (800) 662-9278 or by emailing AlgaeBloom@michigan.gov .

ITHACA, N.Y.—The season’s first reported harmful algal bloom (HAB) has been found in Cayuga Lake, though Tompkins County Whole Health (TCWH) stated that the discovered bloom was found “in northern portions of Cayuga Lake.” The statement from TCWH does not say other HABs have been found closer to the Ithaca- or Tompkins County-adjacent sections of Cayuga Lake. Though at least one has been reported in the lake, places where HABs are not visible are safe for swimming and other such festivities. “Tompkins County Whole Health urges residents and visitors to be aware of HABs,” the statement reads. “These blooms can occur in any calm body of water and may produce toxins that are harmful to people and animals. Do not drink the water and avoid contact with the water if it appears discolored or has an unpleasant odor. Do not allow pets to swim in water where suspicious cyanobacteria blooms are present.” The statement continues that high temperatures and runoff from rain can increase the likelihood of HABs forming. The following is information from Tompkins County Whole Health: Identifying HABs: It might be cyanobacteria if you see: strongly colored water, paint-like appearance, blue-green oily swirls, parallel green streaks, floating mats or scum.

Sarah Bowman Indianapolis Star The temperatures are rising and schools are letting out for the summer. That means people are donning their swimsuits and taking to the outdoors. Indiana has numerous lakes and reservoirs across the state that are hot spots for recreation ― from the dunes on Lake Michigan and Eagle Creek Reservoir in Indianapolis to Lake Monroe in Bloomington and the Ohio River marking Indiana's southerner border. This is also a time for homeowners to be tending to their yards and farmers to be planting. That means more fertilizer could be making its way into waterways. And that can lead to algae issues. For this edition of the Scrub Hub, we are looking into the questions: What are the risks of algae blooms? And what can families do to stay safe? To answer these questions, we looked at the data and resources available from Indiana's state agencies , including the departments of Environmental Management and Natural Resources. Scrub Hub: What is 'No Mow May' and should you do it? It could help save our pollinators Short answer: Steer clear of blue-green algae When temperatures rise and the sun beats down, conditions are ripe for the state's lakes to produce harmful algal blooms . One of the most prevalent and problematic is called blue-green algae. Despite its name, blue-green algae isn't actually an algae at all ― rather, it's a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria. These bacteria are often present in bodies of water, but under the right conditions they can grow quickly and explode into a ""bloom."" You've probably seen them: They can look like spilled green paint or pea soup. Sometimes they can blanket large areas or cover small pockets of a body of water. Not all algal blooms are dangerous, but some varieties can be toxic to humans and animals. Those who are exposed might experience vomiting, diarrhea, headache, a cough or sore throat, and skin or eye irritation. The level of exposure can depend on the type and length of activities. You can become sick from having skin contact with the water or accidentally swallowing or breathing in airborne water droplets while boating, swimming, tubing, etc. Unfortunately it's hard to tell what algae is toxic just from looking at it, that's what the state's sampling program is for. Long answer: Tracking water bodies Both IDEAM and DNR work to track the occurrence and spread of algae in Indiana's waterways where human and animal contact is most prevalent. IDEM samples selected swimming areas at various state parks and recreation areas for blue-green algae and toxins between Memorial Day and Labor Day, and those weekly results are posted on the Indiana Reservoir and Lake Sampling Update site. Sampling of the DNR's swimming beaches began May 15 for the recreation season , in preparation of the agency opening them on Memorial Day weekend. They sample for four different algal toxins, including microcystins (which are the most common). The agency compares the cyanobacteria levels to the guidelines from the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It uses an action level of 100,000 cells of cyanobacteria per milliliter to post beach advisory signs. Based on the recent sampling that was completed, there were no beaches that reached the level to be closed . Just two beaches were at advisory alert level ― Whitewater Lake and Brookeville Lake ― meaning swimming and boating is permitted but the agencies recommend washing with soapy water after coming in contact with lake water and to avoid swallowing while swimming. They also advise not allowing pets to swim or drink water where algae is present. Several beaches were at the low risk level, which recommends not drinking water and, again, showing after swimming. Several counties and other organizations will collect samples from within their areas. Hamilton County conducts sampling for Geist Reservoir, for example. The Lilly Center at Grace College samples from lakes in Kosciusko County. There also is a beach monitoring and notification program that tests for E. coli bacteria at Lake Michigan's beaches. Scrub Hub: How can I attract butterflies to my yard or garden? One other key to staying safe is to reduce blue-green algae within the state's waterways. IDEM says there are many ways to minimize and stop nutrient inputs into Indiana's waters, including steps homeowners can take in their own backyard. The agency's recommendations include : Most established lawns do not need phosphorus to be healthy, so consider skipping your application. If applying fertilizer, use a phosphorus-free lawn fertilizer. This is critical if you live on a lake, IDEM said. Lawn-fertilizer packaging is labeled with three numbers for nutrient content. A zero as the middle number (phosphorus content) indicates a phosphorus-free fertilizer. Do not over fertilize in your garden. Check soil nutrient levels prior to applying garden fertilizer to ensure correct application. Soil test kits can be purchased from some local hardware stores and through online distributors. Do not fertilize up to the edge of a waterway. Check with your local government for any specific setback requirements. Do not dispose of grass clippings or leaves in or near a waterway. To prevent inputs from human waste, have your septic system inspected and tank pumped out at least every two years. If conducting land disturbing activity, prevent soil and organic matter from washing into waterways, as soil can carry nutrients into the waterway.

													the following attributes while ensuring the content's credibility: fact-checked reputable news agency proofread Eight Colorado lakes suspected of toxic algae blooms: Why it is becoming worse by Elise Schmelzer, The Denver Post Credit: Unsplash/CC0 Public Domain Colorado's lakes serve as a needed respite during sweltering summer days, but as climate warms, the state's lakes are becoming more susceptible to toxic blooms of algae. Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have closed several lakes to swimming and other recreation over recent weeks due to toxic algae blooms that can sicken swimmers and kill pets. The agency closed parts of Cherry Creek Reservoir on Sunday, as well as the swim beach at North Sterling Reservoir. At least four lakes and reservoirs across the state have tested positive for toxins so far this summer: Deweese Reservoir outside Westcliffe, Road Canyon Reservoir south of Lake City, Barr Lake near Brighton and Cherry Creek Reservoir outside Denver, according to data collected by Colorado Public Health and Environment. Possible blooms have been reported in eight others, including Blue Heron Lake at St. Vrain State Park outside Longmont. The number of algae blooms will increase as Colorado's climate becomes warmer, said Ed Hall, a scientist at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory at Colorado State University. Even an increase in water temperatures of one or two degrees can exponentially increase algae growth , he said. ""In the face of human-caused climate change, the slight change in warmer temperatures can lead to an explosion in algal growth,"" Hall said. CDPHE tests different lakes and reservoirs every year for algae under a program they began in 2019, said Sarah Erickson, a scientist with the department. Other entities—like municipalities or water utilities —also do their own testing of other lakes, she said. There is no statewide repository of data on algae blooms. The blue-green algae found in the lakes are naturally occurring and an important part of the ecosystem. But the blooms can produce toxins if they grow big enough. Harmful algae looks like thick pea soup or spilled paint with a green, red, gold or turquoise color. They also often have foam or scum. ""When in doubt, stay out,"" Erickson said. ""That's a good rule of thumb."" Symptoms of algae exposure include skin irritation , diarrhea, stomach pain, fever, headache or a sore throat. The toxins can be fatal to pets, like dogs that swim in the waters. Algae blooms are one of the most visible consequences of climate change in Colorado, Hall said. Lakes that people are used to swimming in to cool off are closing more often. Waters that used to be blue and clear are instead covered in green algae. Not all blooms are toxic, but even the non-toxic kind impact waters. When blooms die, they pull oxygen out of the water column, which can lead to large fish kills, Hall said. Blooms have impacted many Denver-area lakes and reservoirs. Denver public health officials closed access to Sloan's Lake in 2021 due to algae. Cherry Creek Reservoir tested positive for toxins in 2014, 2016, 2020 and 2022, according to CDPHE. Barr Lake has tested positive for toxins every year since 2019. Even high alpine lakes with few human visitors are experiencing increased blooms. A study of two popular lakes in Rocky Mountain National Park—Sky Pond and Loch Vale—found that the green algae on the bottom of the lakes have grown dramatically since 2010. Concentrations of the algae and cyanobacteria are more than 200% higher than in 1950, according to the research. Scientists attributed the increase in part to warmer summers. ""It's not a small problem, and it's not going to get any better without concerted effort,"" Hall said. Coloradans can help prevent toxic algae blooms by avoiding lawn and garden fertilizer that includes phosphorus, Hall said. When it rains, the nutrient is washed into streams and lakes and gives algae the food it needs to grow. ""The same compounds that make tomatoes look great are great for algae,"" Hall said. Coloradans also need to pick up their animals' waste and refrain from using de-icers that contain urea, a form of nitrogen, according to CDPHE. Algae blooms typically recede as the weather cools or if wind or storm mixes the water, according to CDPHE. 2023 MediaNews Group, Inc. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC. Citation :

Here's why Excess phosphorus and other nutrients can create a green film on waterbodies. Who is to blame? Peter Mantius and other activists point to the DEC and its presumptions about agricultural pollutants. Jacob Mack Ithaca Journal Harmful algal blooms have appeared in Cayuga Lake for nearly a decade now, but this year, it’s had more than any other body of water in the state according to the New York State Department Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Ithaca-based environmental data firm Toxics Targeting released a new statewide map tracking over 180 harmful algal blooms Tuesday and urged Gov. Kathy Hochul to take immediate action to eliminate harmful blooms across New York in a letter it sent to her office that same day. “Harmful algal blooms are caused by excessive nutrients, notably phosphorus, released into lakes, rivers, streams and other waterbodies from sewage discharges and uncontrolled agricultural and stormwater runoff,” the firm said in a statement. “Phosphorus essentially fertilizes the growth of cyanobacteria that cause the blooms, and they can occur in warm weather months and persist until cold weather.” Cayuga Lake blooms The first signs of the blooms in Cayuga Lake this year appeared in early summer, with over 30 appearing in June alone. Since, the number of harmful blooms in the lake grown to at least 60 according to the DEC’s Harmful Algal Bloom Reporting and Notifications system . In the past two weeks, 17 new algal blooms on Cayuga Lake were reported to the DEC , according to its harmful algal bloom reporting system. The same number of harmful blooms, 17, cropped up in the neighboring Seneca lake in the same time frame, and only one ""small localized"" bloom in Owasco Lake, east of Cayuga Lake. Identifying harmful blooms It is hard to tell a harmful algal bloom from your typical non-damaging algal bloom, according to NYSDEC. Algal blooms may have the appearance of spilled green paint, and typically exist in areas with environmental conditions including excess nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen); lots of sunlight; low-water, flow conditions, or calm water; and warm temperatures. Harmful blooms may be short-lived, appearing and disappearing in hours, or long-lived, persisting for several weeks or more, depending on water conditions. Safety around the blooms, how to report a bloom People and animals should avoid contact with any floating mats, scums, or discolored water, NYSDEC said. People should never drink, prepare food, cook, or make ice with untreated surface water, and in-home treatments such as boiling the water or disinfecting it with chlorine or ultraviolet light filtration units does not protect consumers from bloom toxins. People recreating in and on the water should be aware of the potential for HABs in any waterbody they consider using. A list of New York waterbodies with bloom reports is available on the DEC’s HAB notifications page , OPEN NY , or through Toxic Targeting . The risk for exposure while swimming is greater when blooms cover a large part of a waterbody or when water sample results show a bloom is present in the open water.

Provided/TRPA While out enjoying an afternoon on one of Lake Tahoe’s sandy beaches over the past few years, you might have noticed large mats of decomposing algae washing up or floating nearby. The lake’s famed blue waters are facing another threat while the battles of climate change and invasive species wage on — and it’s all very much connected. Nearshore algae blooms are a burgeoning ecological threat to Tahoe. Not only do they impact the experience for beachgoers, but they also degrade water quality and, in some cases, pose a threat of toxicity. Over the last 50 years, the rate of algal growth has increased sixfold, according to U.C. Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center’s 2022 State of the Lake Report. Between 2021 and 2022 alone, the amount of algae growing in the lake jumped up 300%. There are two general communities of algae in Tahoe: periphytic algae — the slimy green algae clinging to rocks — and the free-floating metaphytic algae. “We’ve got the same amount of slime on our rocks as we had roughly in the early 80s,” explains Dan Segan, principal natural resource analyst at the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. “The nuisance algae washing up on the beaches is a more recent occurrence.” Though the algae is native, in the past, normal conditions have kept the population levels low. Tahoe is an oligotrophic lake, meaning it’s deep, cold, clear and low in nutrients that are needed to support large populations of aquatic plants, animals or algae. But as the climate has become warmer, drier and characterized by extreme weather variability, the lake’s temperature has continued to rise . The average water surface temperature of Lake Tahoe in 1968 (the year monitoring began) was 50.4 degrees Fahrenheit, but in 2021, it was 53.1 degrees, the third warmest year on record. “The lake is warming every year along with climate change, which is great if you’re someone wanting to swim on our beaches — we get to 70 degrees in our nearshore and shallow waters of Tahoe these days — but it also makes it more hospitable for algae and algae growth,” notes Segan. “There’s clearly a dynamic there between the warming waters and the ecological change in the lake.” The nuisance algal blooms have become an issue over the last decade as they degrade water quality and decompose on Tahoe’s beaches. Provided/TRPA INVASIVE ISSUES So far, most of the algal blooms have been concentrated in South Lake Tahoe and Tahoe City. In South Lake Tahoe, a large toxic bloom popped up near the mouth of the Upper Truckee River in fall 2021. The following spring, a much larger bloom of attached algae grew along six miles of Tahoe City’s shoreline. U.C. Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (TERC) has been monitoring the lake’s algae — among many other environmental metrics — for decades. Their latest research project is examining the relationship between the rise in algal blooms and the growing population of invasive Asian clams. These non-native bivalves were first discovered on Lake Tahoe’s South Shore in 2002. Since then, despite numerous agencies’ best efforts, the population has spread around the lake, with the largest numbers concentrated on the southeast shores. The clams eat algae from the water, but their excrement creates a concentration of nutrients that allows the algae to grow beyond its normal means. “We first started seeing clams in real numbers around 2008 in Marla Bay, and two years later, we had a fairly large algal bloom there. It washed up on the beaches, and there was a lot of speculation at the time because we hadn’t really identified the linkage between the clams and the algae,” says Brant Allen, the field lab director with TERC. “As the clams spread around the lake and became fairly high in density, we started seeing these algal blooms following the high density of clams around the lake.” Warming waters and lower lake levels are also contributing factors to the rise in algal blooms. Provided/TRPA UPPING THE TECH In 2017, TERC expanded its algae-monitoring program to include aerial data collection from an instrumented helicopter and drone. Combined with the original practice of divers collecting samples from a fixed set of locations, the researchers are now able to better understand how the areas affected by algae are shifting as water levels, temperature and clam populations fluctuate. TERC is also exploring ways to mitigate the algal blooms, including getting at the source of the issue that they can control: the invasive clams. Bottom barriers laid across the areas where populations are high cut off the clams from oxygen in the water, but the process is costly and slow. The mats need to sit in place for a month during the summer or 3-4 months during the winter to kill the clams, and it’s not 100% effective. “It’s very difficult to make sure that you’ve covered all of the clams. Unless you have a very localized population, the bottom barriers are very difficult to use for eradication,” notes Allen. The agency is in the preliminary stages of another approach for algae control, which would use a vacuum-like device to suck the algae from the water. After collecting the bloom, TERC would dry out the algae and compost it for resale to offset the cost of the process. TOXIC BLOOMS Across the country, toxic algae blooms have made headlines over the last few years. “We’re lucky in Tahoe because the harmful algal bloom concerns are primarily for stagnant, warmer waters. But the area where we’ve seen the most concern is in the Tahoe Keys,” explains TRPA’s Segan, pointing to the high-concentration of invasive aquatic plants impeding the flow of water in the South Shore neighborhood’s already slow-moving, man-made lagoons. (Numerous mitigation efforts are underway, and have been for years, to address the Key’s high concentration of invasive species that have proliferated in the mostly stagnant water.) The vast majority of the algae that you’ll see on Tahoe’s beaches and in open water is not a human health concern, says Segan. However, last summer, harmful algal blooms were discovered on the South Shore along Regan, Barton and Kiva beaches and in the Tahoe Keys waterways. Formed by tiny organisms called cyanobacteria, these blooms can make the water green, white, red, or brown. In Lake Tahoe, the harmful algal blooms can look like a thick layer of paint floating on the water or a scummy mat along the shoreline. Most often it is a bright shade of green. Testing of Tahoe’s water and algae is ongoing, and signage will indicate advisory levels from “Caution” to “Warning” to “Danger.” “We can’t control the water temperature, but there’s pretty robust plans in Tahoe to prevent nutrients from getting into the water,” notes Segan. “All of the watershed protections we have in place prevent the nutrients from getting into the lake that cause algae in the first place. Prevention is the best cure.” More Like This, Tap A Topic news Environment U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reopens public comment period on proposal to list the Western Pond Turtle under the Endangered Species Act Apr 4, 2024 Town of Truckee asks residents to join the conversation about river revitalization efforts Apr 4, 2024 Visit Truckee-Tahoe funds $17,500 for Donner Lake peak season study Mar 30, 2024 The remarkable return of Sandhill Cranes Mar 28, 2024 Truckee Town Council moves forward with findings from biomass, bioenergy study Mar 27, 2024 See more Support Local Journalism Donate Support Local Journalism Readers around Lake Tahoe, Truckee, and beyond make the Sierra Sun's work possible.

                    By Farah Siddiqi/ Michigan News Connection Published July 17, 2023 at 6:56 AM CDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email sunday_morning - stock.adobe.com / 455804060 Algal bloom in water Michigan residents are being warned to be prepared for another season of harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy is advising people on what to do if they encounter the algae. One environmental group is convinced it's being caused by thermal discharge from nuclear plants. Jesse Deer in Water, community organizer for the watchdog group Citizens' Resistance at Fermi Two, the nuclear plant in Monroe County, said the plant's discharge is full of toxins but people rarely hear about it, because the data comes from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""The thermal discharge is the heat from the process of the cooling that's left over in the water,"" Deer in Water explained. ""It comes out at temperatures well above the average, and damages the ecosystems and fish, and the heat from it helps harmful algal blooms dominate the waters there locally."" The group is demanding more regulation and cleaner energy sources, saying nuclear power is neither ""clean"" nor ""emission-free."" State agencies sample lake water for harmful algal blooms, but recommend people use a ""stick test"" if they see something odd. If it can't be picked up with a stick or paddle and looks like spilled green paint, it could be toxic, and should be reported right away to the Environmental Assistance Center at 800-662-9278. Residents of Newport and Monroe County can check the state's Harmful Algal Bloom Map to help them avoid toxic waters. The state pointed out breathing in or swallowing water with algal blooms can cause a host of symptoms, from difficulty breathing, vomiting and diarrhea, to weakness or numbness, headaches or dizziness. Graham Denton, a Monroe County resident and member of The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes, said he's always concerned for his family's health when they are at the lake. ""We visit a website every time we go to the lake with our dog or our son now, and we're checking the algae bloom,"" Denton noted. ""We live in the area that's the western point of Lake Erie and so, we were shocked to see some of these articles come out and say, 'Hey don't let your dogs swim here, don't let your kids swim here when it's like that.' That's pretty shocking."" Back in 2014, the algal blooms were so bad in the western basin of Lake Erie, they affected access to drinking water for residents of the area.

(Credit: Courtney Flatt / Northwest News Network) Listen A large algal bloom on the Snake River officially has died off. The toxic algae stretched about 30 miles along the river this past fall. https://www.nwpb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/011224CF_AlgalBloomUpdate.mp3 (Runtime 0:53) Read After nearly three months, the Whitman County Health Department has lifted its alert for the large algal bloom that spanned parts of the Snake River in eastern Washington. The neon-green scum could be seen from the air – and emitted a pungent smell from the ground. Maddy Lucas, with the Health Department, collected samples this fall. In an earlier interview she said, “In the areas where this scum is thick, it’s this neon-green milkshake consistency across the river and it smells pretty awful.” To lift its health advisory, the Department needed to collect two consecutive samples below toxicity levels. The first sample that tested below toxicity levels happened in late December. Water sampling initially identified the bloom in September. This bloom was the first large bloom that health department officials said they had seen on the Snake River. High concentrations of the toxic algae can cause liver damage in people and pets, which meant everyone had to stay out of the water. The toxins also accumulate in fish so officials suggested people be careful when selecting where they fished if they were consuming their catch. “Residents and visitors are still advised not to recreate in active blooms,” according to a news release from the Department, “and to report them to the Washington State Department of Ecology if they are observed.” Health departments around Washington reported more harmful algal blooms than usual this past summer and fall. Officials say high nutrient runoffs and warm, stagnant waters contribute to increasing algal blooms. The problem is expected to worsen as the climate continues to change. In an earlier interview, department officials said they planned to prepare more extensive sampling to monitor for future toxic algal blooms.

Wren found that the recent harmful algal blooms in the water have now diminished. (Juliana Yamada/KQED) The red tide that gave East Bay waters a light brown sheen earlier this month is likely over, declared the environmental watchdog group San Francisco Baykeeper Monday. “I would say this bloom is done for now,” said the group’s staff scientist Ian Wren on a boat under the eastern half of the Bay Bridge, where the water was olive green instead of a murky tea color brought on by the bloom. “Almost overnight the bloom died and the water was crystal clear,” he added. ‘We don’t have enough knowledge of the species. Warmer weather could bring it back and we will continue to monitor the situation.’ Eileen White, executive officer, San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board Even though the red tide has dissipated, Eileen White, executive officer of the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board, is hesitant “to declare victory.” “It is still summertime and at this time I am cautiously optimistic,” she said. “We don’t have enough knowledge of the species. Warmer weather could bring it back and we will continue to monitor the situation.” Last year the red tide — literally billions of tiny algae called Heterosigma akashiwo — killed an immeasurable amount of fish. This year, the algae killed fewer than 100, according to a state-run citizen science project . Sitings of important Bay Area species, including sturgeons, bat rays and crabs, were among the dead. Waves from the San Francisco Baykeeper splash in Oakland, on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2023. (Juliana Yamada/KQED) “I am so happy it’s only 85 fish and I am glad it didn’t spread to the South Bay,” White said. Over the last week, Wren said citizen scientists monitoring the bloom looked at bay water “under the microscope and couldn’t find any of the problem algae.” Sponsored The microscopic critter looks like a swimming potato chip with a tail, said Raphael Kudela, a phytoplankton ecologist at UC Santa Cruz. He said the organism thrives in the bay because the shallow water warms up quickly. “It’s just really happy when it’s in the bay,” he said. “As long as it’s happy, it’s just going to keep going, and going, and going.” Wren, with SF Baykeeper, isn’t exactly sure what cut the bloom short this year. Still, he said there are a few theories as to why the algae didn’t return in force: it could have been too cloudy decreasing light, it wasn’t warm enough, the bay waters mixed causing the algae to die off or there weren’t enough concentrations of tiny particles in the water that the algae like to dine on. ‘With the bloom getting so big and widespread last year, it is highly likely a lot more cysts are present throughout the bay, ready to spark again.’ Ian Wren, staff scientist, SF Baykeeper Wren said output from the region’s 37 regional wastewater treatments is a big part of why the algae blooms can get so bad. The wastewater includes nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen, which the algae go to town on. “There could have been a lower level of nutrients to start with and this bloom could have just fizzled out naturally, eating what it could and never having the chance to take off,” he said. Scientists like Wren and Peter Roopnarine, curator of invertebrate zoology and geology at the California Academy of Sciences, said humans are the main reason why this algae bloom got so bad. He blames wastewater agencies almost continually pumping nutrient-filled water into the bay and a warming world because of the burning of fossil fuels globally. The San Francisco Baykeeper is seen in the Oakland Marina in Oakland on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2023. (Juliana Yamada/KQED) “It’s almost all about us to blame,” said Roopnarine. “The bay is kind of a gigantic laboratory flask in some ways where you can put in ingredients, can mix them and it’s not easy for those to have an outside influence from the ocean.” Wren said the tide is unlikely to return this year, but just because the red tide has disappeared doesn’t mean it won’t come back next year. When under stress, the algae can create little cysts, like seeds, and plant themselves at the bottom of the bay, lying dormant until the right conditions for the organisms to proliferate return. Conditions include light, warmth and calm water. More Related Stories “With the bloom getting so big and widespread last year, it is highly likely a lot more cysts are present throughout the bay, ready to spark again,” Wren said. It’s sort of like a long-term easter egg hunt with potentially deadly consequences for fish, Wren said. The idea is that when the algae are present, the water holds less oxygen, killing the fish. The algae are not known to have any direct harmful effects on humans or mammals . “Given that we have had two back-to-back years of blooms, this likely could be the new normal,” he said. “We might see small, medium and large blooms on an annual basis.” A new normal because Wren said climate change likely means more algae blooms — and not just the lesser toxic bloom this year. “There are other harmful algae in the bay that could just as easily have taken off with more lethal consequences to wildfire and humans,” he said. “These algae are just waiting to go nuts.” lower waypoint KQED Get the best of KQED’s science coverage in your inbox weekly.

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work. Oh, that works really well,’” Mitchell said. “I want to laud them for trying it first.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>[ad floatright]\u003c/p>\n"",""blocks"":[],""excerpt"":""Following Gov.

It’s still in its infancy, so advocates say there’s still time for things to sort out. But already, the state had to bail out the program using tax dollars because it hadn’t made enough money from service fees and revenues.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Educating and training new facilitators — who work directly with individuals with mental challenges and who could need emergency help — has also been a hurdle. Organizations like the Synthesis Institute, which trained people to deliver psilocybin therapy, promised to revolutionize psychedelic-assisted therapy in Oregon. However, the school abruptly closed down in 2023 after going bankrupt.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“An issue there with Oregon that I think has come up is how well-trained the guides are and what they’re being used for,” said Mitchell of UCSF.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Marks, who served on the Oregon Psilocybin Advisory Board for a year, is also critical of how centers brand their services as “therapy” when, in fact, they are not yet FDA-approved. Instead of psychedelic-assisted therapy as it’s often branded, he said Oregon legalized “supported adult use of psilocybin” and points out that providers can’t diagnose medication conditions or make medical claims.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>It’s also proven to be unaffordable for many people who can’t pay out of pocket, reserving the new treatment approach for people who can pay for and travel to it. Several service centers have reported that the majority of their clients are \u003ca href=\""https://www.opb.org/article/2023/11/29/psilocybin-mushrooms-oregon-service-centers-price/\"">visitors from out of state\u003c/a>.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“My estimation of the average cost of a psilocybin treatment course in Oregon is from about $1,500 to $3,500, and that’s for a single dose,” Marks said. “That obviously could get pretty expensive pretty quickly and is not affordable for a lot of people.”\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Sen. Wiener’s bill incorporates some of the critiques from Oregon’s model. It also creates a new public-private fund that will promote education and safety around psychedelic substances, as well as guardrails against conflicts of interest among officials crafting psychedelic laws.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>According to the legislation, board members cannot have any immediate family with ownership or economic interest in any institution that’s engaged in psychedelic-assisted therapy education.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>As states roll out psilocybin decriminalization policies unevenly around the country, there’s increasingly room for inequitable opportunities and treatment outcomes, as well as drug enforcement challenges. But, believers say the inevitable kinks of the new policy will be worked out.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>“Hindsight’s 2020, so we can use Oregon as the beta tester and say, ‘Oh, that didn’t work.

Preventing Schizophrenia This research took us across the country, from New York to San Diego, to meet pioneers in the field of “prodromal” early intervention. This is the controversial idea that schizophrenia may be prevented before its formal onset, in children as young as 10.

""There are lots of different causes of algae blooms, and so there are lots of different consequences as well,"" says algal researcher Anne Thessen , PhD, associate professor in the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine . Most HAB events in Colorado consist of a blue-green algae, a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria. The bacteria are naturally occurring but can “bloom” when environmental conditions are right. Under some conditions, some types of cyanobacteria will produce toxins. If exposed to the toxins, humans and animals can experience side effects, ranging from a skin rash to neurological problems. Telltale signs of a harmful algae bloom In Colorado, like most inland places across the country, blooms tend to happen on a seasonal cycle. The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that HAB events peak in August — the majority occurring in bodies of fresh water. Variables such as temperature and light can drive a bloom. Thessen points to water column stratification, the formation of layers in water due to differences in water density, as another important factor in the manifestation of a bloom. ""When a sun shines onto a body of water, it heats the top but not so much the deeper you go,"" Thessen explains. ""The place where the temperature changes dramatically is called the thermocline. It acts as a barrier. Water column stability aids in the accumulation of that biomass at the surface.” The light, heat, and nutrients available in that top layer can help algae grow and multiply. When the cyanobacteria start to produce toxins, that’s when it can be harmful to people, pets, and wildlife. If the water looks bright green, turquoise, gold, or red in color, it might be a sign of an algal bloom. The cyanobacteria found in Colorado tends to be bright green — some experts describe the water as resembling pea soup. ""But just because the water is a weird color doesn’t always mean that there are toxins in the water,"" Thessen says. Yellow water, for example, can be the result of floating pollen. ""The water can look gross and smell gross and even cause fish to die, but there might not be any toxins in the water,” she explains. “This is usually because as a bloom decays, it draws all the oxygen out of the water and fish can suffocate. Other times, algae that have spines can get in a fish's gills and do a lot of physical damage."" Many lakes and bodies across the state are monitored for HAB events by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment , but it’s best to report a suspected bloom to a local health department or park ranger be safe, Thessen says. The length of a HAB event can depend on many factors, including weather or the availability of nutrients that feed the algae. “Sometimes a storm will come in or there's a lot of wind and it’ll mix up the water column,” Thessen says. “That causes the surface of the bloom to get folded into cooler, darker water where there isn’t as much light, and that can end the bloom.” HAB events prompt health, economic concerns Exposure to an algal bloom can be harmful to people, causing nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, fever, sore throat, and asthma flare-ups, depending on the type of exposure, Thessen says. “If you’re breathing in aerosols, you might experience some respiratory irritation, and if you’re swimming in an algal bloom, you may see a skin rash,” she says. ""A lot of toxins that cyanobacteria produce have a negative impact on your liver if ingested.” Pets that swim or drink in an algal bloom might experience low energy, excessive drooling, tremors, vomiting, and diarrhea. Exposed humans or pets experiencing symptoms after proximity to an algal bloom should seek medical attention. Studying algal blooms can help researchers learn more about what prolonged exposure might mean for health, Thessen says. It can also help scientists know how to prevent or mitigate a bloom. “If we can figure out what’s causing them, maybe there’s something that can be done to mitigate public health consequences,” she says. “There are also various economic and commercial impacts, too. People don’t like to spend their tourist dollars going to a gross, green, stinky lake.” Topics: Research , Awareness , Climate Science Featured Experts Anne Thessen, PhD Related Stories Research Artificial Intelligence (AI) The Next Frontier: Ethical Use and Advancements in Healthcare AI Kara Mason | April 8, 2024 Research Cancer Genetics Data analysis Could Creating a Genetic Risk Score Improve Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis?

Blue-green algal blooms return each summer to rivers in northeastern North Carolina and linger. The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality on July 18 issued a warning to avoid the Chowan River from Tyner on Indian Creek in northern Chowan County to Edenton. Related: Lingering Chowan River algal bloom prompts state advisory A 30-month program administered by the Albemarle Resource and Conservation Development Council is more than a year into looking at why the Chowan, Perquimans and Pasquotank rivers are so prone to the blue-green algal blooms that are caused by cyanobacteria feeding frenzies on nutrient-rich waters. These bacteria are potentially toxic to humans and animals and are associated with hypoxia, or deprivation of oxygen, in the water, leading to fish kills. Albemarle Resource and Conservation Development Council Executive Director Elizabeth Bryant, a longtime resident of the Edenton area, said the problem is significant and real, and affects the area’s most important resources.

And not touch the fish in the area. Obviously, that restricts tourism.” The council serves 10 northeastern North Carolina counties: Camden, Chowan, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hyde, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell and Washington. Bryant said the algal blooms can be breathtaking and affect towns across the region. “If you get out of your car, and you can hardly breathe because of the scent of algal blooms, you’re going to get back in your car,” she said. “That will inhibit tourism to Edenton to Elizabeth City.” Steve Karl, Colleen Karl’s husband and a member of the Chowan Edenton Environmental Group board, collects samples earlier this week from a tributary flowing into Potecasi Creek near Conway. Photo: Colleen Karl Some of the region’s smaller towns’ economies depend on the summer travelers to or from the Outer Banks, Bryant added. The 30-month-long study, Bryant noted, will yield data for the council’s entire service area. The grant requires gathering samples consistently throughout the year and, importantly, water samples are collected at tributaries and streams, and not necessarily the larger rivers. The study is funded through the Environmental Enhancement Grant program administered by the state attorney general’s office. The program is part of a 25-year agreement that resulted from the state’s hog waste pollution case settlement with Smithfield Foods. Attorney General Josh Stein, speaking at an event in May in Bertie County, said that in the 22 years since the agreement was signed, about 210 projects had been funded with awards totaling more than $40 million. Numerous awards have supported different strategies to improve water quality, Stein said. Colleen Karl is the chairperson of the Chowan Edenton Environmental Group . She and others in the organization are among the numerous amateur, or public, scientists who are gathering samples for analysis as part of the program. “It’s a very large watershed and we’re sampling on a lot of back roads,” she said. The Chowan Edenton Environmental Group is sampling the waters of Potecasi Creek, a tributary of the Chowan River that joins the river at almost the same location as the Meherrin River. “Some of those tributaries that come off Potecasi Creek, were earmarked as pretty high in nitrogen,” she said. Nitrogen and phosphorous have long been known to contribute to cyanobacteria blooms, but other factors have also been identified, including those related to climate change. Dr. Hans Paerl and Dr. Nathan Hall of the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences are analyzing the samples. Paerl, who has published papers on climate change and how it affects blue-green algae, explained that the organisms are influenced by changing weather patterns. “These bloom organisms are particularly sensitive to climate change, including overall warming of the globe’s atmosphere and water, but then also more extreme events, like bigger storms and bigger droughts,” Paerl said. “Those things have come into the equation to more or less complicate factors in terms of coming up with recommending management strategies.” Paerl has been studying the Chowan River watershed since the 1980s, when herring was still abundant in the river. “When I first started working there, they had big herring pickling places (where) I used to buy my herring over in Colerain,” he recalled. He was part of a team that came up with an early management plan for reducing the nutrient load entering the Chowan. “When I first got hired to look at the blooms on the Chowan River, that was back in 1980, I believe. We did a good job. We identified both nitrogen and phosphorus and came up with some recommendations for how much reductions needed to take place in terms of input of those nutrients, and it proved to be pretty effective,” Paerl said. It was a temporary reprieve. “Then 15 or 20 years later, the blooms returned to the Chowan — pretty much the same players. So now we’re trying to figure out what has happened in the interim,” he said. “We’re still really aiming for nutrient reductions. We may need to reduce them even more now than we did before. The additional thing is climate change.” But climate change does not completely explain why there has been an increase in algal blooms in rivers like the Chowan. As Hall explained, when the Albemarle Resource and Conservation Development Council first approached the researchers, they wanted to know where the nutrients had originated. In reviewing data and literature on nutrients in the rivers, a sudden spike wasn’t apparent. “We have flow gauges (on the rivers) and the Division of Water Resources measures the concentrations. So, we have flow, we have concentrations, we can calculate loads,” Hall said. “Those major rivers don’t look particularly spectacular as far as how much load. The concentrations in the rivers really aren’t that high.” What was apparent though was that relatively minor tributaries to the Albemarle Sound where gauges were in place or were otherwise monitored seemed to have significantly higher nutrient loads. “For the few small streams where we do have concentration data, like the Scuppernong River, the Pasquotank River, the Perquimans River — these are smaller tributaries to the Albemarle Sound area — the concentrations are really high,” Hall said. Those concentrations are also being found in the tributary streams — concentrations so high that they may be a significant contributing factor to algal blooms. “A lot of the smaller streams are three times higher concentration than the big rivers. So if they’re carrying a proportional amount of flow and they’re about 15% of the watershed, they’re carrying three times higher concentration, they could be 40% of the load,” Hall said. The study recently passed the 12-month mark, and there are still a number of unanswered questions. It remains unclear, for example, where or how the nitrogen is entering the river system. “The organic nitrogen component is something that’s increasing in a lot of the streams in North Carolina. And it’s been kind of a head-scratcher as to where it’s coming from,” Hall said. He explained that one of the goals of the project is to look across some of the streams that have different watershed and land-use characteristics, that are higher agriculture use, or include urban development, and try to investigate what the dissolved organic components look like. Land use may be the key to mitigating extreme algal blooms, but to date the role of land use, how it affects nutrient loads, is not completely clear. To North Carolina State University researcher Dr. Chris Osburn, who is analyzing the data, the information is by no means definitive. “Preliminary evidence points to changes in land use and climate (especially extreme rainfall events) that can mobilize DON (dissolved organic nitrogen) from wetlands and forested landscapes into tributaries, which could be driving some of the increases in DON observed in the Chowan River. Research into the sources of DON to these tributaries is ongoing,” Osburn responded to Coastal Review in an email. Even if the sources of nutrients that are creating algal blooms in the Albemarle Basin are identified, Paerl said limiting the blooms is about the best that can be accomplished. “We’re probably never going to be able to get rid of cyanobacteria in these slow-moving systems, and even in Albemarle Sound,” he said. “But we can keep it from getting worse.” He said that’s essentially the point of mitigation strategies: holding back an issue or a problem from getting worse. “After all, cyanobacteria have been around on Earth for 2 billion years. They’re not going to go away.” Filed Under: Environmental-Economic Connections in the Albemarle Region , Featured , Special Reports , Spotlight Tagged With: coastal economy , pollution , science , water quality Reprint this Story About Kip Tabb Kip Tabb is a freelance writer living on the Outer Banks.

Jason Gruenauer spoke with Nathan Moore with CDPHE’s Clean Water Program to ask: Is this normal, and when will the algae go away? By: Óscar Contreras Posted at 11:55 AM, Aug 01, 2023 and last updated 2023-08-02 00:49:47-04 DENVER – State health officials are asking Coloradans to be aware of toxic, blue-green algae when recreating in reservoirs and lakes this summer as the warmer weather is producing blooms that could be harmful to people and their pets. Already this year, three water sites across the state have been temporarily closed to recreation due to dangerous concentrations of these toxic, blue-green algae blooms, according to the Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE). Eight other sites are awaiting confirmation from a state lab about potential blooms in their water. Swimming, paddleboarding and wading are currently not allowed near the marina and West Shades area of Cherry Creek Reservoir due to elevated levels of microcystin, an algal toxin, a spokeswoman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) said Sunday. Boating and fishing were still allowed. Recreation is also currently prohibited at Barr Lake, Dewesee and Road Canyon reservoirs, data from the CDPHE shows . Reservoirs across the state, including Jumbo, North Sterling, Jackson, Stagecoach, Beaver Creek, La Jara, and Vega were among the sites with a potential bloom reported, according to the CDPHE. Blue Haron Lake was the only lake as of Tuesday that was also awaiting test results for algal toxins. If you'd like to check for algae bloom concentrations at any of these sites for yourself, click here and select the ""Recent conditions"" tab. Colorado Department of Health and Environment (CDPHE) The map above shows recent toxic algae conditions for select water bodies in the state. At Vega Reservoir, in Colorado’s Western Slope, visitors were encouraged to avoid any activities in the water where algae was visible, and to be especially mindful when walking pets near the reservoir and not let them drink the water or lick/ingest dried scum along the shoreline, as the blue-green algae can be toxic to pets. “If accidental exposure does occur, do not let your pet lick their fur or paws. Rinse them thoroughly with potable water and wear gloves for your own protection if possible,” CPW officials said. Coloradans will be able to tell if an algal bloom is harmful if it meets the following criteria, according to state health officials: Resembles thick pea soup or spilled paint on the water. Looks discolored — generally green, red, gold, or turquoise but typically not stringy or mustard yellow (the latter is probably pollen). Has foam, scum, or algae mats. Toxic algae is closing some Colorado bodies of water. Is this normal? What to do you if you or your pet comes into contact with blue-green algae Algae are an important part of aquatic food webs, but some types of blue-green algae (also called cyanobacteria) are capable of producing toxins that may cause negative health impacts for humans and pets at elevated concentrations, CPW officials said. If your dog gets into a harmful bloom, health officials advise that you rinse your pet off immediately with fresh, clean water. If you, a friend or a family member come contact with the bloom, immediately wash with soap and water. If your pet has been poisoned by the algae, it’ll show symptoms anywhere from 15 minutes to several days, including diarrhea or vomiting, weakness or staggering, drooling, difficulty breathing and convulsions or seizures, according to health officials. If your pets are exposed to the water and experience those symptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately, as these toxic algae can kill your pet. Humans poisoned by the algae could develop a skin irritation, diarrhea, stomach pain, fever, headache, and a sore throat. Exposure to these toxins can also harm a person’s liver and kidneys and affect their neurological systems, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . How you can play your part to mitigate toxic algae blooms While algal blooms are common in the summer when water temperatures rise, there are some things you can do to not make them worse, state health officials say. Picking up after your pet and properly disposing of their waste prevents nutrients found in excrement (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) from entering waterways, which contribute to algae blooms. Refraining from using too much fertilizer is also one way in which algal blooms can be kept at bay. If using de-icers, make sure they don’t contain urea (this information will be on the de-icer bag), health officials said. To learn more about blue-green algae, head to the CDPHE’s website .

This is in response to a site visit and water sample taken by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on 10/30/2023. The public should exercise caution in and around Lake Drawdy – S Shore. Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to begin doing so remains poorly understood. For this reason, it is important to exercise caution, as bloom conditions are dynamic and could change at any time. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) collects algae samples from reported bloom locations for toxin analysis. Once completed, the results will be posted on the FDEP Algal Bloom Dashboard , and can also be viewed on the Protecting Florida Together website, where you can sign up to be notified of the latest conditions. Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: We do not recommend that you swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Avoid getting water in your eyes, nose, or mouth. You should keep pets and livestock away from the waters in this location. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is safe. Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish well. You should not eat shellfish from this location. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals.

This is in response to a water sample taken by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection on February 7, 2024. The public should exercise caution in and around Cypress Lake – West Lobe. Blooms have the potential to produce toxins, and what triggers them to begin doing so remains poorly understood. For this reason, it is important to exercise caution, as bloom conditions are dynamic and could change at any time. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) collects algae samples from reported bloom locations for toxin analysis. Once completed, the results will be posted on the FDEP Algal Bloom Dashboard , and can also be viewed on the Protecting Florida Together website, where you can sign up to be notified of the latest conditions. Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: We do not recommend that you swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Avoid getting water in your eyes, nose, or mouth. You should keep pets and livestock away from the waters in this location. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is safe. Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish to appropriate temperature. You should not eat shellfish from this location. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals.

Protecting Florida Together is the state’s joint effort to provide statewide water quality information to prioritize environmental transparency and commitment to action . What do I do if I see an algal bloom? The Florida Department of Environmental Protection collects and analyzes algal bloom samples. To report a bloom to FDEP, call the toll-free hotline at 855-305-3903 or report online . To report fish kills, contact the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute at 1-800-636-0511. Report symptoms from exposure to a harmful algal bloom or any aquatic toxin to the Florida Poison Information Center, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak to a poison specialist immediately. Contact your veterinarian if you believe your pet has become ill after consuming or having contact with blue-green algae contaminated water.

By gisele galoustian | 3/18/2024 Florida Atlantic University researchers are asking residents of Cape Coral and surrounding communities to consider participating in a study to help evaluate the potential impacts of exposure to harmful algal blooms (HABs). Southwest Florida has experienced HABs such as red tide ( karenia brevis ) in prior years, which is most abundant during the summer and early fall months. Researchers will recruit volunteers on Tuesday, March 26, from noon to 4:30 p.m., and Wednesday, March 27, from 8 a.m. to noon, at the Public Works Department, 815 Nicholas Parkway East, Cape Coral. Appointments are available and walk-ins are welcome. Study participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire and provide urine and blood samples as well as a nasal swab. Human exposure to HABs comes from ingestion, direct skin contact or inhalation, and can lead to a variety of symptoms ranging from respiratory irritation to skin rashes and in severe cases liver damage.  Despite numerous occurrences of red tide and blue green algae in Florida waters, our understanding of the long-term health effects of exposure to these blooms remains limited. With grant funding from the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), researchers from FAU’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing and Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute are continuing this first-of-its-kind evaluation of both the short-term and potential long-term health effects among Florida residents. The “Long-term Effects of Exposure to Harmful Algal Blooms” (LEE-HABs) study uses a collaborative, multisite approach which also includes researchers from Florida Gulf Coast University. This latest study expands upon prior studies conducted in 2016 and 2018, and previous FDOH studies from 2019 to 2020 and 2021 to 2022. “We have little data on health outcomes related to human exposure, despite the prevalence and intensity of harmful algal blooms in Southwest Florida,” said Rebecca S. Koszalinski , Ph.D., principal investigator and an associate professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. “Understanding short- and long-term health impacts and outcomes is crucial to protecting the health of Floridians. By developing tools to measure concentrations of harmful algal blooms toxins in the environment and multiple human tissues, we will gain a better understanding of health-related outcomes and health care needs in Florida and elsewhere.” The study also is the first to evaluate the potential effect of exposure to COVID-19. Researchers are exploring if there is a relationship between a history of being infected with COVID-19 and susceptibility to the effects of harmful algal blooms exposure. The latest study involves a survey to identify the potential routes, duration and types of exposure to blooms through recreational and occupational activities. Researchers also will assess potential effects on individuals with pre-existing conditions such as asthma and chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Bloodwork including liver enzymes and renal markers also will be included in this study. Algal toxin concentrations including microcystin and brevotoxin will be measured in blood, urine and nasal mucosa. The toxin levels also will be used to understand the dose-response relationships with self-reported respiratory, dermal and gastrointestinal symptoms. Urine and blood analyses will be conducted in collaboration with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is developing methodology to detect emerging algal toxins in human tissues. The study includes conducting environmental sampling of water and air to measure potential sources of exposure. Researchers have developed a bio-repository and participant registry to store the data and samples in collaboration with FAU’s Clinical Research Unit within the FAU Division of Research . The purpose is to build an ongoing infrastructure to support the team’s long-term studies on the health effects of exposure to current and emerging harmful algal blooms toxins and serve as a resource for researchers around the state. Malcolm McFarland, Ph.D., a research associate at FAU Harbor Branch, is co-principal investigator of the study. The research team also includes Michael Parsons, Ph.D., co-investigator and a professor of marine science at Florida Gulf Coast University. For more information or to participate in the study, call or text 561-297-4631, or email Rebecca Koszalinski, Ph.D., at NurHAB@health.fau.edu . Community participants will receive up to $25 in gift cards as an incentive for participating in data collection activities each year. -FAU- Tags: research | harbor branch | faculty and staff | nursing Categories Academic / Campus Life Research Student Life Arts & Culture University Initiatives Apply Now Give to FAU Privacy Policy Regulations & Policies Consumer Information Employment Opportunities Get Help Report a Concern Site Index Accessibility Public Records Contact us Florida Atlantic University 777 Glades Road Boca Raton, FL 33431 Campuses: Boca Raton Dania Beach Davie Fort Lauderdale Harbor Branch Jupiter Facebook Twitter Pinterest Instagram Youtube Florida Atlantic University embodies a culture of strategic and collaborative community engagement that results in mutual benefit to the institution and the diverse internal and external communities that it serves. 2024 Florida Atlantic University ©",18 Mar 2024 07:00:00

Cayuga Lake (Spectrum News 1 photo) Independent monitor: Algal blooms in New York are getting worse By Susan Arbetter New York State PUBLISHED 7:34 PM ET Sep. 20, 2023 PUBLISHED 7:34 PM EDT Sep. 20, 2023 SHARE Something is wrong with Cayuga Lake. Harmful Algal Blooms, or HABs, have been widespread there. While New York state is supposed to be doing assessments and comprehensive watershed cleanup of the blooms, it hasnât been, according to Walter Hang, president of Toxics Targeting, an independent environmental monitor. According to Hangâs just released data, which he obtained from the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation, while Cayuga Lake has more reported HABs than any other waterbody in the state, these blooms threaten critical drinking water sources for more than 10 million New Yorkers. âThere are 186 HABs so far this year in New York state,â Hang told Capital Tonight. Hangâs research indicates that water supply sources with HABs include: Cannonsville Reservoir (NYC/Delware Co.) Owasco Lake (Auburn/Cayuga Co.) Cayuga Lake (Cayuga, Seneca, Tompkins Co.) Skaneateles Lake (Syracuse and Skaneateles/Onondaga, Cayuga, Cortland Co.) Hemlock Lake (Rochester/Livingston, Ontario Co.) Basic Creek Reservoir (Albany/Albany Co.) Amawalk Reservoir (NYC/Westchester Co.) Bog Brook Reservoir (NYC/Putnam Co.) DeRuyter Reservoir (Madison, Onondaga Co.) Jamesville Reservoir (Onondaga Co.) as well as Lake George, Lake Ontario and Lake Champlain. HABs are caused when too much phosphorus enters a waterbody. âThe problem is that during warm weather months, if you have too much phosphorus pollution in rivers, lakes, bays, you get these blooms. Imagine pea soup for as far as the eye can see,â Hang said. When the HABs die, they release highly neurotoxic mycrocystins which can kill dogs; humans are sensitive to them as well. The federal health advisory guideline for mycrocystins is .30 parts per billion. âItâs my understanding that yesterday [the city of Auburn] had a 1.6 ppb [of mycrocystins] in the raw water of Owasco Lake. So it hasnât made it into the finished water that they distribute to 45,000 people,â Hang said. âBut this shows you how perilously close they are to exceeding that health guideline.â Hang has written a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul urging her to âfundamentally revise the HABs clean-up programâ, which he says has failed to halt HABs. Hangâs HABs map, HABs list and the New York HABs Clean Up Campaign Coalition's letter to Hochul are posted here. The New York state Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York state Department of Health share responsibility for combatting HABs. The DEC sent the following emailed statement to Capital Tonight in response to Walter Hangâs allegations: âIt is a fact that DEC leads the most comprehensive HABs monitoring and reporting program in the nation. Safeguarding New York'sâ¯water qualityâ¯continues to be a top State priority and DEC is providing direct assistance to communities to effectivelyâ¯respond toâ¯Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs).â The statement continued. âThe DEC and the New York State Department of Health (DOH) are leading a multi-agency, statewide initiative to aggressively combat HABs and protect drinking water quality and the economy. DEC and DOH scientists and other experts are working closely with state and local partners to increase public awareness , investigate the causes of HABs across New York, and pioneer cutting-edge solutions to respond to these blooms and the threats they pose to public health and the environment. New York State has invested more than $371 million to support projects specifically targeting the reduction of HABs. DEC also launched resources such as the online HABs map and reporting system , which is updated daily during HABs season to ensure timely public notification and is effectively the exact same map discussed on the show today, and continues to be a national leader in supporting initiatives to address HABs across the state.â Spectrum News Contact About RSS Sitemap FAQ ADVERTISE WITH US CAREERS TERMS Your Privacy Rights California Consumer Privacy Rights California Consumer Limit the Use of My Sensitive Personal Information Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information/Opt-Out of Targeted Advertising CERTIFICATIONS Â© 2024, Charter Communications, all rights reserved.",20 Sep 2023 07:00:00

Robert Allstead fishes on the American River. (Spectrum News/Jamie Kennedy) Toxic algal blooms in California rivers were seen a lot less this summer By Jamie Kennedy Sacramento PUBLISHED 7:15 AM PT Oct. 31, 2023 PUBLISHED 7:15 AM PDT Oct. 31, 2023 SHARE SACRAMENTO, Calif. â As a beginner fisherman, Robert Allstead says he took up the sport partly because many around him kept telling him about their amazing fish stories. âI didnât have any to tell,â Allstead said. âIâve got a couple now.â What You Need To Know Chronic algal blooms inland and along the coast are seen as a rising problem due to global warming Blooms can kill aquatic wildlife and are harmful to humans and dogs California inland waterways saw fewer algal blooms in the summer of 2023 according to the state water resources board The record snow pack received earlier in the year is considered the primary driver of fewer blooms Another reason Allstead said he loves throwing out a line is being outdoors. âIf I donât have nothing to do. Iâm not going to sit at home,â he said. âIâd rather be on the river.â Allstead added that the fishing has been pretty good along with water conditions this summer. Conditions for fish and people in the rivers have been favorable this year. Over the past years, river systems around the state have been plagued by toxic algal blooms. But this year is different. Spencer Fern, Delta science program manager for the Restore the Delta nonprofit in the Stockton area, explained that last summer, McLeod Lake in the heart of Stockton â which feeds from the San Joaquin River â experienced algal blooms for much of the summer. âThis year, at least compared to last year and the years prior, we havenât seen any single harmful algal bloom outbreak along this waterway, which is kind of strange.â Fern noted that all along the San Joaquin River this summer, they saw a significant decrease in algal blooms. He said water conditions this year were relatively the same as previous years, except for one major difference. âThe increased water flow has come down as a result of [the huge] snowpack [working its way] throughout the system,â Fern said. Related Stories Researchers cut crop fertilizer, saving billions and planet Sustainably grown shellfish at Carlsbad Aquafarm Electric cranes will help clean up air around San Diego Fire, other ravages jeopardize Californiaâs prized forests The record snowpack is the same reason authorities released salmon fingerlings into the lower American River in Sacramento for the first time in years. The state water resources department reported across the state there has been a decrease in algal blooms in inland waterways. With the El Nino weather pattern, forecasters say we could be in for a wet winter but are unsure on the snowpack. Itâs something Allstead said he hopes for so he can once again wet a line and enjoy the river. âItâs calm, nobody bothering you,â Allstead said. And so, Allstead said he can finally land a big one â and tell his own fish tales.

A bloom of blue-green algae once again covered parts of the lake in September 2023. Located in Manitoba, Canada, the long lake has a watershed that spans one million square kilometers (386,000 square miles), draining some of Canada’s agricultural land. The lake consists of a large, deep north basin and a smaller, comparatively shallow south basin. Swirls of algae filled the south basin of the lake on September 25, 2023, when the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) on Landsat 9 acquired this image. Around this time, satellite observations analyzed by Environment and Climate Change Canada indicated that algae covered about 8,400 square kilometers (3,200 square miles), or about a third of the lake’s area. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are single-celled organisms that rely on photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. The bacteria grow swiftly when nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen are abundant in still water. The bloom pictured here may contain blue-green algae, as well as other types of phytoplankton; only a surface sample can confirm the exact composition of a bloom. Some cyanobacteria produce microcystin —a potent toxin that can irritate the skin and cause liver and kidney damage. While algae are part of a natural freshwater ecosystem, excess algae, particularly cyanobacteria, can be a nuisance to residents and tourists using the lake and its beaches for fishing, swimming, and recreation. Beaches in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg can get as many as 30,000 visitors a day during the summer months. Water samples taken at Winnipeg Beach on the west shore found that cyanobacteria levels were elevated in August , and visitors were advised to avoid swimming and fishing if green scum was visible. The health of Lake Winnipeg has been in decline in recent decades. Between 1990 and 2000, phosphorous concentrations in the lake almost doubled and algae blooms proliferated, both in terms of occurrence and extent. The major contributors to the influx of phosphorous to the lake were increased agricultural activities in the watershed and a higher frequency of flooding, which has increased runoff into the lake. Phosphorus concentrations are almost three times higher in the south basin of Lake Winnipeg, compared to the north basin. A 2019 study using data from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite found that the chlorophyll-a concentrations, which are used as a measure of phytoplankton biomass, were on average more than twice as high in the south basin, compared to the north.
