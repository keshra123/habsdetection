Here we show that phosphoketolase in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 ( Se XPK) possesses a distinct ATP-sensing mechanism, where a drop in ATP level allows Se XPK to divert precursors of the RuBisCO substrate away from the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. Deleting the Se XPK gene increased CO 2 fixation particularly during light–dark transitions. In high-density cultures, the Δxpk strain showed a 60% increase in carbon fixation and unexpectedly resulted in sucrose secretion without any pathway engineering. Using cryo-EM analysis, we discovered that these functions were enabled by a unique allosteric regulatory site involving two subunits jointly binding two ATP, which constantly suppresses the activity of Se XPK until the ATP level drops. This magnesium-independent ATP allosteric site is present in many species across all three domains of life, where it may also play important regulatory functions.

PCC 6803 Article Open access 16 December 2020 Main Terrestrial phototrophic organisms draw down about 120 Gt of carbon from atmosphere annually primarily through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle 1 . Similar figures have been estimated for marine organisms. This flux is about ten-times higher than that emitted by anthropogenic release of CO 2 2 , 3 Thus, an increase in the biological carbon fixation by even a few percent would greatly influence the carbon balance on earth. Cyanobacteria utilize solar energy to split water and produce NADPH and ATP via photosystems and the electron transport chain to support carbon fixation via the CBB cycle 4 . The CBB cycle accounts for the vast majority of carbon fixation on earth 5 , 6 , 7 , in which RuBisCO is the major enzyme catalyzing conversion of CO 2 and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Subsequent steps require ATP and NADPH to reduce 3PG to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) as precursors for glycogen synthesis or to regenerate RuBP to continue the CBB cycle (Fig. 1a ). The regulation of CBB cycle involves multiple factors and mechanisms, including light, redox potential and circadian regulation 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . As a marine organism, cyanobacteria frequently experience underwater light fluctuation and encounter environmental stress. The cell has to shut down CO 2 fixation rapidly in low-ATP conditions to avoid futile cycling resulting from simultaneous CO 2 fixation and respiration. Although all ATP-dependent reactions proceed slower at low ATP levels, it is desirable to stop the CBB cycle preferentially and immediately to prevent non-productive resource draining; however, such a mechanism has not been discovered. On the other hand, if this mechanism can be exploited, carbon fixation in cyanobacteria could be increased. Fig. 1: Effects of ATP on the activity of Se XPK. a , Proposed roles of Se XPK in response to ATP levels. When ATP levels are high during photosynthesis, Se XPK is inactive. When ATP levels are low, Se XPK would break down CBB cycle intermediates, including Xu5P, F6P and S7P, to stop carbon fixation. b , Plots of the initial activity of Se XPK against different concentrations of F6P in the presence of 0, 0.5 or 1 mM ATP and saturating 30 mM phosphate ( n = 3 individual reactions, mean ± s.e.m.). c , Enlarged plot from b , in the region of F6P below 20 mM. Source data Full size image Phosphoketolase (XPK) belongs to the transketolase family, a member of thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP)-dependent enzyme superfamily 12 , 13 . It converts F6P, xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P) or sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), which are intermediates in RuBP regeneration, to produce acetyl phosphate (AcP) and C3, C4 or C5 sugar phosphates (Fig. 1a ). XPK is also a key enzyme in the synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis 14 , 15 and has been exploited for engineering metabolism 16 , 17 ; however, its physiological role in cyanobacteria is not fully understood. A previous report 18 suggested that XPK in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. is responsible for utilization of xylose or glucose under heterotrophic conditions. We have shown 19 that the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 XPK ( Se XPK) is inhibited by ATP and participates in ATP production through the XPK–acetate kinase (ACK) pathway for long-term survival under anaerobic, dark and osmotic stress conditions. While deleting Se XPK did not affect growth under constant light or a 12 h/12 h light/dark (12-h L/D) cycle under aerobic conditions 19 , overexpression of Se XPK caused lethality. The role of XPK in carbon metabolisms and its ATP inhibitory mechanism are still puzzling in cyanobacteria under phototrophic growth conditions. In the CBB pathway, allosteric AMP inhibition of fructose-1,6/sedohaptulose-1.7-bisphosphatase has been reported in Synechocystis 6803 (ref. 20 ). In glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (Pyk) from Synechococcus PCC 6301 is inhibited by ATP 21 . Moreover, a CO 2 fixing enzyme PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in Synechocystis is regulated by Pll sensor-transducer, which is allosterically modulated by adenyl nucleotides 22 . In the absence of Pll, PEPC is inhibited by ATP. The above studies elucidated the importance of allosteric enzyme regulations by adenyl nucleotides in metabolic pathways. Considering that Se XPK is inhibited by ATP 19 , we propose that XPK may play a heretofore unrecognized role in dynamic metabolic regulation by diverting the RuBisCO substrate precursors away from the CBB cycle when ATP is low (Fig. 1a ) to avoid futile cycling. If so, its function would be most pronounced under low-ATP conditions, such as during light fluctuations, and the molecular mechanism of ATP sensing by XPK would provide a useful insight. Furthermore, if XPK serves as a metabolic ‘brake’ for the CBB cycle, it could be deleted or inhibited to increase CO 2 fixation, thereby increasing the net carbon draw down by cyanobacteria and even producing useful compounds. Results Se XPK functions as a CBB brake upon ATP drop We first performed steady-state kinetic analysis, which suggested that Se XPK is inhibited in vitro by ATP through an allosteric mode (Fig. 1b,c ), similar to Cryptococcus neoformans XPK reported previously 23 . On the other hand, Bifidobacterium longum XPK showed no inhibition by ATP (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Based on the kinetic data, the activity of Se XPK should be constantly inhibited when the intracellular ATP concentration is about 1 mM or greater; however, immediately after transition from light to darkness, ATP drops to 0.4 mM (Fig. 2 ), which should relieve the inhibition of Se XPK. Fig. 2: Delayed cessation of CO 2 incorporation by Δxpk after light-to-dark switch. a , Three WT and the three Δxpk cultures were grown in BG11 medium containing 50 mM NaHCO 3 under 12-h L/D cycles until the OD 730 reached 1 (top). Then, during hours 5–6 in the light period, both cultures were refreshed with BG11 then supplied with 2 mM NaH 14 CO 3 , as time 0, under 50 μmol m −2 s −1 light. The light was switched off 10 min later. The 14 C incorporation was analyzed for samples collected at 5, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 20 min. The 14 C incorporation % ( y axis) was calculated by 14 C cell / ( 14 C cell + 14 C medium ) ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). Under the same experimental conditions as above, WT and Δxpk cultures were supplied with 2 mM unlabeled NaHCO 3 (bottom). Equal volumes of culture samples from each time point were collected and the ATP concentration was determined by a luminescence-based assay, as described in Methods ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). b , WT and Δxpk cultures were grown under 10-min L/D cycles then supplied with 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 at the end of the night, as time 0. c , Same as b , except for growing under 250-min L/D cycles. Source data Full size image To investigate the role of XPK under the low-ATP conditions, we measured the carbon incorporation by the wild-type (WT) and XPK deletion ( Δxpk ) strains during the transition from light to dark. We grew these strains under 12-h L/D cycles until the optical density at 730 nm (OD 730 ) reached 1. In the middle of the light period, NaH 14 CO 3 was added to the cultures and carbon incorporation and intracellular ATP concentration were measured before and after switching to darkness. Results show that the carbon incorporation was similar between the WT and Δxpk strains in the presence of light (Fig. 2a ); however, upon abrupt switching from light to dark, the carbon incorporation by the WT strain began to decrease, coinciding with the ATP drop. The net carbon incorporation continued to decrease, presumably due to carbon release in the dark period, whereas the intracellular ATP concentration recovered due to respiration. In contrast, the Δxpk strain continued incorporating CO 2 for about 5 min in darkness, suggesting that the cell in the absence of Se XPK was not able to stop CBB activity immediately upon abrupt switching from light to dark. To further validate this result, we evaluated carbon incorporation of the WT and Δxpk strains in two continuous L/D cycles at different frequencies, 10 min/10 min or 250 min/250 min L/D periods (Fig. 2b,c ). In both cases, the carbon incorporation by the WT and the Δxpk strains were equal during the light phase. When entering the dark phase, the carbon incorporation was immediately reduced in the WT strain, but continued to increase in the Δxpk strain for several minutes, again coinciding with the ATP drop (Fig. 2b–d ). The continued carbon uptake by the Δxpk strain in dark indicates the lack of CBB brake provided by XPK. On the other hand, the ATP level was not affected by the XPK deletion, suggesting that XPK’s primary role is the regulation of CBB cycle activity in response to the ATP level, but not the regulation of ATP level itself. Although XPK produces AcP, which leads to acetate and ATP production, the ATP production efficiency by respiration is much higher and dwarfs the contribution of XPK. The CBB regulation by XPK is distinct from the well-known post-translational oscillator KaiABC, which controls various processes, including CBB cycle genes 8 , 24 . The regulation by XPK also complements a thioredoxin-modulated protein CP12, which forms an inactive ternary complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase (PRK) to reduce carbon fixation in dark or oxidative conditions 11 . Deletion of CP12 in S. elongatus PCC7942 retards growth and reduces O 2 consumption through respiration at night 25 . In contrast, Se XPK reduces carbon fixation by sensing a sudden drop of the ATP level (Fig. 2 ), but its deletion does not affect growth under normal conditions 19 or influence O 2 evolution in light and consumption in dark (Supplementary Table 2 ). Se XPK removes RuBisCO substrate precursors when ATP is low To further investigate the function of Se XPK, we measured the levels of 13 C-incorporated metabolites in the WT and Δxpk strains upon the light to dark switch for the three conditions in Fig. 2 . NaH 13 CO 3 was added immediately before light to dark switching and the levels of 13 C-incorporated metabolites were measured. Results showed that 13 C-labeled glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) were higher in the Δxpk strain relative to the WT in all three L/D conditions (Fig. 3a , with original data in Supplementary Fig. 1a ). The 13 C-labeled xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P)/ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) and sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P) levels were higher in the Δxpk strain under the interrupted light and 10-min L/D conditions. The levels of glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) were also higher for 10-min and 250-min L/D cycles, compared to the WT. In contrast, 13 C-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG), 2-phosphoglycerate (2PG) and acetyl-CoA (AcCoA) were slightly less or not changed in the Δxpk strain compared to WT (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 1b ). These data suggest that Se XPK in WT drained these precursors of the RuBisCO substrate to stop CO 2 fixation after switching to dark. Without such a brake in the Δxpk strain, the cell continued to fix carbon using the remaining ATP and NADPH, while starting the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative pentose pathway and respiration to generate ATP and reducing power. Simultaneously fixing CO 2 and producing CO 2 can form a futile cycle with a net drain of ATP, which can adversely affect cell physiology in general. Fig. 3: The increases of 13 C-labeled RuBisCO substrate precursors in Δxpk after transition to darkness. Three WT and the three Δxpk cell cultures were grown under constant light (top) or different L/D conditions (middle and bottom) until OD 730 reached 1. Equal amount of NaH 13 CO 3 was added to the WT and Δxpk cultures in the middle of the light as 0 min (arrow) immediately before the light was turned off (black bar). a , XPK substrates (F6P, Xu5P and S7P) are RuBisCO substrate precursors.

G3P is a catalyzed product by XPK. 3PG, 2PG and AcCoA are intermediates and products in glycolysis. The 13 C-labeled % was analyzed as the % of 13 C / 12 C. The 13 C-labeled and unlabeled 12 C-metabolites were analyzed by multiple reaction monitoring using LC–MS/MS, as described in Methods . The sum of the peak area from the 13 C-labeled metabolite ( 13 C) was divided by the total peak area consisting of the area from the unlabeled 12 C metabolite ( 12 C) and the sum area from labeled 13 C. n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.

Source data Full size image Deletion of Se XPK increases net carbon fixation and enables sucrose production in high-density cultures In addition to L/D switching, we looked for other conditions that may reduce intracellular ATP levels. We found that the ATP level decreased when the cell density increased in a shaking culture (Fig. 4a ), presumably due to self-shading 26 and high-frequency light fluctuation. We then measured the 14 C incorporation by the cells at different cell densities during the light phase in the 12-h L/D cycle. Notably, we found that the Δxpk strain incorporated more CO 2 than WT even during the light phase as the cell density increased from 2 to 5 at OD 730 (Fig. 4b–d ). At OD 730 = 5, the Δxpk strain fixed 63% more carbon than the WT strain (Fig. 4d ), based on their slopes within 30 min. Thus, Se XPK in the WT strain can reduce carbon fixation by sensing low levels of ATP under self-shaded, light-fluctuating conditions. Fig. 4: High-density culture of the Δxpk strain enhanced net carbon fixation resulting in sucrose secretion at night. a , Cellular ATP levels decreased at high cell density. Three WT and the three Δxpk cultures were grown under 12-h L/D cycles. Light intensity was 50 μmol m −2 s −1 .

Equal amounts from each culture were collected at the end of light (white) and at the end of dark (gray) and the remaining bicarbonate was converted to CO 2 and measured. The net carbon fixation in the WT and in the Δxpk was 1 g l −1 and 1.6 g l −1 , respectively after 4 d. f , 13 CO 2 was released from the WT and the Δxpk cultures into medium in dark. The cultures were fed with 100 mM NaH 13 CO 3 for 2 d in 12-h L/D cycles then refreshed with BG11 before transition to dark. The carbon release at 60 min was set as 1 and the relative value at each time point is presented. g , Δxpk synthesized sucrose in the light and secreted sucrose in the dark.

( a – h ). Source data Full size image Then we assessed the net carbon fixation of long-term, high-density WT and Δxpk cultures in a 12-h L/D cycles with the cell density from 4–7 at OD 730 . The Δxpk culture again showed increased bicarbonate consumption compared to the WT culture in the light periods. In the dark periods, approximately half of the pre-fixed carbon was released via respiration. At the end of the 4-d culture, the WT and Δxpk cultures respectively consumed 1 g l −1 and 1.6 g l −1 of carbon of bicarbonate and dissolved CO 2 (Fig. 4e ). To investigate the effect of Se XPK deletion on the respiratory carbon release, we grew the WT and Δxpk cultures with NaH 13 CO 3 for 2 d to label the cellular components with 13 C, then washed away the residual NaH 13 CO 3 in the medium and measured 13 CO 2 release from both cultures in darkness. The result (Fig. 4f ) showed that the WT and Δxpk cultures released equal amounts of the pre-fixed 13 C after switching to darkness, suggesting that deletion of Se XPK did not affect respiration. Hence, Se XPK functions as a CBB brake but is not involved in carbon release during dark respiration. To determine the distribution of the fixed carbons, we measured the amounts of biomass and sugar contents of the WT and Δxpk strains during the 4-d culture (Fig. 4g,h and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). Notably, the increased carbon fixation by the Δxpk strain mostly resulted in sucrose secretion, which was synthesized during the light phase and excreted in the dark phase (Fig. 4g ). At the end of 4 d, 1.3 g l −1 of sucrose was excreted from the Δxpk culture, which is tenfold higher than that from the WT culture. The amount of biomass and protein showed no difference between the two cultures (Extended Data Fig. 2b,d ), whereas more sucrose but less glycogen was detected in the Δxpk culture (Fig. 4h and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). To determine whether the deletion of Se XPK caused any global gene expression change, we measured transcriptome profiles from the WT and Δxpk cultures with cell density of 2 at OD 730 , under 12-h L/D conditions. Our RNA-seq data showed only minor global transcriptome differences between WT and Δxpk (Extended Data Fig. 3a,b ). In particular, the expression level of the cation efflux protein was lower in the Δxpk strain compared to the WT; however, its function is not yet characterized. Additionally, a few membrane-associated proteins were also downregulated in the Δxpk strain. Deletion of Se XPK did not alter the expression levels of carbon metabolic genes under the conditions examined. This result implied that Se XPK influences carbon fixation primarily at the metabolite level. Se XPK facilitates survival under high-frequency L/D cycles As the function of Se XPK was observed mainly during the L/D transitions, we evaluated whether Se XPK would have an impact on growth under different frequencies of L/D cycles. The diurnal (12-h L/D cycle) growth curves of the WT and Δxpk strains were very similar (Supplementary Fig. 2 ), in agreement with previous results 19 . Then we dotted equal amount of WT and Δxpk cells on BG11 agar plates and observed their growth at different frequencies of L/D cycle from 1 cycle per day (12-h L/D) to 360 cycles per day (2-min L/D). Imaging and autofluorescence measurements of the growing cell dots revealed that high-frequency L/D cycles reduced the growth rates of both the WT and Δxpk strains, but substantially more so for the latter (Fig. 5 ). These results suggest that XPK facilitates cyanobacteria survival in rapid L/D transitions. In control, no growth differences between the WT and Δxpk strains were observed under low-frequency L/D cycles. Thus, Se XPK’s function as a CBB cycle brake under low-ATP conditions is also important for cell survival in high-frequency L/D fluctuation. Fig. 5: Se XPK functions as a regulator in rapid light–dark cycles. a , WT and Δxpk cells were first grown under continuous light for 2–3 d. Aliquots of both cultures were adjusted with culture medium to equal cell density with OD 730 = 1. Both were subjected to tenfold serial dilutions (10 −1 , 10 −2 and 10 −3 ) and dotted on the BG11 medium containing agar plates for continuous growth under different frequencies of L/D cycles for 4 d. The 10 −3 dilution culture dots did not grow and thus are not shown. b , Autofluorescence ( y axis) of the dotted WT (black) and Δxpk (orange) cultures was monitored during the culture time (day, x axis). The fluorescence intensity for each cell dot from the 10 −1 dilution was plotted and the growth slopes per day were calculated from the linear phase day 2 to day 4 ( n = 4 biological repeats, ±s.e.m.). Source data Full size image Unique ATP-binding motif in XPK Given the importance of the physiological role of Se XPK, we solved the cryo-EM structures of Se XPK, both free (with coenzyme TPP/Mg 2+ bound) and complexed with the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog, AMPPNP. In contrast to the published XPK structures from Lactococcus lactis and B. breve/longum , which exist as dimers in crystals 27 , 28 , 29 , the cryo-EM structure of Se XPK is a dodecamer composed of six dimeric units, forming a circular donut-shaped array both for the AMPPNP-bound form (Fig. 6a , Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 3 ) and in the absence of AMPPNP (Extended Data Fig. 4a , Supplementary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table 3 ). The dimer is assembled face-to-face with two AMPPNP molecules residing head-to-head at the dimer interface in-between the C terminus of the subunits, approximately 30 Å away from the catalytic site of the respective subunit (Fig. 6b , with density maps in Extended Data Fig. 5a ). Comparison between the free and bound dimers in the same orientation (Fig. 6c,d ) shows that the two subunits jointly bind two AMPPNP. The key residues, H706 and Y710 from reciprocal subunits (helix α24 based on Supplementary Fig. 3 ), sandwich AMPPNP in the dimer interface by forming π–π stacking interactions with the adenine ring of AMPPNP. The α- and β-phosphate groups of AMPPNP are stabilized by H706, H719, R721 and R753 and the γ-phosphate group by R711 from the reciprocal subunit (Fig. 6e ). Furthermore, unlike most other ATP-binding sites, there is no Asp or Glu within 5 Å of AMPPNP and no detectable divalent metal ion binding to the PPNP moiety. Instead, the negative charges of PPNP are mainly stabilized by the positive charges of the adjacent Arg and His residues (Fig. 6e ).

Further explanation with a stereo views is provided in Extended Data Fig. 7 . Primed residues designate residues from the reciprocal subunit in the dimer. Full size image Even though H706 and Y710 on two different subunits are the key residues for ATP binding, they are also key residues for maintaining the integrity of the dimer interface (Fig. 6e ). Thus, H706A and Y710A lost most of their catalytic activities to nearly the limit of detection (Extended Data Fig. 1d,e ). As the corresponding residue of H706 is Arg in the non-ATP-inhibited XPK from B. adolescentis 19 and B. longum (Supplementary Fig. 3 ), we tested and confirmed that the XPK-H706R mutant was active but not inhibited by ATP (Extended Data Fig. 1f ). Another notable residue involved in the binding of ATP is R711, which forms a salt bridge with the γ-phosphate of ATP and explains the lack of inhibition by ADP (Extended Data Fig. 1g ). The results demonstrate the power of cryo-EM in enzymology 30 . For comparison, we also solved the cryo-EM structure of B. longum XPK and found it to be an octamer, resembling the recently reported structure with calcium instead of magnesium ions 31 (Extended Data Fig. 4b , Supplementary Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3 ). Of note, while the dimer–dimer interface in the Se XPK dodecamer involves residues near the C terminus, the B. longum XPK octamer involves residues near the N terminus. Comparison between the C-terminal interfaces of free Se XPK and free B. longum XPK structures provides a structural basis for the lack of ATP inhibition in B. longum XPK (Extended Data Fig. 6 ). As the donut-shape or four-leaf clover shape-like particles or two-dimensional (2D) class average images were not in perfect symmetry (Supplementary Figs. 4b , 5b and 6b ), we further examined whether the assigned symmetries were pseudosymmetry. As described in Methods and Supplementary Fig. 7 , some relative random motions were observed between different dimers in both Se XPK dodecamer and B. longum octamer assemblies, suggesting the likelihood of pseudosymmetry in these structures. Structure-based searches of the Protein Data Bank (PDB) 32 were performed to determine whether there is any similar ATP-binding mode in 5,933 protein structures complexed with ATP, ADP, AMP or analogs. The search criteria are defined in Extended Data Fig. 8a . The PDB structures meeting the requirement of the atomic distances are listed in Source Data File 1 (226 structures). Most of these structures, however, have both aromatic residues from the same polypeptide chain. Only three structures consist of two aromatic residues from different subunits of a dimer positioned nearby the adenine ring (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d ). For all of these, only one aromatic residue forms ring stacking with the adenine ring of the nucleotide and none has an additional Arg nearby. Therefore, no structure matches the full criteria, supporting the uniqueness of the ATP-binding mode. The root-mean-square deviation between the structures with and without AMPPNP-bound is very small: (0.42 Å from 7,897 Cα atoms of the dodecamer and 0.36 Å from 1,256 Cα atoms of the dimer). Nonetheless, ATP binding to the allosteric site could cause conformational change of active site residues through a pathway of local conformational changes involving three structurally observable steps, as summarized in Fig. 6f and detailed in Fig. 6g–n and Extended Data Fig. 5b–d , with further explanation by stereo views in Extended Data Fig. 7 showing important roles of P702–W703 in these conformational steps. In step 1, ATP binding affects side-chain conformations of residues in helix α24 as explained above (Fig. 6g–j ; in two different views). In step 2, the W703 side chain from both subunits wobble in two alternative positions and form an H-bond interaction with D551 from the same subunit or N555 from the other subunit; both are highly conserved residues from helix α19. Also, W703 forms a cation-pi interaction with K707 (Fig. 6i–l ). In step 3, these interactions lead to closer contact of the active site loop with the adjacent conserved catalytic residues such as Y492–N540 and K593–D538 interactions (Fig. 6m,n ), which could impede substrate binding. Presence of the ATP-regulatory motif in all three domains of life The above structural and functional analyses identified eight important residues (P702, W703, H706, Y710, R711, H719, R721 and R753) for the allosteric inhibition of Se XPK by ATP (Fig. 6e and Extended Data Fig. 7 ). These residues are conserved in other XPKs reported to be inhibited by ATP 19 , 23 , leading to a conserved motif PWX 2 H a X 3 Y’R’ a X 7 H b XR b X 31 R c , where a,b,c designate histidine or arginine at different positions and primed residues cross-interact with the reciprocal ATP molecule as illustrated in Fig. 7a . This representation is equivalent to Fig. 6e , where each ATP molecule interacts with residues from both unprimed and primed subunits. In support, the XPK variants not inhibited by ATP from this work and previous reports 19 , 33 are not conserved at these positions (Fig. 7b , rows 9–12). Fig. 7: Proposed ATP-regulatory motif and its occurrence in diverse microorganisms. a , Schematic illustration of how two conserved motifs (red and blue) jointly interact with two ATP molecules (red and blue, respectively). Primed residues cross-interact with the reciprocal ATP molecule. b , The conservation of the structurally characterized ATP-regulatory motif (labeled in red) among phosphoketolases that have been biochemically characterized to be inhibited (1–8) or uninhibited (9–12) by ATP 19 , 23 , 33 . c , Construction of a neighbor-joining tree for the 3,190 ATP-regulatory motif-containing protein sequences (with all eight motif residues identical, except that R a is allowed to be K also for fungus due to reported data in row 8). The NCBI accession nos. of all sequences are in Source Data File 2 . The subset of methanotroph is shown here and some other subsets are shown in Supplementary Fig. 9 . d , Comparison of sequence logos from randomly chosen 1,377 cyanobacterial sequences (NCBI taxid, 1117), 176 methanotroph sequences (NCBI taxid, 135618) and 1,194 fungus sequences (NCBI taxid, 33154) for the eight conserved residues in the ATP-regulatory motif along with their surrounding residues. The motif residues are shown in green, blue and orange colors, respectively. Residue numbering is based on Se XPK, Methylomonas sp. DH-1 and C. neoformans var. grubii H99, respectively. The logos were constructed by use of the WebLogo 3 web server 70 . Source data. Full size image Next, we investigated the prevalence of this motif by NCBI BLAST in a non-redundant protein database 34 . From the 4,930 phosphoketolase sequences with >60% sequence identity to the Se XPK, 3,175 sequences showed all eight residues identical (Fig. 7c and Source Data File 2 ). A subset of these sequences with ≥70% identity is shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 . These phosphoketolase sequences predominantly belong to cyanobacteria, proteobacteria and actinobacteria phyla. As expected, they include a number of aquatic cyanobacteria, including marine species such as Synechococcus , Oscillatoria , Anabaena , Okeania and Acaryochloris . Among the proteobacteria phylum, the major groups are phototrophic and methanotrophic bacteria, including Methylomonas sp., known for bioengineering applications 35 , 36 . The remaining sequences came from a wide variety of species, including sulfur-oxidizing autotrophic bacteria, acidobacteria, chemolithoautotrophic bacteria; human pathogens Spirochaetes , Parachlamydiaceae and Cryptococcus (fungi); plant pathogen Pestalotiopsis (fungi); and Euryarchaeota archaeon (Extended Data Fig. 9 and Source Data File 2 ). The actual number of species could be larger if conserved residues in addition to identical residues are included, such as replacing the R a residue with a lysine (Extended Data Fig. 9 ). To compare the relative abundance of the sequences containing the ATP-regulatory motif between different species, we then constructed sequence logos from sets of sequences without pre-selection for cyanobacteria, methanotroph and fungus, for the eight motif residues and their surrounding ones (Fig. 7d ). The results suggest that the regulatory motif is highly abundant in cyanobacteria and methanotroph and substantially less so in fungi. Further structural and functional analyses of other systems are highly warranted. Notably, the ATP-binding motif also exists in methanotrophs and methylotrophs, which do not have the CBB cycle but use the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle 37 to assimilate C1 compounds, including methane, methanol and formaldehyde. To test this motif prediction, we cloned a methylotrophic Methylomonas sp. XPK in E. coli and overexpressed and purified the protein. Indeed, its allosteric inhibition by ATP was validated based on steady-state kinetics (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i ). As RuMP and CBB cycles share many common enzymes and metabolites, including the XPK substrates Xu5P, F6P and S7P, it is conceivable that XPK also serves as a metabolic brake in response to the ATP level to regulate the RuMP cycle. Indeed, as methane and methanol in the environment are scarce and their supply may be intermittent, an XPK control of its assimilation based on its energy level may be of importance. Discussion XPK is an enzyme present in many microorganisms, primarily involved in substrate-level phosphorylation to produce AcP. Cyanobacterial XPK, however, evolved to acquire a unique mechanism to bind to ATP at the interface between two subunits through its N-terminal residues. The binding leads to a conformational change of active site residues to inhibit its activity. With this ATP-sensing activity, Se XPK stops carbon fixation when ATP levels are low, by diverting CBB cycle intermediates to AcP, which may proceed to produce acetate and ATP (Fig. 8 and Extended Data Fig. 10 ). Typically, low ATP levels occur at the transition between L/D periods. Alternatively, during high-frequency light fluctuation caused by self-shading or ocean vertical currents, ATP levels could also drop. Under these conditions, if both CBB cycle and respiration are functional, the simultaneous operation of both leads to a futile cycle with a net effect of draining ATP. Se XPK evolved to avoid this wasteful activity and represents a distinct mechanism to control carbon fixation through CBB. Thus, Se XPK facilitates cell survival under high-frequency light fluctuations. Fig. 8: XPK serves as a CBB cycle brake under low ATP conditions. Under normal ATP conditions (>1 mM), which occur at sufficient light or during dark periods when respiration is fully functional and CBB stops due to the lack of reducing power, XPK is inhibited and serves no function; however, during sudden environmental changes (for example self-shading and high-frequency light fluctuation), the ATP level drops and XPK is relieved from inhibition. XPK then diverts the CBB intermediate to stop CO 2 fixation and produces AcP, which is then converted to acetate and ATP. Full size image The regulatory role of Se XPK is not essential under constant light and 12-h L/D cycle conditions. Thus, deletion of Se XPK does not affect growth; however, in a high-cell-density culture with self-shading, deletion of Se XPK increased net carbon fixation, due to the lack of the CBB cycle brake. Notably, the increased carbon fixation flux primarily results in sucrose secretion. Thus, Se XPK interrupts carbon fixation and prevents sucrose excretion in response to low ATP; however, the link between Se XPK deletion and sucrose secretion remains unclear. Unlike introducing synthetic pathways or overexpressing CBB pathway genes that increase carbon fixation, deletion of XPK achieves these goals without additional gene modifications 38 , 39 , 40 . In contrast to most studies on enhancing photosynthetic carbon assimilation or reducing respiratory mechanisms, it is rare that deletion of a single gene elevates net carbon fixation toward sugar production 41 , 42 . The deletion of Se XPK can be combined with other metabolic engineering strategies to increase the production of sucrose or other products. Another example has been discovered in Synechocystis Δeda mutant whose 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate (KDPG) aldolase is lacked in the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. KDPG cannot be converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate but enhances CBB flux and glycogen formation 43 . Sucrose production in cyanobacteria is used as osmoprotective compound to balance the osmotic potential between cell interior and exterior 44 . Previously, by adding salt to a sucrose-secreting strain expressing cscB , a heterologous sucrose/proton symporter, in S. elongatus PCC7942, sucrose production was dramatically increased up to 0.9 g l −1 a day 45 . Additionally, overexpressing sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in S. elongatus UTEX2973 produced 1.1 g l −1 sucrose a day without salt stimulation 46 . The xpk deletion enables sucrose synthesis, probably due to its increase in the substrate levels for SPS (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 2 ). G1P is the precursor for UDP/ADP glucose formation, then SPS converts UDP/ADP glucose and F6P to sucrose phosphate. Subsequently, sucrose is formed via sucrose phosphate phosphatase. Of note, the Δxpk strain synthesized more sucrose but accumulated less glycogen in Δxpk (Fig. 4 and Extended Data Fig. 2c ). Unlike sucrose synthesis, which can proceed with UTP, glycogen synthesis requires ATP to form the glucan chain. In the WT strain, XPK functions as a CBB brake under low ATP levels. When ATP is again available, carbon fixation resumes immediately. In the Δxpk strain, carbon fixation via CBB continues even under low ATP levels and produces excess hexophosphates, which are then converted to sucrose and secreted. As CBB continues in the Δxpk strain, glycogen breaks down to G1P, followed by phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and ED pathway to replenish CBB intermediates 47 . This may explain the lower glycogen amount in the Δxpk strain (Extended Data Fig. 2c ). While glycogen and sucrose can both store energy in the cell, storage of sucrose increases osmotic stress. As a result, sucrose is secreted from the Δxpk strain. Hence, the role of XPK is to prevent two wasteful processes under low ATP conditions: futile cycling between carbon fixation and respiration and sucrose secretion. The secretion of sucrose by Δxpk in the dark without osmotic stress broadens the conditions from our previous results 19 . Cyanobacteria have capability for exporting compounds such as saccharides, acetate, lactate and toxic metabolites 48 . According to the membrane transporter database TransportDB2.0 (ref. 49 ), S. elongatus PCC7942 contains ten major facilitator superfamily protein transporters and some of them may participate in multidrug and sugar efflux. These may be responsible for sucrose secretion; however, further investigation is required to understand the mechanism involved in sugar secretion. Overall, these findings suggest that the ATP allosteric regulation of XPK, with a newly identified binding site that is widely present in nature, provides a sensitive metabolic brake to C1 carbon assimilation cycles in response to ATP shortage due to sudden environmental changes and is particularly important for marine cyanobacteria as the cells are constantly subject to intermittent supply of light. As the CBB cycle shares many steps with the RuMP cycle in methylotrophs, it is conceivable that the same ATP-sensing mechanism is used to control methane and methanol assimilation in these organisms (Extended Data Fig. 1h,i ). How this mechanism can be exploited to increase C1 assimilation presents an interesting topic for further studies. Methods Recombinant protein expression and purification S. elongatus PCC7942 XPK (Synpcc7942_2080) was constructed under a pDC vector harboring a lac promoter and its N terminus was in-framed with a 6His-tag for nickel column purification. H706R, H710A and Y710A S. elongatus mutants were generated via QuickChange II Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent). B. longum XPK (BIL_11880) and Methylomonas sp. DH-1 XPK (AMY39_18755) were also constructed by using the above plasmid. Se XPK, its mutant variants and B. longum XPK were individually transformed in E. coli DH5αDE3.1 strain. Recombinant XPK proteins were expressed by adding 1 mM IPTG in 5 l LB culture supplied with 250 µg ml −1 spectinomycin and incubated in 30 °C, 150 r.p.m., for 16–20 h. The purification procedure followed that of Suzuki et al. 50 with some modifications. The cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A, containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), 1 mM MgCl 2 and cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). The suspended cells were disrupted with a homogenizer (Avestin EmulsiFlex-C3), then centrifuged at 20,000 r.p.m., 4 °C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was applied to an open column stuffed with cOmplete His-Tag purification resin (Roche). The resin was equilibrated with buffer A before loaded with protein sample. The sample-loaded resin was subjected to washing steps with buffer A supplemented with 10 mM imidazole and increased concentration of NaCl (from 0.1 M, 0.4 M to 1 M NaCl). Before protein elution, the resin was further washed with buffer A to reduce the salt content and was subsequently washed with buffer A supplemented with 0.25 M imidazole to elute proteins. The eluted protein sample was concentrated and loaded into a 5-ml Q Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The protein sample was eluted with a NaCl gradient in buffer A supplemented with 1 M NaCl. The collected fraction sample was applied to a HiLoad 16/600 SuperdexTM 200 pg column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM TPP and 1 mM MgCl 2 . The eluted protein was examined with SDS–PAGE for purity as well its identity with mass spectrometry. Kinetic assay XPK enzymatic velocity was determined by measuring the formation of AcP using a colorimetric method 14 . The 50-µl enzymatic reaction solutions contained 30 mM sodium phosphate (pH 6.4), 1 mM TPP, 1 mM MgCl 2 and different concentrations of fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) or sodium phosphate (Pi). The reaction began by adding 8 µg of purified XPK. A total of 40 µl was taken from each reaction at serial time points (30 s to 2 h) and the reaction was stopped by adding 60 µl 2 M hydroxylamine (pH 6.5) in a 96-well plate. After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, the coloring reagents, including 40 µl 15% trichloroacetic acid, 40 µl 4 M HCl and 40 µl 3% FeCl 3 in 0.1 M HCl were added sequentially. Absorbance at 505 nm was then recorded on a plate reader. A standard curve using commercial lithium potassium AcP was used to relate absorbance to concentration, which showed a linear relationship between 0.3125 to 100 mM in the conditions described. The OD 505 values were converted to the product AcP in µmol and used to establish kinetic curves (Fig. 1 and Extended Data Fig. 1 ) and calculate the initial velocity (µmol AcP mg XPK −1 min −1 or simply µmol mg −1 min −1 ). V max and K m values were determined by varying the concentration of one substrate with another substrate held constant at a saturating level (30 mM Pi or 150 mM F6P) (Extended Data Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1 ). Cyanobacteria strains and growth condition Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 WT and the Δxpk strain 19 were respectively grown in 50 ml BG11 medium 51 , pH 8, supplemented with 50 mM NaHCO 3 , under a 12-h L/D cycle. The incubation conditions were 30 °C, light intensity 50 µmol m −2 s −1 and shaking speed at 150 r.p.m. Gentamycin (10 µg ml −1 ) was added to the Δxpk culture to ensure the growth of the xpk knockout genotype. The cell growth was monitored at an optical density of 730 nm (OD 730 ). The average dry-cell weight of 384 mg l −1 was calibrated for the culture with an OD 730 of 1 used for experimental calculation. 14 C incorporation experiment For the 14 C incorporation experiments (Fig. 2a ), WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicates for individual culture) were grown in the BG11 medium containing 50 mM NaHCO 3 , under a 12-h L/D cycle (light intensity, 50 µmol m −2 s −1 ; 30 °C; shaking speed, 150 r.p.m.). Then, after 5–6 h during the light period, the cultures were respectively refreshed with BG11. Then, 0.8 ml from individual culture (OD 730 = 1) was transferred to a 24-well Petri dish under light. The 14 C-labeling was initiated (time 0) by adding 0.2 ml 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 (containing 113 µCi of total 14 C) to the cultures. After 10 min, the light was switched off. Then, the cultures were collected at the time points (under darkness): 5, 10, 11, 13, 15 and 20 min and further subjected to the 14 C incorporation analyses 51 . Then, 40 µl of each labeled culture was transferred to Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters, spun at full speed for 10 s to separate cells from the medium. The cell pellet was immediately resuspended with 200 µl 0.1 M NaOH, then transferred to a scintillation vial. The cell-free medium (~40 µl) was supplemented with 160 µl BG11 and transferred to another vial. The Ultima Gold scintillation cocktail (5 ml) was then added to each vial for liquid scintillation counting analyses. The 14 C incorporation % ( y axis) was calculated by 14 C cell / ( 14 C cell + 14 C medium ) × 100 ( n = 3, mean ± s.e.m.). For the experiments shown in Fig. 2b,c , the WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches) were grown under a 10-min L/D cycle or 250-min L/D cycle. The cultures were refreshed with BG11 and adjusted to the cell density (OD 730 = 1) in the dark. Then, 0.8 ml starting culture (OD 730 = 1) was added with 0.2 ml 50 mM NaH 14 CO 3 upon switching to light (set as time 0 min). The following samples were collected at different time points from two continuous L/D cycles. To analyze the 14 C incorporation at the high cell density, (Fig. 4b–d ), the WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches) were grown under a 12-h L/D cycle until the OD 730 reached to 1 or 2. The cultures were refreshed with BG11 and adjusted OD 730 to 1, 2 or 5. After 5–6 h illumination, an 0.8-ml culture (OD 730 = 1, 2 or 5) was added with 0.2 ml 10 mM NaH 14 CO 3 (set as time 0 min). ATP measurements The following procedure was based on Rust et al. 52 with modifications. A total of 0.4 ml WT and Δxpk cultures (triplicate batches for both) were transferred to 1.5-ml tubes containing 0.14 ml 3 M HClO 4 and 77 mM EDTA. The mixture was then frozen with liquid nitrogen to stop the reactions and lyse cells. Next, the samples were defrosted and neutralized with 0.26 ml solution, containing 1 M KOH, 0.5 M Tris and 0.5 M KCl, to adjust the pH to 7. After 14,000 g centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was collected for ATP measurements. Then, 38 µl supernatant was diluted with 62 µl buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 25 mM KCl and 50 mM MgSO 4 . To plot the ATP standard curve, 1 nM to 1 µM ATP solutions were prepared in parallel. The 100 µl sample and ATP solutions were transferred to an opaque 96-well plate and 100 µl luciferase-based BacTiter-Glo assay solution was added to each sample well. The luminescence signals from each reaction and standard were measured and then the ATP amount was quantified as showed in Figs. 2 and 4a . The measurement of O 2 evolution and consumption The amount of O 2 evolution and consumption in cells was analyzed using a Clark-type oxygen electrode along with a water-jacket cell 53 . The cell cultures (grown under light intensity of 50 μmol m 2 s −1 ) containing 10 μg Chla were mixed with 2 mM potassium ferricyanide and 2,6-dichloro-p-benzoquinone (an artificial electron acceptor) in a 1-ml reaction. The reaction mixture was then placed in a stirred water-jacket cell under dark. The O 2 consumption of the cell culture was quantified by measuring the decreased amount of O 2 (μmol Chla mg −1 h −1 ). To quantify the amount of O 2 evolution from water split during photosynthesis, the cell culture was supplied with saturated light (Supplementary Table 2 ). Quantification of the 13 C-labeled sugar phosphates and acetyl-CoA The WT and Δxpk cultures (50 ml, three batches for each) were first grown under continuous light and then refreshed with BG11 medium before 13 C-labeling. At time 0, the cultures were added with 2 mM NaH 13 CO 3 and simultaneously, the light was switched off. Samples (2 ml, OD 730 adjusted to 1) were collected from individual cultures at different time points before (−5, 0 min) and after dark (1, 3, 5 min and so on). The collected cultures were then subjected to 14,000 g centrifuge for 10 s. The pelleted cells were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. The following metabolite extraction procedure was based on Dempo et al. 54 and Lunn et al. 55 with modifications. The frozen cell pellets were first mixed with a 200-µl solution (methanol:chloroform:water in a 5:2:2 ratio (v/v)) and then subjected to freeze–vortex–thaw steps for three rounds to disrupt the cell wall. Next, samples were placed in −30 °C for 2 h and subsequently mixed with 150 µl cold water before being centrifuged at 400 g for 15 min to isolate aqueous phase from protein and nonpolar phase. This cold-water extraction step was repeated once. Then, the aqueous phase was dried by speedVac at 30 °C before adding 100–200 µl water to resuspend the samples. To remove macromolecules, the sample solutions were applied to 10-kDa Ultracell centrifugation tubes. After 10 min centrifugation at 14,000 g , the flowthrough solution containing phosphosugars and soluble metabolites was isolated for following liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) analyses. Each sample (10 µl) was loaded to triple quadrupole Shimadzu LC–MS 8045 with YMC-Triart C18 ExRS (metal-free column) (150 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.9 µm, product no. TAR08SP9-15Q1PTP) at a 0.40 ml min −1 flow rate. Separation was performed as described by Campos et al. 56 , starting with 100% solvent A. Solvent B was increased linearly to 7.5% over 10 min after the starting point. From 10–13 min, solvent B was increased to 52.6% linearly and was maintained until 15 min. From 15–25 min, 98% solvent B was used to remove the remnant. From 25–30 min, solvent B was decreased to 0% for column equilibration. The column temperature was maintained at 50 °C. LC–MS/MS was set in the negative mode with spectra acquired over a mass range of 50–1,000 m/z. The acquisition parameters were as follows: interface temperature, 250 °C; desolvation line temperature, 200 °C; heat block temperature, 400 °C; desolvation gas, nitrogen; nebulizing gas flow rate, 3.0 l min −1 ; drying gas, nitrogen; drying gas flow rate, 5 l min −1 . All metabolites and their labeling patterns were measured by multiple reaction monitoring in the negative mode. Each peak area of 12 C- and 13 C-incoroporated metabolite was quantified. The 13 C-incorporated % of individual metabolite was calculated as ( 13 C-compound / 12 C-compound) and shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1 . Statistical significance difference of the 13 C-incorporated % between the WT and Δxpk was analyzed by one-way ANOVA ( n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± s.e.m.). Sugar and biomass composition measurements To obtain high-cell-density cultures, both WT and Δxpk cultures were grown until OD 730 reached 2–3 and then were refreshed with BG11 medium before adjusting the OD 730 to 4. An equal volume of individual culture was supplemented with 100 mM NaHCO 3 and inoculated in a Corning 75-cm 2 cell culture flask for 4 d under shaking at 70 r.p.m. Two aliquots of 1-ml culture from WT and Δxpk were collected and placed in Costar Spin-X centrifuge tube filters and spun at 15,000 g for 1 min, to separate cells and medium. The medium sample (2 ml) was collected for extracellular sugar content analyses (Fig. 4g ). Equal amounts of the cell pellet were used for glycogen and intracellular sucrose measurements (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Fig. 4g ). The metabolite extraction method is described above. For extracellular sugar content measurements, 100-μl medium samples were first mixed with known amount of lactate as an internal control and then subjected to 3-kDa Ultracell centrifuge tubes to remove macroparticles. Then, 10 μl of the clear flowthrough was analyzed by a UHPLC Agilent 1290 infinity II system at 50 °C, using Hi-Plex H hydrogen 8 µm, 300 × 6.5 mm column. By isocratic elution with 30 mM sulfuric acid at 0.4 ml min −1 flow rate, the glucose and sucrose contents were separated and detected by the refractive index detector. The amount of lactic acid was detected by the diode array detector at UV wavelength 210 nm. For intracellular sucrose and glucose measurements, the sample extracts were quantified by monitoring the NADH production using a colorimetric method. The concentrations of the standard NADH samples were prepared from 0.125 mM to 1 mM. The extracts containing sucrose and glucose were digested to glucose and fructose by mixing with 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 6 U invertase (from baker’s yeast, Sigma-Aldrich), at 55 °C for 1 h. The cell pellet for glycogen measurement was mixed with 200 μl KOH 30% (v/v) then boiled for 30 min. Acetic acid was added to the sample for adjusting the pH to 7 at room temperature. The sample was then mixed with the enzymatic digesting reagent, containing 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 6 U ml −1 amyloglucosidase and 50 U ml −1 α-amylase. The reactions were held at 37 °C for 2 h to catalyze glycogen to glucose and then stopped by heating to 99 °C for 10 min. Then, 50 μl the digested samples were transferred to a 96-well plate and mixed with 100 μl solution containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP, 1 mM NAD and 0.6 U hexokinase (from baker’s yeast, Sigma-Aldrich) to convert glucose to G6P. The absorption reading of NADH at OD 340 was used as a blank. Subsequently, 0.9 μl G6P dehydrogenase (from Leuconostoc mesenteroides , Roche) was added to each reaction that converted G6P and NAD to phosphogluconate and NADH. The OD 340 reading was recorded per minute until the values reached a plateau. The method above was also used to quantify intracellular glucose content without invertase reactions, where the sucrose content was calculated by subtracting the glucose content. For biomass measurements (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b ), 2-ml cultures were transferred to pre-weighted Costar Spin-X centrifuge tubes. After centrifugation and freeze-drying overnight, the dry-cell weight of the cultures was quantified. The carbon content of the biomass was calculated using the formula CH 1.81 N 0.17 O 0.20 P 0.013 S 0.009 (ref. 57 ) . The total protein content (Extended Data Fig. 2d ) of the freeze-dried samples was quantified using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Net carbon fixation and respiratory CO 2 release measurements For net carbon fixation measurements, the 0.5-ml culture sample described above was collected at the end of each day and night for 4 d. The collected sample was transferred to a 20-ml glass screw-top vial. An equal volume of 37% HCl was then injected to the sample to release CO 2 into the headspace of the vial. The headspace was loaded into an Agilent Technologies 7890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 5977B mass spectrometer. A DB-FFAP column (Agilent Technologies, 0.32 mm × 30 m × 0.25 μm) was used to detect the amount of CO 2 released from the sample (Fig. 4e,f ). An NaHCO 3 standard curve was prepared using 0–100 mM NaHCO 3 . RNA-seq A total of 5 ml WT and Δxpk cultures (OD 730 ~ 1, three cultures for each genotype) were collected at four time points (light 1 h, 1 h after switching to light; light 12 h, 12 h illumination; dark 1 h, 1 h after switching to dark; and dark 12 h, 12 h darkness). Cells were pelleted by full-speed centrifugation for 10 s, frozen with liquid nitrogen and then stored at −80 °C until samples were collected from all time points. Cell pellets were washed once with 300 μl QIAGEN RNAprotect cell reagent and centrifuged to remove the supernatant. Cells were frozen with liquid nitrogen and then thawed by adding 350 μl RLT solution, provided by the QIAGEN RNeasy kit. After three rounds of freeze–thaw–vortex steps, the samples were centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. Supernatant was transferred to the tubes and mixed with an equal volume of 100% ethanol. The mixture was then transferred to the RNeasy mini-spin columns. The following procedure was based on the QIAGEN RNeasy kit and the Invitrogen TURBO DNA-free kit. For RNA-seq experiments, RNA quality control was performed by Agilent fragment analyzer 5200. Library preparation and ribosomal RNA depletion were performed by using Illumina Ribo-Zero Plus rRNA depletion kit. All sequencing was performed on an Illumina Nextseq 2000 with P2 flowcell, 300 cycles and paired ends of 150 bp. Data were processed using CLC genomics workbench 21. Differential gene expression between WT and XPK was examined across all conditions (across group, ANOVA-like), with TMM normalization. The volcano plot y axis showed P value (−log 10 ) between WT and Δxpk (Extended Data Fig. 3a ). A heat map was generated using values normalized through trimmed mean of M values (TMM) and count per million (CPM) methods, with k -means clustering k = 4 for gene clustering (Extended Data Fig. 3b ). The RNA-seq data are deposited in NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus datasets under accession no. GSE227397 . Frequency-dependent phenotype experiments To observe the growth phenotype of WT and Δxpk mutant under different frequency L/D cycles, the cell cultures (six batches for both genotypes) were first grown under continuous light until OD 730 reading reached or just over 1. The starting cultures (1 ml) of the WT and Δxpk cells were adjusted with culture medium to obtain the same cell density with OD 730 = 1 (the 10 0 culture in Fig. 5a ). Tenfold serial dilutions were made from the starting culture to obtain three additional cultures annotated as 10 −1 , 10 −2 and 10 −3 . Six aliquots (10 μl each) of the individual culture were simultaneously dropped onto the same BG11 plates to give six replicated cell dots. After allowing dots to dry under continuous light, the plates were imaged (day 0) and then subjected to different L/D frequency cycles for 4 d. The images of the plates were taken every 24 h. Autofluorescence images were taken by Fujifilm LAS-4000 at 520 nm excitation and 575DF20 emission filter. The mean autofluorescence intensity of each cell dot (from 10 −1 ) and the mean background intensity were analyzed by ImageJ. The calibrated autofluorescence of each cell dot was obtained (Fig. 5b ) after subtraction of the background intensity. Cryo-EM specimen preparation and data collection Cryo-EM samples were prepared by applying 4 µl freshly purified Se XPK (~0.4 mg ml −1 , equivalent to 2.2 µM of dimer, protein buffer containing 20 mM HEPES–NaOH (pH 7.2), 0.1 M NaCl, 0.2 mM TPP and 1 mM MgCl 2 ) to a holey carbon grid (Quantifoil R 1.2/1.3, 300 mesh copper). The grids were glow-charged at 25 mA for 40 s. For the bound form, AMPPNP was added to the protein sample at a final concentration of 2 mM. The mixture was incubated on ice for at least 30 min before applying to the cryo-grids. After sample application, the grids were subsequently blotted for 4 s at 4 °C in a 95% humidity-controlled chamber, followed by plunge freezing in liquid ethane using a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To obtain the top-viewed orientation of Se XPK particles, the grid surface was pre-modified with 0.1 mg ml −1 poly- l -lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) immediately after glow discharge. For B. longum , the XPK sample grid was prepared without using poly- l -lysine because the preferred orientation issue was improved by tilting the specimen stage for an angle of 30°. Cryo-EM specimen grids were imaged on a Titan Krios microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV. For Se XPK samples, dose-fractionated image stacks were recorded on a K2 Summit detector (Gatan) operating in counting mode at ×165,000 nominal magnification (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.82 Å per pixel). Sixty frames of non-gain normalized tiff stacks were recorded with a dose rate of ~13.1 e − Å −2 s −1 and the total exposure time was set to 4.5 s, resulting in an accumulated dose of ~59 e − Å −2 (~1 e − Å −2 per frame). For the B. longum XPK sample, images were recorded on a BioQuantum K3 detector (Gatan) operating in super-resolution mode at ×105,000 nominal magnification (corresponding to a pixel size of 0.415 Å per pixel). Forty frames of non-gain normalized tiff stacks were recorded with a dose rate of ~16.8 e − Å −2 s −1 and the total exposure time was set to 2.5 s, resulting in an accumulated dose of ~42 e − Å −2 (~1 e − Å −2 per frame). The datasets were obtained with nominal defocus values ranging from 1.5–2.5 µm and data collection parameters were controlled in an automated manner using EPU v.2.10 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). No energy filter or objective aperture was implemented during data collection. The data collection parameters of individual datasets are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Cryo-EM data processing and 3D reconstruction All three datasets were corrected for beam-induced motion by MotionCor2 (ref. 58 ) and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation was performed with Gctf 59 on the dose-weighted, aligned micrographs. For the Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ -AMPPNP-bound form and Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ datasets collected in the counting mode, unbinned movies were motion corrected and the pixel size 0.82 Å per pixel was unchanged. For B. longum XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ datasets collected in the super-resolution mode, the movies were binned twice during motion correction, resulting in a pixel size of 0.83 Å per pixel for the final motion-corrected images. For the Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ -AMPPNP-bound form, initial particle picking was manually conducted using Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) with a small subset of micrographs. The picked particles were subjected to 2D classification. The good 2D classes were used as templates for auto-picking particles from 2,839 micrographs, which yielded particle images ( n = 260,589) for 2D classification and eliminated bad particles. Further, approximately half of the particles ( n = 123,625) were selected for three-dimensional (3D) initial model reconstruction and followed by auto-refine in C6 symmetry. The resulting 3D model and particles were then subjected to 3D classification (class 3). One of the classes possessing more than half the particle population yielded a poor 3D model and was not selected. Thus, the 61,183 particles accounting for the other two classes of 3D model were extracted with a box size of 384 pixels using Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) for the following 3D auto-refine with C6 symmetry. The resolution of the resulting 3D model was improved to 2.83 Å. Next, the particles were subjected to CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, which was followed by 3D auto-refine to improve the model resolution to 2.58 Å. The polished particle stacks were imported into cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for further processing. Additional 2D classification was performed to further discard poor particles, which yielded 59,127 particles for following homogeneous refinement in D6 symmetry using cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ). The resulting resolution of the 3D map was improved to 2.36 Å. Next, to further improve the resolution, we performed the focused refinement to refine the density of individual dimer. First, we performed the symmetry expansion (C6) and then the local refinement with a soft mask focused on one dimer without imposing symmetry (C1). The features of the focus-refined dimer were improved and the resolution was improved to 2.17 Å (Supplementary Fig. 4 ). For Se XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ , the initial particle images ( n = 228,398) were picked from 3,983 micrographs and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 . The particles were subjected to 2D classification for filtering junk particles. The remaining particles were used for ab initio 3D model reconstruction followed by auto-refine with C6 symmetry using cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 . The coordinates from cisTEM 1.0.0-β were then imported to Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels for 2D classification to further eliminate the bad particles. The 3D initial model obtained from cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 and CTF refined particles were then subjected to 3D refinement by Relion3.0. For further resolution improvement, the particle images ( n = 44,708) and 3D model were then transferred to cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for 2D classification ( n = 42,625) and 3D classification (class 4). The class possessing 71.9% of the particles was selected and subjected to homogeneous refinement with D6 symmetry. Further, particle stacks in C1 symmetry were generated by symmetry expansion (D6) for the following focused refinement. A soft mask corresponding to one of the dimers was generated for the refinement, which yielded a 3D dimer density map with 2.63 Å resolution (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). For B. longum XPK:TPP/Mg 2+ , approximately 1.26 million particles were picked and extracted with a box size of 384 pixels by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 from 6,289 micrographs. Initial iterations of 2D classification were conducted by cisTEM 1.0.0-β 62 for filtering some junk particles. The coordinates of resulting particles were then transferred to Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ) and extracted with a box size of 64 pixels (384-pixel box size re-scaled to 64 pixels, bin 6) for 2D classification to further eliminate the bad particles. The good particles were re-extracted with a box size of 384 pixels and subjected to ab initio 3D model reconstruction with C4 symmetry. The resulting model and particles were used for 3D classification (class 3) with C4 symmetry. One of the classes, which accounted for 25.9% of the particles and yielded a poor 3D model, was not selected for further refinement. The remaining particles from the other two classes were used for particle polishing and 3D auto-refine by Relion3.0 (ref. 60 ), resulting in a 3D map at 2.72 Å. To further improve the resolution, the polished shiny particles and 3D maps were then transferred to cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ) for homogeneous refinement with D4 symmetry. Then symmetry expansion (D4) was applied to generate the new particle stacks. A soft mask corresponding to one of the dimers was generated for focused refinement, yielding a dimer 3D map with an improved resolution of 2.62 Å (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). As the donut-shape or four-leaf clover shape-like particles or 2D class average images were not in perfect symmetry (Supplementary Figs. 4b , 5b and 6b ), we further examined whether the assigned symmetries were pseudosymmetry. The final 3D cryo-EM map (D6 or D4) was subjected to symmetry expansion and generated particle stacks in C1 symmetry. One of the dimers was subjected to 3D classification (class 3). The resulting particles in each class were further used for 3D reconstruction in C1 symmetry. The animated illustrations (3D model and link shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 ) were made using the three reconstructed maps to highlight the conformational motions of the Se XPK dodecamer and B. longum XPK octamer molecules. Relative movements were observed between different dimers. On the other hand, animated illustrations of the focus-refined dimers from 3D classification (class 3) indicated negligible global variation within the dimer subunits, except a few subtle local differences. Based on these analyses, both Se XPK and B. longum XPK are suggested to exist in pseudosymmetry. The Fourier shell correlation = 0.143 standard was used to estimate the overall resolution and the local resolution was calculated by cryoSPARC2.0 (ref. 61 ). UCSF-Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ) was used to visualize the 3D density map. The detailed refinement statistics for both the dodecamer/octamer and the focus-refined dimer of individual datasets are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Atomic modeling, refinement and validation An initial model of Se XPK was generated based on PDB 3AI7 (ref. 28 ) and Se XPK amino acid sequence by using Swiss-Model 64 . This initial model was fit into the cryo-EM focused refined map in UCSF-Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ) and Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ). AMPPNP and TPP/Mg 2+ molecules were manually built into the cryo-EM map with Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ). Initial rounds of rigid body and real-space refinement were performed using Phenix v.1.19 (ref. 66 ). Each subunit may be clearer at different residues. Some local discrepancy of model fitting was rebuilt manually using Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ) based on the densities from both dimer subunits. A similar approach was used for B. longum XPK, for which the crystal structure PDB 3AI7 (ref. 29 ) was used as an initial model for model building. The refined dimer was further fit into the D6 ( Se XPK) or D4 ( B. longum XPK)-symmetrized 3D cryo-EM map for obtaining the dodecamer or octamer assembly, respectively. Initial iterations of refinement were performed using real-space refinement in Phenix v.1.19 (ref. 66 ). Several iterations of manual adjustment of the protein coordinate in Coot v.0.8.8 (ref. 65 ) followed by real-space refinement in Rosetta 67 were performed while monitoring model quality with MolProbity 68 . Several iterations of real-space refinement on the entire model were completed until refinement statistics converged. The detailed statistics of data processing, model refinement and validation are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . Structural visualization and rendering of structural representation were performed using PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, v.2.4.1 Schrödinger and Chimera v.1.15 (ref. 63 ). Protein Data Bank structural search procedures Structures complexed with ATP or five ATP analogs (ANP, ACP, APC, ZAN and AGS) were obtained from the PDB 32 . There were a total of 3,063 structures (April 2021). The structures that match all of the following criteria were selected for analysis: (1) a distance of ≤5 Å between the atom C5 of the adenine ring and the atom CG (γ-carbon) of paired aromatic residues (Y, W, F and H); and (2) a distance of ≤5 Å between the phosphorus atom PG of the γ-phosphate group and the atom CZ of a nearby arginine residue. Another search only focusing on criterion (1) with an additional 2,870 structures complexed with ADP or AMP was also performed. The corresponding protein names of the matched structures are listed in Source Data File 1 . Abbreviations for the molecules in this search were ANP, AMPPNP, phosphoaminophosphonic acid adenylate ester; ACP, AMP-PCP, phosphomethylphosphonic acid adenylate ester; APC, AMP-CPP, diphosphomethylphonic acid adenosyl ester; ZAN, AMP-NPP, adenosine-5′-(α,β)-imido triphosphate; AGS, ATPγS, phosphothiophosphoric acid adenylate ester; ADP, adenosine-5′-diphosphate; AMP, adenosine monophosphate; and ATP, adenosine-5′-triphosphate. Protein database search and alignment The conservation of ATP-binding sequence motif in the phosphoketolase family was investigated using Se XPK protein sequence as a query to search in a non-reductant NCBI protein BLAST database 34 , including GeneBank CDS translations, PDB and SwissProt, with a total number of 369,802,622 sequences (5 April 2021). The BLASTP was used as a search algorithm and the alignment score was assigned based on Matrix BLOSUM62. The number of target search sequence was 5,000. Among the 5,000 sequences, 4,930 sequences share at least 60% identity with the query sequence. These sequences were subjected to multiple sequence alignment 69 . Additional searches were performed for the specific genera listed in Fig. 7b (rows 9–12) but with <60% identity to the Se XPK, particularly in Bifidobacterium (NCBI taxid, 1678), Lactococcus (NCBI taxid, 1357) and Lactobacillus (NCBI taxid, 1578). None was found in the non-ATP-regulated Bifidobacterium (total 112 sequences, with sequence identity >50%) or Lactobacillus (462 sequences with sequence identity >40%). Finally, Lactococcus was also examined as it is representative of homofermentative bacteria used in synthetic biology and the XPK structure from L. lactis has been reported 27 , 28 , 29 . No ATP-regulatory site was found from 93 sequences with >40% identity to S. elongatus . Statistics and reproducibility All the above measurements included three biological repeats for each genotype as the sampling size, except the phenotype experiment, for which six biological repeats for each genotype were used. With the sample size of three, the mean value, s.e.m. and the one-sided statistical t -test via one-way ANOVA can be determined. When the measuring values were under the detecting limit (by LC–MSMS) or extremely high/low from the kinetic curves, the data points were excluded. The samples were blindly numbered and randomly loaded to analytical devices. We repeated the experiments to assess the carbon incorporation rates, carbohydrate productions and enzymatic kinetics three times and to evaluate the growth phenotype twice. Similar results between different experimental repeats were obtained. For cryo-EM experiments, thousands of micrographs were collected for the individual dataset.

Extended data Extended Data Fig. 1 Steady-state kinetic analysis of XPK. a . Se XPK (V max 10.8 ± 0.1 µmole mg −1 min −1 ; K m 19 ± 1.5 mM) is inhibited by 1 or 2 mM of ATP, in the presence of 30 mM phosphate. b . Under the same condition, B. longum XPK ( Bl XPK) displays no inhibition by ATP. c . Se XPK is not inhibited by phosphate substrate in the presence of saturating F6P (150 mM). d . H706A mutant of Se XPK lost most activity. e . Y710A mutant of Se XPK lost most activity. f . H706R mutant of Se XPK shows only minor effect by ATP. g . ADP does not affect Se XPK activity. The inhibition curve with ATP is included for comparison. h . Methylomonas sp . XPK ( Me XPK) is also inhibited by ATP, though to a lesser extent than Se XPK. An enlarged view of the inset is shown in i . Data represent n = 3 individual reactions, mean ± SEM. Each plot represents one of the three experimental repeats. Source data Extended Data Fig. 2 Deletion of Se XPK enhanced sucrose production but did not alter biomass. a, b . Biomass and the cell optical density (OD 730 ) increase approximately equally in three WT and three Δxpk cultures in four days. c . Glycogen contents from equal volume of the three WT or the three Δxpk culture were measured in four days. d . protein content of the WT and the Δxpk in four days. e . The weights of biomass, protein, sucrose, glycogen and glucose were measured from the three WT and the three Δxpk cultures after four days. ** indicated the significant difference between the WT and the Δxpk in sucrose productions, using one-sided statistical t -test via one-way Anova. The p value = 3 × 10 −6 . a – e : n = 3 biological repeats, value = mean ± SEM. Source data Extended Data Fig. 3 Transcriptional differences between WT and Δxpk across 4 time points. WT and Δxpk were grown under 12 h L/D cycle till OD 730 reached 2. The samples were harvested 1 h after dark, at the end of dark, 1 h after light and at the end of light. Equal amount of RNA was extracted from both culture for RNA-seq analysis. a . Volcano plot between WT and Δxpk (n = 3 biological repeats, mean ± SEM). A few genes showed significant changes (red dots, p < 0.05). Their expressional fold change was less than 2 (x-axis, enlarged plot), except XPK and its downstream ACK. Thus, no global changes due to absence of XPK. The y axis represents FDR adjusted p-values, which are computed after first obtaining a two-sided Wald test p value by fitting expression data to a negative binominal Generalized Linear Model (GLM). b . The heat map showed the comparison of the 36 genes that appeared different in expression levels between WT and Δxpk (ANOVA-like statistical analysis by CLC) at 4 different time points. XPK was peaked at the end of light as an evening gene. However, the transcriptional differences are small as the z-values are ± 2. Source data Extended Data Fig. 4 Cryo-EM structures of free forms of Se XPK and B. longum XPK. a . Se XPK dodecamer and its dimer unit, with its N-, middle, and C-subdomains colored in light blue, marine and dark blue in one subunit, while the other subunit is colored in gray for differentiation. The distribution of the residues (shown in magenta spheres) involved in the dimer-dimer interface of the dodecamer XPK are primarily located at the C-terminal subdomain. The coenzyme TPP/Mg 2+ is shown in yellow/green spheres . b . B. longum XPK octamer and its dimer unit. The dimer is shown in orange and gray for each monomer. The residues involved in the dimer-dimer interface of octamer XPK are highlighted in magenta spheres. They are predominantly located at the N-terminal subdomain, in contrast to the Se XPK dodecamer. Extended Data Fig. 5 Representative cryo-EM density maps of the AMPPNP, and the key elements involved in the allosteric regulation of Se XPK. a . The representative electron density for AMPPNP modeling (residue from B subunit is labeled with a prime). A weak density blob was observed adjacent to the –PPNP moiety of AMPPNP, which appears to be too weak to be a magnesium ion. In addition, no carboxylate is in close distance (<3 Å). Therefore, it is tentatively assigned as a water molecule bridging His719 or His706 with the phosphate groups of the AMPPNP. b . The modeling of residues YPW in the free- and AMPPNP-bound XPK. In free XPK, the density can merely accomendate one W703 from either A or B subunit. Therefore, the two W703 residues are alternatively positioned downwards and upwards. Conversely, upon AMPPNP binding, the individual W703 can be modeled in two conformers, giving a dynamic swing-like motion. c . Cryo-EM density map for modeling the active site loop region (V534-S546) of AMPPNP-bound Se XPK. d . The electron density for modeling Y492 in free- and AMPPNP-bound XPK. Extended Data Fig. 6 Structural comparison of the C-terminal domain interface in S. elongatus and B. longum XPKs in the free form. a . Left: structural superimposition of the dimer form between S. elongatus (dark/light blue) and B. longum (orange/gray) with RMSD 1.046 Å from 1291 Cα atoms of the respective dimer shows the C-terminal domain (in cartoon cylindrical presentation) interface of the subunits, mainly constituted of two helices from individual subunits. Middle: the approximate distance between the helices is 10 Å in S. elongatus , wider than 7.7 Å measured in B. longum XPK. Right: the view of the interface from above (circled with red dash lines). b . Stereo view showing the different residues and distances at the ATP-binding interface in the two XPKs. In addition to the narrower space between the helices compared to the S. elongatus , B. longum XPK has an Arg replacing H706 of Se XPK, Asn replacing R721, and Met replacing R753. Therefore, B. longum is unfavorable for ATP binding. Extended Data Fig. 7 Stereo view of the expanded views of the ATP allosteric site of Se XPK. a . The free state, providing the combined views of Fig. 3g,i,k . b . Bound with AMPPNP, providing combined views of Fig. 3h,j,l . Comparison between the free and bound structures here and in the main text provides detailed information on the effect of ATP binding, for all 8 residues in the conserved motif P702, W703, H706, Y’710, R’711, H719, R721, R753 as well as the key helices α24 and α19. Since the main text focuses more on the interaction with α24, here we provide detailed explanation for the interaction with α24, which also involves dynamic features of W703 (density maps in Extended Data Fig. 5b ). P702 resides at a turn connecting the helix α24 and the loop where W703 and Y701 respectively reside. Therefore, it provides certain degree of flexibility to the local region. In the free XPK, the W703 from one subunit can reside at two positions, swinging upwards and downwards, but alternates with the other W703. When the W703 side chain swings upwards, it partially occupies the ATP binging space. In the AMPPNP-bound structure, both W703 residues swing downwards and show subtle side chain movement (side-to-side), which is stabilized by the cation-pi interaction with K707 and an H-bond between C=O of Y701 and NH of W703. Such interaction is also likely facilitated by P702. The three residues form a beta-turn like configuration to keep W703 side chain pointing downwards and interact with D551 or N555 from helix α19. In addition, the dynamic feature of W703, assisted by its neighboring residue P702, could function as a regulatory switch in response to ATP binding. Extended Data Fig. 8 Structure-based PDB searches. a . The PDB search criteria: (1) The distances (Å) between the atom C5 of the adenine ring and the atom CG of the Y710/H706 side chain. The tyrosine and histidine are from different subunits. (2) The distance between the phosphorous atom PG of the gamma-phosphate group and the atom CZ of a neighboring arginine. These distances were relaxed to ≤5 Å in the search. The two subunits of a dimer are designated as A and B. b–d . Nucleotide binding modes of the three closest search hits. The cases ( b , c ) are the same protein crystalized with ADP and AMPPNP 28 . In all three cases 28 , 29 , the nucleotide binds to the dimer interface, and interacts with the aromatic residues from different protein chains of the dimer. However, only one aromatic residue forms base stacking with the adenine ring. Details of the search data are shown in Source Data File 1 .

There are many kinds of HABs, caused by a variety of algal groups with different toxins. The HABs in fresh and marine waters are usually very different, but they overlap in low salinity estuaries (places where rivers meet the sea). The human illnesses caused by HABs, though rare, can be debilitating or even fatal. States have rigorous monitoring programs to ensure that commercially harvested fish and shellfish are safe to eat. HABs have been reported in every U.S. coastal state, and their occurrence may be on the rise. HABs are a national concern because they affect not only the health of people and marine ecosystems, but also the ""health"" of local and regional economies. Regional Information Gulf of Mexico/Florida Great Lakes West Coast/Alaska East Coast Harmful Algal Bloom Resources Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring System Detection, Monitoring, Imagery NOAA HAB Forecasts Bulletins How do we forecast HABs? Ocean Fact What is red tide? Video All about HABs Explainer HAB Research Stressors & Mitigation Frequently Asked Questions What is a harmful algal bloom? Algae are a beneficial part of natural environments and only a few are harmful.Â Harmful algal blooms (HABs) can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Some HABs produce toxins that have harmful effects on people, fish, marine mammals, and birds. The toxins produced by algae vary by species and region, and impact organisms in different ways. HAB species and their impacts vary significantly from region to region.Â Information on the health effects of HABs on marine animals, shellfish, and people is available from NOAA , the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . What is the difference between a marine and freshwater HAB? Algae are the bottom of the food chain in all natural environments. Only a few are harmful.Â HABs can occur in fresh, marine (salt), and brackish (a mixture of fresh and salt) water bodies around the world. They are caused by diverse organisms, including toxic and noxious phytoplankton , cyanobacteria, benthic algae, and macroalgae. Cyanobacteria , a type of photosynthetic bacteria also known as blue-green algae, are often the cause of algal blooms in freshwater and occasionally in marine water. As the name implies, they often (but not always) discolor the water bright green or blue green and form scum. A combination of environmental factors such as the presence of nutrients, warm temperatures, and lots of light encourage the natural increase in the numbers of cyanobacteria.Â Cyanobacteria HABs produce multiple toxins , including liver, nerve, and skin toxins, which can affect human and animal health. The most common cyanobacterial HAB toxins in the U.S. are microcystins, a group of liver toxins that can cause gastrointestinal illness in humans, and mortality in pets, livestock, and wildlife. Alternatively, dinoflagellates and diatoms , different types of phytoplankton, are the most common HAB species in marine and brackish waters, including estuaries. Some of these blooms discolor the water different shades of red and brown and a few are bioluminescent.Â While the causes of individual marine HAB events have been shown to vary across years and locations, nutrient inputs may help sustain an event once the bloom reaches the shoreline. Some dinoflagellate species produce cysts, which are dormant “seeds” that are created during a bloom and are capable of living through harsh conditions. When favorable conditions resume, the cysts rupture, germinate, and populate the water column with a new generation of photosynthetically active cells primed for another bloom. Marine HABs produce toxins that may result in neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning, , diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, ciguatera poisoning in fish, respiratory irritation in humans, or shellfish contamination. Some marine HABs also affect the central nervous system of fish, marine mammals, and birds. In both marine and freshwater environments, there are also HABs that do not directly affect humans but can kill fish, shellfish, and invertebrates or cause other ecosystem impacts such as shading submerged aquatic vegetation, smothering corals, or causing oxygen in the water to be depleted .Â For example, fish kills in freshwater may be caused by golden algae and brown tides , which result in many ecosystem impacts in estuaries. Is the HAB in my state the same as in Florida? The varieties of HABs, the toxins they produce, and the impacts they cause vary significantly from region to region. HABs are a multi-faceted threat with different environmental factors leading to the prevalence of different algal species, as well as the presence or absence of toxins. These factors include physical and biological conditions that influence HAB growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Learn more about specific HABs and available resources where you live from our regional HAB pages. How does NOAA forecast harmful algal blooms? NOAA's Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring System provides products for the Gulf of Maine , Lake Erie , and in Florida , Louisiana , and North Carolina . These monitoring products identify the location and extent of the bloom and rely on satellite imagery, field observations, models, public health reports, and buoy data to provide information on bloom events. Additionally, NOAA’s Harmful Algal Bloom Operational Forecast System bulletins and condition reports are available for the Gulf of Mexico and Lake Erie . The HAB forecasts and bulletins alert coastal managers to blooms before they result in serious damage and identify the risk of respiratory irritation in a county over the coming days. Short-term (once or twice weekly) forecasts identify which blooms are potentially harmful, where they are, how big they are, and where they're likely headed. Longer-term, seasonal forecasts predict the severity of HABs for the bloom season in a particular region. The bulletins provide decision-makers with a more in-depth analysis of the current bloom location and reported impacts, as well as forecasts of potential development, intensification, transport, and associated impacts of blooms. NOAA is funding researchers and local agencies in other regions of the U.S. to develop new forecasting and monitoring systems, including the Gulf of Maine , the central and southern California coast , and the Pacific Northwest . What areas are prone to harmful algal blooms? HABs occur in all U.S. waters . According to the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act, NOAA has purview over HABs in marine environments, whereas the Environmental Protection Agency is focused on freshwater HABs that occur in all U.S. states. NOAA and EPA share authority over the Great Lakes with regards to HABs. Visit the NOAA Ecological Forecasting page to see ecological forecasting ""hotspots"" in marine/coastal environments or the Great Lakes, or select a region at the top of this page to learn more about region-specific resources. How long does a HAB event last? The duration of a HAB event depends on a number of factors and is not possible to predict in advance. For example, red tides in Florida can last as little as a few weeks to longer than a year. They may even subside and then reoccur. The duration of a bloom depends on physical and biological conditions that influence its growth and persistence, including sunlight, water temperature, nutrients, and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents. Can a HAB be stopped? HABs can’t be stopped but control methods are currently being investigated. In the early 2000s, NOAA funded studies to test the use of clays to control red tides. Since that time, different types of clays have been developed that have fewer environmental effects and are in the initial phases of testing. This method involves a modified clay mineral that, when dispersed into the ocean surface, binds with red tide cells and the toxins they produce and carries them to the seafloor where they are eventually buried. Additionally, many other control methods are being tested. For example, engineers at Nano Air Bubble Aeration System Technology are researching an environmentally sustainable method to eliminate harmful freshwater algae and their toxins. The method uses nanobubbles â bubbles smaller than the width of a single human hair â to aerate water bodies and create ozone that helps dissolve harmful algae. Another instance is the examination of a chemical control agent isolated from a bacteria species that may provide a mechanism for halting the growth of certain types of toxic dinoflagellate harmful algal blooms while having no negative impacts on other organisms . How do you find out if it is safe to go to the beach or harvest shellfish during a HAB? Some beach areas may be more affected than others during a HAB event. Check local health departments and local governmental websites for the latest information about HAB events and safety. If you have a chronic respiratory condition, avoid beaches during HAB events. What do you do if you see injured, sick, stranded, or dead wildlife? Do not touch or try to rescue any animal that appears to be impacted by HABs. Reporting sick, injured, entangled, stranded, or dead animal is the best way to make sure professional responders and scientists know about it and can take appropriate action. Numerous organizations around the country are trained and ready to respond. If you see a sick, injured, stranded, or dead marine mammal or sea turtle, immediately contact your local stranding network. Visit the NOAA Fisheries website and follow the instructions. You can also use Fisheries’ Dolphin and Whale 911 app for Apple devices to report a stranded marine mammal. How can harmful algal blooms affect pets? Because of their behavior, dogs are much more susceptible than humans to cyanobacterial poisoning, which is typically found in freshwater bodies and some estuaries. When toxins are present, dogs can be exposed to toxins by drinking the water, by eating washed up mats or scum of toxic cyanobacteria, and by having skin contact with water. Dogs are often attracted to algal scum odors. After leaving the water, dogs can also be poisoned by grooming their fur and paws. If your dog has been swimming in a lake or pond with a suspected or identified HAB, closely monitor your dog for any signs of cyanobacterial poisoning and be sure to rinse the dog with clean water. Signs of poisoning can occur within 30 minutes to a few hours after exposure, depending on the size of the dog, the type of toxin, the toxin concentration, and how much toxin the dog has ingested. In severe cases, dogs can show signs of cyanobacterial poisoning within a few minutes and can die within an hour of toxin exposure. NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science provides additional information and resources for protecting your dog from HABs . Although there is not a large body of data, there are reports of other HABs affecting dogs. As a precaution, do not allow dogs to swim in discolored water, roll in or eat algae piled on the beach, or run and play on beaches where humans are experiencing respiratory problems.

Cyanobacteria, also referred to as blue-green algae, are microscopic bacteria that live in all types of bodies of water. Cyanobacteria may occur as single cells, threads or as colonies. The two most common facts are phosphorous and nitrogen in water bodies, which are found in fertilizers and human and animal waste. ""Certain environmental conditions, such as warm weather, sunlight, excess nutrients, and stagnant/slow-moving waters help cyanobacteria grow faster,"" according to the state's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) . When do Massachusetts cities and towns have to issue an advisory for cyanobacteria? The state's Department of Public Health (DPH) recommends municipalities issue an advisor if a visible scum is present, the algal cell count exceeds 70,000 cells per milliliter of water, and if certain toxins produced by cyanobacteria are above a certain threshold set by the state. In 2022, DPH was aware of 55 cyanoHAB advisories – 30 that were recommended by DPH and 25 issued by local health departments. Where are there cyanobacteria blooms so far in 2023 Massachusetts' Department of Public Health maintains a list of cyanobacteria bloom advisories. As of June 14, there were six advisories, which were Lake Waushakum in Framingham/Ashland, Mystic Lake in Barnstable, Mashpee-Wakeby Pond in Mashpee, Miacomet Pond in Nantucket, Scokes Pond in Plymouth and Dean Park Pond in Shrewsbury. DPH regularly updates the list but also advises that when in doubt, stay out of the water. Growth and Develoment: What's next for Natick Mall, shoppers after Wegmans closes later this year? The advisory for Lake Waushakum in Framingham was issued on May 30, according to a city spokesperson. The Department of Public Health will conduct two tests of the water after seven consecutive days of no visible evidence of algae to determine if the advisory can be removed. The water was tested on June 16 and showed amounts below regulation levels. The next test will be performed on June 20. If the second test also is below state regulations, the advisory will be able to be removed, according to a city spokesperson. Are cyanobacteria blooms harmful? Cyanobacteria have the ability to produce toxins called cyanotoxins. When an increase in cyanobacteria population happens, it forms what the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) calls harmful algal blooms (HABs). ""It often results in the waterbody turning bright green or blue-green, and forms a surface scum or a discoloration of the water column,"" according to the DEP's website. According to MassDEP, health concerns depend on the type of cyanobacteria, the route of exposure and the amount of toxins present. ""Ingestion is the primary concern since ingesting small amounts of cyanobacteria or cyanotoxin can cause gastrointestinal symptoms while larger amounts may cause liver or neurological damage,"" the department's website states. In addition, contact with the water spray containing cyanobacteria can cause asthma-like symptoms and can cause skin or eye irritation. Small children and pets are most susceptible to cyanotoxin effects, according the MassDEP . Will cyanobacteria hurt my pets and other animals? There have been documented reports of dog, bird and livestock deaths resulting from consumption of surface water sources with cyanobacteria blooms. Children and pets are more likely to get bacteria in their mouths. Dogs can become very ill and even die from licking cyanobacteria off their fur, according to the DPH. Looking for somethig to read? He took notes during his final visits with his parents. Now Holliston man has a book What can be done about cyanobacteria blooms? Not many options exist for eliminating a bloom, as chemical treatments such as algaecides are not recommended by the DPH. Although not much can be done to eliminate a bloom, many things can be done to prevent blooms. These include maintaining septic systems and storm drains, reducing fertilizer, picking up after pets and not feeding ducks or geese. What should I do if I suspect cyanobacteria in the water If a potential cyanobacteria bloom is at a recreational waterbody, contact the local health department. If the bloom is at a drinking water reservoir, contact the local water department and MassDEP. DPH provides support for local health departments and MassDEP is responsible for blooms found in public water supplies. If contact with cyanobacteria occurs, DPH recommends washing yourself and your pet with tap or bottled water and recommends calling doctor or veterinarian if cyanobacteria water is ingested.

Freshwater cyanobacteria are found in all lakes and reservoirs. Cyanobacteria are naturally occurring and important to water ecosystems. However, excessive growth of these bacteria may cause harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs, also called cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs), which may also produce toxins. These toxins can negatively impact people, animals, and the environment through water recreation (swimming and boating), drinking water, livestock, fisheries and irrigation. Cyanobacterial biomass can result in unsightly surface scums, water taste and odor issues, hypoxia, reduced aquatic diversity and even socio-economic impacts. Due to climate and land use pressures, there is concern that HCBs may increase in frequency, extent, and magnitude, but it can be difficult to know when and where HCBs may form. EPA’s Safe and Sustainable Water Resources research uses a range of data sources and methods to characterize HCBs in waterbodies. One example of this research is a recently published paper from EPA scientists Blake Schaeffer, Wilson Salls, Deron Smith, John Johnston, Mark Myer, and former Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (ORISE) participants Natalie Reynolds and Hannah Ferriby. Their work developed a scientific approach for forecasting freshwater HCBs using satellite data. This approach was the first of its kind to successfully forecast high-risk HCB events across 2,192 of the largest lakes in the contiguous U.S. “There is a lot of ongoing research to forecast HCBs at small scales for lakes, but the novelty of this approach is that it does so at such a broad spatial scale,” Wilson Salls, an EPA environmental scientist, said. The forecasting approach will be especially useful to water quality managers, as it provides a seven-day advanced notice of blooms. In the paper, the authors demonstrated the approach for the entire 2021 calendar year. EPA researcher Wilson Salls preparing instruments on a boat for a satellite overpass. “Our research may be one of the first times that we are examining and predicting water quality analogous to weather forecasting,” Blake Schaeffer, an EPA research scientist, explained. The researchers applied Bayesian modeling, which is a probabilistic statistical method, in combination with satellite monitoring data and a set of simple environmental predictors to estimate the probability of a cyanobacterial bloom occurring in a given week. It used cyanobacteria presence data sourced from the Cyanobacteria Assessment Network (CyAN) project along with environmental predictor variables from 2017 to 2020. The prediction results were compared against the actual cyanobacteria presence observed in satellite imagery to provide performance statistics for 2021. The model’s overall prediction accuracy was 90%. “This research provides a tool that uses a large dataset of past HCB information from satellite imagery, and predictors such as lake morphology, lake temperature, and precipitation, to deliver a good prediction of future HCB events,” Mark Myer, an EPA risk assessor, said. Meet Our Researchers Meet EPA Scientist Blake Schaeffer Meet Our Other Water Researchers The studied model is in direct response to The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act , which requires EPA to advance the scientific understanding and ability to detect, monitor, assess, and predict HAB and hypoxia events in freshwater across the U.S. In the future, this approach may be used operationally to forecast HCBs and help water resource managers and associated public health professionals in their planning and response efforts. “CyAN gave us a powerful tool to provide the monitoring and many of our state and tribal partners rely on that tool. The new model delivers on the forecasting side and the approach will help those same partners get ahead of blooms and provide better protection for human health and the environment,” Michael Paul, an EPA ecologist, said. Schaeffer will present this work at the first HABs, Hypoxia, and Nutrients Research Webinar on January 31 st at 2:00 p.m. ET. This webinar is free to the public and the recording will be posted on the HABs, Hypoxia, and Nutrients webinar series webpage.

The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), along with volunteers, pond associations, towns and the state, is monitoring more than 100 freshwater ponds for concentrations of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and toxins produced by the bacteria. These toxins can affect the liver and nerves, and cause sickness in people and animals. When levels rise, association staff members alert towns. The towns then may post a prohibition on swimming and other activities in the pond until the algal population drops. What causes blue-green algae blooms? The blooms usually occur in the late summer, fueled by warm water or high levels of nutrients from fertilizers, runoff or wastewater seeping through the soil. But Cape ponds remain warm into the fall and algal blooms have occurred as late as December, according to officials. Here are the Cape Cod ponds under alert or watch for cyanobacteria: Mashpee/Sandwich Mashpee-Wakeby Pond in Mashpee and Sandwich is under a public health advisory after samples were taken on June 3 and June 5. The public is advised not to swim in the pond or drink the water. Keep pets away. If you come into contact with the water, rinse off immediately. Orleans Boland Pond in Orleans is under a public health advisory after a sample was taken on June 5. Observed scum was confirmed to be cyanobacteria. The public is advised not to swim in the pond or drink the water. Keep pets away. If you come into contact with the water, rinse off immediately. NOTE: If you notice pond water is scummy or discolored and may have a strong odor, the association advises the public to avoid contact with the water. If you see what might be a suspicious cyanobacteria bloom, notify your local health department and send a photo to cyano@apcc.org noting the location, date and time.

This is in response to a water sample taken on November 29, 2023. The public should exercise caution in and around Blanton Lake . Residents and visitors are advised to take the following precautions: Do not drink, swim, wade, use personal watercraft, water ski or boat in waters where there is a visible bloom. Wash your skin and clothing with soap and water if you have contact with algae or discolored or smelly Keep pets away from the Waters where there are algae blooms are not safe for animals. Pets and livestock should have a different source of water when algae blooms are present. Do not cook or clean dishes with water contaminated by algae Boiling the water will not eliminate the toxins. Eating fillets from healthy fish caught in freshwater lakes experiencing blooms is Rinse fish fillets with tap or bottled water, throw out the guts and cook fish well. Do not eat shellfish in waters with algae. What is blue-green algae? Blue-green algae are a type of bacteria that is common in Florida’s freshwater environments. A bloom occurs when rapid growth of algae leads to an accumulation of individual cells that discolor water and often produce floating mats that emit unpleasant odors. Some environmental factors that contribute to blue-green algae blooms are sunny days, warm water temperatures, still water conditions and excess nutrients. Blooms can appear year-round but are more frequent in summer and fall. Many types of blue-green algae can produce toxins. Is it harmful? Blue-green algae blooms can impact human health and ecosystems, including fish and other aquatic animals.

NH News By Degrees: Covering Climate Change NH on track to set new record for cyanobacteria blooms New Hampshire Public Radio | 
                    By Adriana Martinez-Smiley Published July 31, 2023 at 2:51 PM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Picasa / Courtesy of New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services An algal bloom in a body of water This year is projected to see the highest number of cyanobacteria blooms ever reported in New Hampshire, according to data from the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. Kate Hastings, who monitors cyanobacteria blooms for the state, said cyanobacteria has already passed a number of other records this summer alone. “We'll see how the rest of the year plays out, but we have broken the record for the total number of advisories recorded within each month so far this year,” she said. “In addition to setting the record for the most advisories ever issued within one month. That was set this past June.” Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic microorganisms that can be found in many aquatic environments , including New Hampshire’s lakes. They are known for taking advantage of ecosystem irregularities ; when the conditions are right, cyanobacteria can spread across the surface of a pond or lake, covering the water with a green, algae-like film. While the increase in reports can partially be attributed to increased awareness, Hastings said, there are two additional contributing factors: an uptick in development around water bodies and the impact of climate change. That includes the severe rainstorms we’ve been seeing this summer. “These huge storms bring in big pulses of nutrients all at once, instead of a more regular input of lower nutrients spread out over the duration of the summer,” said Hastings. Other changes, such as less ice cover on many lakes in winter and higher temperatures than normal, can also spur blooms. Cyanobacteria in high densities have the potential to release cyanotoxins . Exposure to these toxins can cause mild to severe health side effects in humans and pets. The state environmental agency recommends avoiding bodies of water that have active cyanobacteria advisories or alerts. Hastings said people should report any suspicious discoloration in local lakes and ponds to the state environmental agency so they can perform testing.

(Jesse Costa/WBUR) Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from WBUR's daily morning newsletter, WBUR Today. If you like what you read and want it in your inbox, sign up here . We finally got a good run of beach-worthy weather this summer, but the heat doesn’t make for great swimming conditions everywhere. You’re probably familiar with the term cyanobacteria by now. Also known as blue-green algae, the toxic blooms have become a regular summertime occurrence in Massachusetts. While the heat may make any local pond alluring, WBUR’s Paula Moura reports the warm weather is contributing to a rise in cyanobacteria blooms across the state , from Arlington to Nantucket to Shrewsbury. An upward trend: The state has issued cyanobacteria advisories for nine ponds this month. That’s a record, topping the previous monthly record of eight set just this past June, according to The Boston Globe . Moura reports climate change is expected to only further fuel this rising trend. Not only does heavy rain carry more stormwater runoff into water bodies , but cyanobacteria grows faster in warm water. “Warmer water coupled with the sunlight in the summer is just a perfect breeding ground for them,” said Lucia Ross, the CMO of Bluegreen Water Technologies, a company that works to reduce cyanobacteria. What’s the worst that could happen? Swimming in water with blue-green algae (and incidentally ingesting it) can lead to stomach trouble, headaches, fever and fatigue. It’s also really not great for pets, which can die if they drink too much of it . How to spot it? State officials stress their advisory list is not exhaustive, so there could be ponds or rivers they’re missing. But as the nickname implies, you’ll notice a green scum on the water’s surface that looks like green paint (similar to the color of pea soup, yet less tasty). Go deeper: Read WBUR’s Barbara Moran’s explainer of everything you need to know about blue-green algae . The future of the birthing center at Leominster Hospital will be in the spotlight tonight. The state Department of Public Health is holding a public hearing on UMass Memorial Health’s plan to close the center in September due to severe staffing shortages and declining patients. WBUR’s Priyanka Dayal McCluskey reports the decision has triggered a backlash from local nurses and community advocates, who say the closure will force patients in the area to travel too far for maternity services. About 500 births occurred at the maternity ward last year. “Babies’ lives are going to be put at risk,” said Eladia Romero, a leader of the Community United to Save Our Birthing Center coalition. “We should be able to have access to this essential service, which is labor and delivery.” Reality check: While UMass Memorial’s plan must be reviewed by the state , regulators can’t stop hospitals from closing services. The most they can do is require the hospital to submit a plan for preserving access to essential services in the area. Boston City Councilor Michael Flaherty thinks his colleague Kendra Lara should join him on the way out the City Hall door this year. Flaherty told NBC 10 Boston this weekend he thinks Lara should resign over the criminal charges she faces for crashing a car last month while driving without a license or registration. “The behavior is one of a habitual scofflaw,” Flaherty said. “To go 10 years without a license isn’t a mistake; it’s the middle finger, frankly.” Lara has apologized for the crash and says she does not plan to resign. The first-term District 6 councilor is facing two opponents in her bid for reelection this fall, per the Boston Herald : IT specialist William King and lawyer Benjamin Weber.

Seasonal blooms of dense algae plague the small subalpine watershed that's butted up against the Continental Divide. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) SHOSHONE NATIONAL FOREST—Kelsee Hurshman stepped carefully into the shallows of subalpine Upper Brooks Lake high in the Absaroka Range. The lake bottom was muck, and the water looked nasty — pea soup colored, with a bunch of floating thingies. The green, detritus-filled cove was nothing a healthy person would think of drinking from, but a thirsty dog probably wouldn’t hesitate. And this is just what the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality employee from Cheyenne was looking for. The 9,100-foot-high backcountry basin has a history of harmful cyanobacterial — commonly called blue-green algae — blooms . Officials advised the public of a bloom , starting on Aug. 24. Wading in about a month later, Hurshman sought to see if the water contained enough cyanobacteria-associated toxins to warrant an additional advisory. “I’m collecting a few different samples,” said Hurshman, DEQ’s harmful cyanobacteria coordinator. Quickly and quietly, she bottled up the algae-choked water. The remnants of a potentially toxic cyanobacteria bloom linger in a cove of Upper Brooks Lake in September 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) It was Sept. 20, and Hurshman was sampling with a couple DEQ colleagues and Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber. The team logged the species of cyanobacteria present, where it was in the water column (the surface) and its color (green). Over the course of the day, they’d hike by all the named lakes in the small watershed pressed up against the Continental Divide: first, Brooks Lake, then Upper Brooks, Rainbow and Lower and Upper Jade lakes. Rimmed by Sublette Peak, the Breccia Cliffs and the Pinnacle Buttes, the stunning chain of lakes lies entirely in the national forest. They are remote, usually free from human presence and appear pristine. At a glance, one would never associate these picture-postcard-worthy high-altitude lakes with contamination. Yet they are dogged by nutrient problems and cyanobacteria blooms. “All of the named lakes have had blooms over advisory levels,” Gerber said, “and two of them have had toxins over advisory levels.” Many unknowns A mysterious environmental influence — or combination of factors — is believed to be triggering the blooms. There are theories, but DEQ employee Ron Steg, who leads the agency’s Lander office, is clear: There’s no saying exactly why cyanobacteria are striking this area every summer. “This particular watershed, the geology is high in phosphate,” Steg said. “It could be atmospheric deposition. We don’t know, and that’s why we are studying this.” Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber and Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffers Kelsee Hurshman, Ron Steg and Jillian Scott check out the shoreline of Brooks Lake Creek just below the outflow from Upper Brooks Lake. Although the water flows through a remote, wild, high-altitude landscape, the watershed is plagued by potentially harmful algal blooms. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) The DEQ is specifically examining what’s going on in the Brooks Lake watershed in detail because its 234-acre namesake lake has struggled with algal blooms that, on the worst occasions, have been implicated in fish kills so severe that fish went belly up miles downstream in the Wind River. Since 2018, Brooks Lake has occupied a slot on the Wyoming DEQ’s “impaired list.” At one time, fingers were pointed at Brooks Lake Lodge and its formerly surface-discharging sewage lagoon, but problems with nutrients and cyanobacterial blooms higher in the watershed have led to a more holistic investigation. The Brooks Lake watershed, however, isn’t the only place in Wyoming where people and their pets are finding harmful cyanobacteria blooms in unlikely places. Late last October, the Wyoming Department of Health issued a recreation advisory for the Wind River after a 10-pound puppy died within minutes of drinking flowing river water near the Upper Wind River Campground. Campers be forewarned: there are fall 2023 cyanobacteria toxin advisories in place for both the upper and lower Wind River campgrounds, plus in the Wind River immediately below Boysen Reservoir and two areas in the reservoir itself. “It sounded like the animal wasn’t taken to the vet because the dog died so quickly,” Lindsay Patterson, DEQ’s surface water quality standards coordinator, said of the 2022 puppy death. A species of cyanobacteria that resembles grass clippings floats in the water near the Brooks Lake boat ramp in September 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) Those types of fast-acting cyanobacteria dog deaths can happen when canines ingest chunks of “mat-forming blooms.” Water quality specialists don’t know if one of the harmful mats came off Boysen Reservoir, flowed past the dam and stayed intact enough to still be deadly when the puppy encountered it a mile downstream, or if the mat formed in the Wind River itself. Late summer and early fall are typically when cyanobacterial blooms are most likely to occur, but that’s not always the case. A daily must-read news update, for and by Wyoming . Subscribe for free!

In December of 2021, ice fisherman augering through a frozen-over Keyhole Reservoir came into a blue-green algae bloom. Three months later DEQ officials were still able to sample cyanobacteria in densities that exceeded the recreational standard. “We went back and looked at the satellite imagery from before and it looked really, really bad,” Hurshman said. “We suspect it may have persisted.” Then there’s the backcountry. Cyanobacteria blooms are often associated with abundances of nutrients, like fertilizer from agriculture, and warm water typically found at lower elevations. So why are blooms showing up in places like Togwotee Pass? Shoshone National Forest hydrologist Gwen Gerber leads Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffers Kelsee Hurshman, Ron Steg and Jillian Scott past Brooks Lake on the hike to Upper Brooks Lake, part of a years-long investigation into nutrient imbalances and seasonal algal blooms that plague the high-elevation watershed. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) Gerber, the Shoshone National Forest hydrologist, doesn’t have any firm answers, but she has noticed a trend within the 17 waterbodies on the national forest where cyanobacteria have been detected in high enough concentrations to warrant an advisory. All of them except for one, she said, are located in the Absaroka Volcanic formation — which suggests a component of the geology could be a contributing factor. Finding new hazards That’s not to say that potentially harmful blue-green algae blooms are restricted to those 17 lakes on the Shoshone National Forest. The hazard could be much more widespread, but documenting each instance with limited staff and time isn’t practical. “We can’t go to all the lakes every year,” Gerber said. This year Gerber went in to test three new lakes in the East Dunoir Creek watershed on the hunch that there might be blooms because lakes in an adjoining watershed — West Dunoir Creek — have had issues. “Two of those water bodies had blooms above advisory levels,” Gerber said. The DEQ’s website currently lists advisories for North and South Watkins lakes. Judging by the DEQ’s interactive advisory map alone, which is cataloged by year, known harmful cyanobacterial blooms are rapidly increasing in Wyoming waters. As recently as 2017 there were only three advisories in the entire state. By 2020 the list grew to 21 lakes statewide. Even after a long-lasting winter and cool spring — conditions that theoretically keep blooms at bay — there have already been 47 advisories posted so far in 2023. Cyanobacteria blooms in densities above advisory levels have been documented in all corners of Wyoming during 2023. (Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality) There’s evidence, however, that the increase is not strictly a symptom of environmental change. Increased reporting by a better-educated populace that now knows what to look for appears to be contributing to the rise in numbers. What might have just looked like a scummy pond in the yesteryear is now reported, sampled, tested and classified as a waterbody with a cyanobacterial bloom advisory. Anne’s Pond, for example, a tiny algae-choked feature on a hiking trail south of Jackson, now shows up with an advisory on the DEQ’s website. And an unnamed “Palmer Creek Trail Pond,” just a few miles away, is under investigation. Research backs up the claim that the increase in known cyanobacteria blooms is a product of looking harder and testing for it. The DEQ recently funded University of Wyoming research that evaluated 40 years of satellite imagery, including 200 lakes in Wyoming. “That study seems to indicate that we’re probably getting better at identifying blooms and there’s more awareness,” Patterson said, “rather than that we’re seeing a really large increase in the blooms.” Cyanotoxins, she said, were pretty much unknown to most people until Toledo, Ohio’s drinking water was affected in 2014. “At water quality management agencies, some people were doing some monitoring here and there,” Patterson said. “But it was not like the robust programs that you see now.” Scaling up That holds true for the Wyoming DEQ. Hurshman’s position didn’t exist until around 2018, and it’s become progressively more focused on harmful cyanobacteria monitoring , Patterson said. In 2021 the agency began a routine monitoring program that prioritizes water where people tend to recreate, and where blooms are most likely to produce toxins. This year they brought on an intern also devoted to the monitoring cause. Hurshman also conducts routine satellite monitoring of 40 of the state’s lakes and reservoirs, which allows her to track the seasonal evolution of blooms — and feed data into the interagency Cyanobacteria Assessment Network . The gloved hand of Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality staffer Kelsee Hurshman, the agency’s harmful cyanobacteria program coordinator, grasps a bottle full of algae-choked water extracted from Upper Brooks Lake on the Shoshone National Forest. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) “It’s been a major priority for us,” Patterson said of cyanobacteria monitoring. “In Wyoming, I think we now have a better idea of where [blooms] are, and which ones are producing toxins. But we do have to make choices in how we’re allocating resources.” Many smaller backcountry Wyoming lakes prone to harmful cyanobacteria blooms will likely never be sampled every summer — or perhaps even ever. But others, like those in the chain of lakes where Hurshman hiked north of Togwotee Pass, are likely to be monitored annually and even be subject to special studies. There, the intensive effort is a result of Brooks Lake’s impaired classification in the Wyoming DEQ’s 305B and 303D report , which is required by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Water Act. Brooks Lakes’ impairment is listed as “not fully supporting” its fishery and other aquatic life due to an abundance of nutrients and elevated pH. DEQ officials, in turn, are trying to understand what, if anything, they can do to improve the water quality. To that end, DEQ employees Tavis Eddy and Val Shao pumped up packrafts to float out and measure for temperature, pH and other parameters a half mile up the trail from Upper Brooks Lake at Rainbow Lake back on Sept. 20. The boat-borne data collection was part of a three-year-long intensive monitoring effort that’s not yet completed. Eventually, the data they gather could help explain the factors plaguing the Brooks Lake system. Val Shao, a water technician for the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, paddles a packraft toward the center of Rainbow Lake to conduct tests with Tavis Eddy, an environmental scientist with DEQ’s water quality program. The DEQ has monitored Rainbow Lake and other portions of the Brooks Lake watershed for several years to help determine what’s been causing nutrient-driven algal blooms. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile) But in the meantime, scientists like Steg hesitate to hazard a guess as to what exactly is going on. “The whole purpose of what we’re doing here is to determine the causes and sources [of nutrients],” he said. “Another year and hopefully we’ll have some real data and can come up with some real answers.” Some answers will come sooner, like whether Upper Brooks Lake and other reaches of the watershed are dangerous to people’s pets this fall. The cyanotoxin lab results are already in. Hurshman’s samples from Upper Brooks Lake did not exceed the toxin threshold, but the water she gathered at Rainbow Lake did.

Reply Fred Maguire says: October 6, 2023 at 9:19 am Just curious.  Would all the backcountry water treatment methods effectively neutralize these toxins and bacteria?  Steri-Pen, filtration, boiling, chemicals?? Reply Christine Joab says: October 7, 2023 at 10:34 am The short answer is no. Filters and chemicals can kill the cyanobacteria but they don’t filter out the toxins, which is what you need to be worried about.

Comments are due by October 30, 2023 and may be emailed to mattamuskeet@fws.gov or mailed to Mattamuskeet NWR, 85 Mattamuskeet Rd, Swan Quarter, NC 27885. Over the past decade, Lake Mattamuskeet has experienced declines in water quality, transitioning from a lake dominated by dense grass beds to one dominated by microscopic blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria. Fueled by excess nutrients, these cyanobacteria, along with the high levels of suspended sediments in the lake, block sunlight and prevent growth of submerged grasses that are very beneficial to fish and wildlife. In 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was approached by the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences and BlueGreen Water Technologies who had identified Lake Mattamuskeet as a potential study site for a trial treatment of cyanobacteria. After several discussions and field visits with the project team and state partners, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service produced a draft Environmental Assessment for the proposed cyanobacteria treatment on Lake Mattamuskeet. In an effort to provide more concise information to the public, USFWS has developed an information sheet regarding the proposed treatment. Proposed Cyanobacteria Treatment Information Sheet The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announces the availability of this draft Environmental Assessment and is seeking comments from the public on the proposed action.  Copies can be accessed at the refuge office or online at the button below. Draft Environmental Assessment Comments are due by October 30, 2023 and may be emailed to mattamuskeet@fws.gov or mailed to Mattamuskeet NWR, 85 Mattamuskeet Rd, Swan Quarter, NC 27885.

Swimming is banned for people and pets, according to the Oregon Health Authority, just as Portlanders need to cool off. By Katherine Chew Hamilton August 16, 2023 A cyanobacteria bloom Image: Cheng Wei/shutterstock.com Update 8/16/23: Cyanobacteria has quickly bloomed across the entire downtown swath of the Willamette River. According to an advisory issued on August 15 by the Oregon Health Authority, the affected span runs from the Ross Island Lagoon northward (that’s downstream) to Cathedral Park. That area includes Cottonwood Bay Park, Willamette Park, and Poet’s Beach, as well as the popular swimming areas at Duckworth Dock and Cathedral Park. The OHA emphasizes that in the affected areas, people and pets are advised to stay dry and not drink the water, because water ingestion is the primary route of exposure (not skin contact). Other activities are safe, including catch-and-release fishing, camping, hiking, biking, picnicking, bird-watching, canoeing, and kayaking. Boating is safe as long as speeds do not create excessive water spray, which can lead to inhaling cyanotoxins. OHA water sample testing will continue this week. Now is prime time for plunging into Oregon’s rivers, lakes, and swimming holes . But you (and your dog) might want to look before you leap. The Oregon Health Authority issued advisories for cyanobacteria blooms in four bodies of water in the Portland area. “Pets are who we’re most concerned about,” says David Farrer, a toxicologist for the Oregon Health Authority. “We’ve never had any people that we know of die from exposure to one of these blooms, but we have had a lot of animals die from these blooms, especially dogs, sometimes livestock.” Blooms can look like blue or blue-green paint, thick like pea soup, or foamy and reddish brown, like the photos here . As of August 2, affected areas near Portland include Aarons Lake, Pete’s Slough, and Sturgeon Lake on Sauvie Island , as well as the Willamette River near Willamette Cove . Near Vancouver, WA, advisories have also been issued for Lacamas Lake and Vancouver Lake. These warnings counsel against swimming and drinking the water, even with filtering. High-speed boating is also not recommended, due to spray that leads to inhalation. Eating fish from these waters is also ill-advised. Cyanobacteria blooms, which are often colloquially referred to as “algae” blooms aren’t really algae, according to OHA . Cyanobacteria naturally occur in bodies of fresh water worldwide, but when they bloom en masse, they sometimes produce high levels of cyanotoxins, like microcystins and cylindrospermopsin. When ingested, they can produce red rashes on the skin, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea and diarrhea for up to 72 hours. For dogs, ingesting cyanotoxins can even be deadly . Summer and early fall are the peak seasons for cyanobacteria blooms (they happened last August, too , and every previous year since monitoring began ). Sunlight and warm water temperatures help the bacteria thrive, as do nutrients from human activity like fertilizer and waste. Climate change and high population density also contribute to the increasing frequency of algae blooms. You’re more likely to find them in shallow, warm, and still bodies of water—which, Farrer notes, can also include backyard ponds or livestock troughs. It’s impossible to tell whether a bloom is toxic just by looking at it, and not all bodies of water are regularly tested for cyanotoxins. Thus, experts say to avoid bodies of water with visible cyanobacteria blooms. You can check out a complete list of Oregon advisories here , and Washington advisories here .

Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) is the name given to excessive growth of cyanobacteria  which  occurs under suitable  conditions (light temperature, nutrients, and calm water), which can produce  a thick brown or green mat-like layer on the water. Some HABs  can produce highly potent toxins, known as cyanotoxins.  Cyanotoxins are produced and contained within the cyanobacterial cells  (intracellular) and have adverse health effects.  The release of these toxins in an algal bloom into the surrounding water  occurs mostly during cell death and lysis (i.e., cell rupture). Cyanotoxins  can have adverse health effects.  Recreational Waters and Drinking Water sources can both be impacted by Harmful  Algal Blooms and should be monitored for signs of a bloom. Water  systems with surface water supplies tend to be  the most vulnerable, but certain groundwater sources,  such as those identified as being under the direct influence of surface water  (GWUDI) may also be susceptible to HABs. Historically,  algal blooms have been known risks for public water systems due to the taste  and odor effects they can have on water supplies. More recently, the degree to  which cyanotoxins can enter drinking water supplies has been better understood  and requires further attention than they were previously given. Due to  the possible lysing of cyanobacteria, and the subsequent release of cyanotoxins  in certain conventional treatment processes, some systems may experience  difficulty in addressing these compounds. Therefore, it is recommended that  systems become familiar with risks to their own source water and begin the  planning process to address HABs if they occur. If you suspect a water body to be experiencing an HAB,  particularly if it is a drinking water source, report it to the DEP Hotline  (1-877-WARNDEP(927-6337)) or download the WARN  NJDEP mobile app from iTunes, Google Play or Windows Phone. These are the  only means of notifying DEP of a suspected HAB. For more information about  identifying HABs, view the Department’s central web page on HABs at www.state.nj.us/dep/hab/ .

Despite their aridity, they are often inhabited by diverse microscopic communities of cyanobacteria. These organisms are commonly found in lithic habitats, where they are partially sheltered from extremes of temperature and UV radiation. However, living under the rock surface imposes additional constraints, such as limited light availability, and enrichment of longer wavelengths than are typically usable for oxygenic photosynthesis. Some cyanobacteria from the genus Chroococcidiopsis can use this light to photosynthesize, in a process known as far-red light photoacclimation, or FaRLiP. This genus has commonly been reported from both hot and cold deserts. However, not all Chroococcidiopsis strains carry FaRLiP genes, thus motivating our study into the interplay between FaRLiP and extreme lithic environments. The abundance of sequence data and strains provided the necessary material for an in-depth phylogenetic study, involving spectroscopy, microscopy, and determination of pigment composition, as well as gene and genome analyses. Pigment analyses revealed the presence of red-shifted chlorophylls d and f in all FaRLiP strains tested. In addition, eight genus-level taxa were defined within the encompassing Chroococcidiopsidales , clarifying the phylogeny of this long-standing polyphyletic order. FaRLiP is near universally present in a generalist genus identified in a wide variety of environments, Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto , while it is rare or absent in closely related, extremophile taxa, including those preferentially inhabiting deserts. This likely reflects the evolutionary process of gene loss in specialist lineages.

Among bacteria, the oxygenic photosynthetic cyanobacteria have diversified to occupy numerous niches by synthesizing specific pigments, forming biofilms, or fixing atmospheric nitrogen [ 1 , 2 ]. Early colonizing cyanobacteria are often the most significant carbon inputs in extreme, nutrient-poor environments, including deserts [ 3 , 4 ]. Defined in this work as (hyper-)arid environments (Aridity Index <0.2, or Potential Evapotranspiration <400 mm for cold deserts) [ 5 ], they encompass places as varied as the Atacama Desert and University Valley in Antarctica, and are often subject to additional stresses, such as high or low temperatures, large daily temperature variations, ice crystal nucleation, and intense solar radiation [ 4 ]. For this reason, many desert cyanobacteria colonize the subsurface or the interior of rocks [ 4 , 6 , 7 ]. A microorganism commonly inhabiting deserts is the cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis . This genus is characterized by non-motile solitary spherical cells forming non-polarized agglomerations, and the ability to reproduce by non-motile baeocytes [ 8 , 9 ]. It has been isolated from cold and hot deserts, hot springs, and spacecraft assembly clean rooms [ 7 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ], with some isolates even surviving space [ 17 , 18 ]. Previous studies have highlighted extreme temperature tolerance as a lineage-specific trait, with different lineages characteristic of hot or cold deserts, respectively [ 15 , 19 ]. Nevertheless, strains have also been found in seemingly moderate environments [ 12 , 20 , 21 ]. This environmental diversity, combined with the large number of strains available from culture collections, make Chroococcidiopsis an ideal test subject for the study of adaptations to extreme environments. It has become clear that at least some members of the Chroococcidiopsis genus can also thrive in the absence of visible light, for instance in soil, biofilms, or within sedimentary rocks, by using far-red light / near-infrared radiation (~700–750 nm) [ 16 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 ]. In order to do so, they undergo a process called far-red light photoacclimation (FaRLiP). This involves the extensive remodeling of the photosynthetic apparatus and the synthesis of new pigments, namely chlorophyll f , as well as traces (<1%) of chlorophyll d [ 23 , 27 , 28 ]. The significance of chlorophyll d in particular is an unsolved puzzle, as some studies locate it in the reaction center of far-red Photosystem II [ 23 , 29 ], yet many strains appear to lack it altogether [ 21 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ]. In addition, FaRLiP relies on a 20-gene cluster encoding paralogues of Photosystem I, Photosystem II and phycobilisome components, as well as a phytochrome regulatory cascade [ 24 ]. It is present in a small but diverse range of cyanobacteria, and is mainly associated with shading by other photosynthetic organisms [ 22 , 24 ]. However, certain types of rock such as quartz may create similar microenvironments through the preferential transmission of longer wavelengths [ 6 , 16 ]. As desert Chroococcidiopsis strains have been frequently isolated from lithic habitats, they might provide models for understanding not only the evolution of far-red light photoacclimation, but also its role in the environment. Some Chroococcidiopsis lineages are either hot or cold desert specialists [ 15 , 19 ]. Other strains from moderate environments might be generalists, based on the wide spread of this genus [ 12 , 20 ]. Comparing their FaRLiP capacities could highlight selective pressures and constraints for the habitat. Nevertheless, recent research casts doubt on taxonomically assigning certain extremophilic lineages to the same genus. For example, the lineage known as “Cold Desert Chroococcidiopsis ” has recently been typified as the separate genus Aliterella [ 35 ]. Still, there is strong evidence of FaRLiP being present in the last common ancestor of Chroococcidiopsidales (the order containing Chroococcidiopsis ), thereby motivating our research [ 22 , 36 ]. Traditionally, many related strains have been intermixed and simplified as “ Chroococcidiopsis ”. Recent research has been addressing this topic, but an overarching view that combines fine-scale 16S rRNA gene, genomic and ecological data is still missing [ 37 , 38 , 39 , 40 ]. The availability of cultured strains sampled from all over the world, together with the recent expansion in sequencing data, including metadata and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), enabled this investigation. Therefore, this work presents a fine-grained evolutionary history of far-red light photoacclimation within the genus Chroococcidiopsis , and reveals a stark contrast in FaRLiP maintenance in generalist versus specialist taxa. In the process, this work also clarifies phylogenetic relationships within this genus and its associated order. Materials and methods Cyanobacterial strains and cultivation The 43 cyanobacterial strains were obtained from the culture collections PCC, SAG, CCALA, CCMEE, and BCCM/ULC (Table S1 ). The last two provided the extremophilic strains. All strains were grown in BG11 [ 9 ] at room temperature, apart from Antarctic BCCM/ULC strains (10 °C). Far-red light incubators used LEDs centered at 750 nm (LED750-03AU, Roithner). Cultures were grown in parallel under white light. The photon flux ranged between 10 and 30 μmol photons m –2 s –1 . Fluorescence microscopy and spectra In order to investigate photosynthetic acclimation, fluorescence images and spectral scans of cyanobacterial samples were acquired with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM; Leica SP8) using a HC PL APO x63/1.40 oil CS2 objective. Strains were grown for more than 20 days under FRL, immobilized onto BG11 medium containing 1% agar (w/v) and excited at 488 nm. Fluorescence images were taken by detecting the emission from phycobilisomes and chlorophyll a at 660–700 nm and from chlorophyll f at 720–750 nm. CLSM lambda-scans were obtained by collecting the emission from 550 to 800 nm with 3 nm steps and 5 nm bandwidth. Images were analyzed with Leica LAS X (version 3.5.6) and FIJI [ 41 ]. Spectral analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook (version 6) running Python 3. Pigment analysis Pigments were extracted and analyzed by HPLC using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. Samples were run on a Supelco Discovery HS C18 column (5 μm particle size, 120 Å pore size, 250 × 4.6 mm) at 1 ml·min –1 and 40 ˚C. Solvent A was 64:16:20 (v/v/v) methanol:acetone:H 2 O, while solvent B was 80:20 (v/v) methanol:acetone. Solvent B was held at 50% for the first 2 min, increased linearly to 100% over 10 min, and was held there for 25 min. Elution of chlorophylls a , d , and f was detected by monitoring absorbance at 665, 696, and 705 nm, respectively. DNA extraction and quantification Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted using Quick-DNA Fungal/Bacterial Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research), with a longer bead-beating time (20 min). DNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop spectrometer or a Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Amplification of marker genes The ability of strains for FaRLiP was assessed by amplifying the far-red specific marker gene apcE2 by PCR from genomic DNA. This has been previously shown to be a simple, reliable assay in a wide variety of species [ 22 , 42 ]. Two additional primer sets were used for the amplification of 16S rRNA gene and for the hypervariable intergenic sequence (ITS) between the 16S and 23 S rRNA genes. The PCR and extraction protocol used was the same as published before, with 25 ng gDNA per 25 µl reaction [ 22 ]. The amplicons obtained were sequenced (Microsynth Seqlab). For apcE2 amplicons in particular, 5ʹ tags were used as sequencing primers. All primers are listed in the Supplementary Material (Table S2) . Single-gene phylogenies and rooting In addition to the amplicons obtained above, 16S rRNA and apcE2 gene sequences were also recovered from NCBI [ 43 , 44 ]. Search settings for apcE2 : BLASTp (nr database) and tBLASTn (WGS database, “cyanobacteria”). Search settings for 16S rRNA genes: BLASTn, nr, 1000 results. Query: 16S rRNA of Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203. Sequences were aligned with MAFFT using Jalview [ 45 , 46 ]. Phylogenies were built with RaxML on the CIPRES webserver [ 47 , 48 ]. Settings: RAxML-HPC2 on XSEDE, model GTR CAT, bootstrap iterations 100. Trees were edited with iTOL [ 49 ] and Inkscape 0.92. For the graphical abstract, BioRender was used. Networks were built with Splitstree for alternative visualization [ 50 ]. Large branches with uncertain labels (e.g. “uncultured bacterium”), or outside the scope of this study, were removed. So were 16 rRNA genes showing high similarity to Chroococcidiopsis sequences, and assumed to be close relatives in previous work [ 38 ], but revealed by genome phylogenies to be distantly related [ 36 ]. “ Chroococcidiopsis ” sequences belonging to different orders were also largely filtered out (Table S8 ). Additional divergent sequences, including partial sequences (700 nt) were recovered through BLAST searches, for a total alignment length of 1284 ± 169 bp. For the apcE2 phylogeny, the root point was confirmed with Minimal Ancestral Deviation (MAD) [ 51 ] and previous work [ 22 ]. For the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny, rooting was done with Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327 as an outgroup. This strain is capable of FaRLiP, and branches out from just outside the group containing the Chroococcidiopsidales together with their closest relatives, the Nostocales [ 24 , 36 ]. Except for the position of the Nostocales as an artifact in 16S rRNA gene trees, the branching pattern closely mirrored the genome tree and was therefore regarded as overall more accurate [ 36 ]. Using either Nostocales or Gloeobacter as an outgroup significantly changed this branching pattern, and was therefore considered less accurate. Previous work also shows this branching instability [ 15 , 35 , 37 , 38 , 52 ]. Sequence comparison of 16S rRNA genes Simple sequence similarity can be a useful phylogenetic proxy. The 16S rRNA genes were aligned with MUSCLE in a ClustalW format [ 53 ]. The output was submitted to Clustal Omega in order to generate a percentage identity matrix (PIM) [ 54 ]. The matrix was parsed and statistics calculated with Python 3.7 using PyCharm (modules: pandas, statistics) [ 55 ]. RNA structure prediction D1-D1’ and Box B loop structures from the ITS were predicted by running SPOT-RNA on a Linux server [ 56 ]. This included non-canonical base pairs/pseudoknots stabilized by tertiary interactions. Results were cross-checked with Mfold and RNA-fold [ 57 , 58 ]. Genome data sourcing: sequencing and assembly Based on their phylogenetic position, Chroococcidiopsis sp. SAG 39.79, SAG 2023, SAG 2025, and Chroococcopsis gigantea SAG 12.99 were sequenced using Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (Table S3 ). Samples were sequenced according to vendor protocols on a MiSeq and MinION (MinKNOW version 1.10.23), the former using Nextera XT v2 and the latter a R9.4.1 flowcell with base-calling via Albacore (version 2.1.7). In addition to these samples, a metagenomic dataset from the Atacama Desert (NCBI codes SRR2394720 and SRR2396013), associated with ignimbrite rock, was reassembled. Its sourcing is described in the following section. Trimming and quality control was performed with BBDuk (settings: qtrim=r trimq=10 minlen=30 ktrim=r k = 23 mink=11 hdist=1 tpe tbo) [ 59 ]. Assembly was executed for each individual sample with MEGAHIT (settings: meta-sensitive, paired) [ 60 ] for the metagenome, and the hybrid assembler Unicycler for the cultured strains [ 61 ]. Samples were co-binned with vamb [ 62 ]. CheckM, Prokka, and the BBMap statswrapper module were used to estimate bin quality after refinement with anvi’o [ 59 , 63 , 64 , 65 ]. The SAG 39.79 assembly was further improved with LongStitch (settings: tigmint-ntLink-arks) [ 66 ]. Genome-level analyses Besides the locally sequenced samples, genomes were recovered by genus name, as well as by BLAST searches [ 43 ]. For clades with little to no representation, four additional metagenome bins were obtained: “ignimbrite12”, “ignimbrite01”, “Atacama+Negev” and “mojave”. The first two are associated with samples from the Atacama Desert (Fig. S3 ) [ 67 ]. Their raw data was shown to contain apcE2 fragments corresponding to Chroococcidiopsidales in a previous study using SearchSRA for data mining [ 22 , 68 ]. Bin “Atacama+Negev” was identified from the literature as Chroococcidiopsis [ 16 ], and confirmed with a genome tree. It is representative for three near-identical FaRLiP endolithic bins from the Atacama and Negev deserts (IMG/MER bin used 3300037877_1; similar bins 3300039401_1 and 3300039404_1) [ 16 ]. Bin ‘mojave’ was originally sampled from the Mojave desert, and recovered with IMG/MER’s 16S rRNA-based BLAST search (original IMG/MER bin ID 3300034134_4; permission granted by Kirsten Fisher from California State University, USA) [ 69 ]. The genome phylogeny was built with OrthoFinder, and included 13 strains which belong to the Chroococcidiopsidales [ 70 ]. Orthofinder uses proteome inputs; where not already available, these were obtained from genomic sequences with Prokka [ 65 ]. Despite the different genus name, both the 16S rRNA gene and the genome labeled Scytonema millei VB511283 (JTJC00000000.3) clustered with Chroococcidiopsis strains. To identify clade-specific genes, the genomes and metagenome bins were submitted to OrthoVenn2 [ 71 ]. Datasets chosen as representatives for their respective clades: Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203, Gloeocapsa sp. PCC 7428, Aliterella atlantica CENA595, the original ignimbrite12 metagenome, the mislabeled Scytonema millei VB511283, Chroococcidiopsis sp. CCALA 051, Chroococcales cyanobacterium IPPAS B-1203, Mojave metagenome. As ignimbrite12 was the only representative of its clade, clade-specific genes were approximated by dataset-specific genes. Default settings. The orthologue sets recovered were submitted to BlastKOALA and KofamKOALA on the KEGG webserver [ 72 , 73 ], with KEGG Mapper enabling a better understanding of genus-specific functional pathways [ 74 ]. Environment classification Desert environments were classified into hot and cold depending on the main reason for their aridity: evaporation or low temperatures, respectively [ 5 ]. This has been typically used in cyanobacterial work [ 15 ]. Equivalents in the Köppen–Geiger climatic scheme: Bwh for hot deserts, and ET (polar or alpine) for cold deserts [ 75 ]. For the purposes of this study, the mild Atacama Desert was considered ‘hot’. In addition, a subset of hot deserts with large seasonal variations, where average monthly temperatures might drop below 0° C, were additionally labeled “hot-and-cold” [ 76 ]. This category also included sampling sites from unspecified deserts. For 16S rRNA genes, all NCBI metadata was considered, together with citing literature when necessary / available. Results and discussion Red-shifted chlorophylls d and f are extensively present in the genus Chroococcidiopsis A broad range of 43 samples labeled as Chroococcidiopsis were obtained from culture collections. These strains are representative of either non-extreme environments (19) or deserts (20 from hot deserts, 4 from cold deserts) (Table S1 ). The strains were tested for their ability the perform FaRLiP by using a combination of molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical methods. A first screening approach was performed by PCR for the FaRLiP marker gene apcE2 (Table S2 ). This gene has always and exclusively been found co-occurring with chlF ( psbA4 ), the gene encoding the chlorophyll f synthase [ 22 ]. Out of the 43 tested strains, 22 were positive for the presence of apcE2 . A phylogenetic tree was built with the amino acid sequences encoded by these 22 apcE2 genes, together with homologs recovered from the NCBI. The ApcE2 phylogeny is split into two main branches (Fig. 1A : I and II). The majority of sequences fall in group I, and are associated with a narrow definition of Chroococcidiopsis around the type strain Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 (hereafter referred to as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto ). These strains have been largely sampled from non-extreme environments (Fig. 1B ). However, sequences for “ Chroococcidiopsis’ CCMEE 10, CCMEE 130, and ignimbrite12 (a metagenomics sequence from ignimbrite rock in the Atacama Desert) are clearly divergent from the others (Fig. 1A : II). These strains have been sampled from hot deserts and appear to belong to a different genus, yet to be defined. Fig. 1: Distribution of FaRLiP in the order Chroococcidiopsidales . A Phylogeny of ApcE2 marker sequences from Chroococcidopsis strains, or strains previously classified as such. Bullet points mark full-length proteins. There is a clear split between two branches, I and II, with the largest one (I) associated with Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto . Type species Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 is listed in bold. B Distribution of FaRLiP in the genus Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I). The 16S rRNA gene phylogeny includes strains which tested positive for apcE2 and/or strains with a known FaRLiP cluster (red). Most of them also survived under far-red light, except for a minority of non-axenic strains (CCALA 44, 47, 51, 52, 927). One strain tested negative for apcE2 and did not survive under FRL (black square). HPLC data showed the presence of chlorophylls d and f (circles) or only chlorophyll f , as reported in previous studies (triangles). Trees built with RaxML. Bootstrap values < 30 not shown. Full size image The ApcE2 phylogeny (Fig. 1A ) matches the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 1B ), the genome tree discussed later, as well as a higher-resolution Chroococcidiopsis tree based on MALDI-TOF data [ 20 ]. These results are consistent with vertical descent driving the distribution of FaRLiP within this genus, as opposed to horizontal gene transfer as has previously been suggested for this phenotype [ 24 ]. As the apcE2 gene is an indirect, though fast marker for FaRLiP [ 22 ], additional methods were used to assess the cellular response. These included monitoring the long-term survival of the strains under far-red light (as judged by pigmentation), recording fluorescence emission spectra and determining pigment composition by HPLC. Out of the 22 apcE2 -positive strains, 18 strains were selected for further analyses as representative of phylogenetic and environmental variation. Out of these, 13 strains survived in far-red light (Table S1 ). They included 11 strains from group I and 2 from group II. The remaining 5 cultures (group I) showed abundant non-cyanobacterial growth, which likely outcompeted the cyanobacteria under the test conditions. FaRLiP is a slow process, taking 12-14 days for full acclimation, during which cyanobacteria do not grow [ 77 ]. None of the 8 apcE2 -negative strains tested survived these conditions. To accurately distinguish the FaRLiP cyanobacterial cells from contaminants on a single-cell level, we recorded fluorescence emission spectra using confocal microscopy. All strains surviving in far-red light showed emission peaks that indicated the presence of red-shifted chlorophylls in the photosystems (Fig. 2 , or S1 for full results). The chlorophylls involved extend the emission range to 720–750 nm, in addition to the commonly found fluorescence attributed to chlorophyll a and phycobilisomes in the range of 640–700 nm at room temperature. This response is specific to far-red light and it does not occur under standard, white-light conditions [ 24 ]. As confocal microscopy is unable to identify the specific pigments, HPLC analysis was performed on a subset of 9 strains from groups I and II that were phylogenetically representative and exhibited low contamination levels. Fig. 2: Far-Red Light Photoacclimation in the Chroococcidiopsidales . The synthesis of red-shifted chlorophylls and their incorporation into photosystems can be seen in confocal micrographs (left). In addition to florescence emission from chlorophyll a and phycobilisomes (magenta, 660–700 nm), there is emission from chlorophyll f (yellow, 720–750 nm). Rightmost micrographs mark the overlay of both channels. Excitation, 488 nm. Scale bar, 10 µm. Spectral characteristics can be also observed through a fluorescence emission scan, with the aforementioned channels highlighted (second column from the right). Y-axis: Intensity (a.u.). Composite graph for a minimum of 3 cells. Pigments were extracted and analyzed by HPLC (right). Absorbance traces at 696 nm are shown, indicating the presence of chlorophyll d (16.3 min), f (16.7 min) and a (19.0 min). Full size image All of the HPLC-tested strains contained chlorophylls a , d , and f when cultured under far-red light (Fig. 2 , Table S1 ). Chromatogram peaks were visually consistent with the published percentages of approx. 90% chl a , 9% chl f and 1% chl d of the chlorophyll content [ 24 ]. Chlorophylls d and f were always observed in HPLC data for samples that showed a red-shifted fluorescence peak under far-red light, and these peaks were always observed for samples containing these red-shifted chlorophylls (Fig. 2 ). It has been shown that chlorophyll f is essential for FaRLiP [ 24 ], and the trace pigment chlorophyll d has been reported from the majority of strains undergoing this process [ 27 ]. However, the literature is divided on the significance of the latter. Some strains appear to lack chlorophyll d [ 21 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 ], including Chroococcidiopsis strains from a subtropical forest [ 21 ]. These strains are 98.2-100% similar in 16S rRNA sequence to ours [ 21 , 23 ]. All of our phylogenetically diverse samples contained chlorophyll d (Fig. 1B ). This is consistent with previous studies indicating that Photosystem II (PSII) from far-red grown FaRLiP cyanobacteria contain a single chlorophyll d pigment in the reaction center, including in the type strain Chroococcidiopsis thermalis PCC 7203 [ 23 , 29 ]. Since the amount of PSII per cell is known to vary depending on growth conditions [ 78 ], the detection of chlorophyll d might thus be more difficult under certain conditions and explain its apparent absence in some cases. Therefore, we suggest that having one chlorophyll d per PSII may be a conserved attribute of all FaRLiP strains. Future studies could consider growth phase in their chlorophyll d pigment analyses. Overall, it is clear that the capacity for FaRLiP is correlated with the phylogenetic lineage. Specifically, within Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), all but one of 24 strains (96%), tested positive for chlorophyll f synthesis via multiple methods (marker gene presence, confocal microscopy, HPLC) (Fig. 1 ). In contrast, in lineage II, the majority of strains (18, or 73%) tested negative for chlorophyll f (Fig. S2 ). Out of 24 desert strains tested, only 3 were positive, belonging to lineage II. This seemingly contradicted our initial expectation that extreme endolithic environments would be enriched in FaRLiP cyanobacteria. Therefore, in order to investigate the connection between FaRLiP and habitat, and whether this is influenced by phylogenetic history, we set out to understand phylogenetic groupings within the Chroococcidiopsidales , and the adaptive niches they may be associated with. Improved phylogeny of the order Chroococcidiopsidales Triggered by the observed divergence in the ApcE2 tree (Fig. 1A ), a 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 3 ) and a sequence similarity network (Fig. S3 ) were built to better understand the evolutionary history of the order Chroococcidiopsidales . Trees based on 16S rRNA genes carry limited phylogenetic information and are therefore prone to issues such as unreliable branching patterns, polyphyly, and/or mislabeling. In contrast to them, genome-level phylogenies are less sensitive to noise, but full genomes are available for far fewer strains [ 36 , 40 ]. This study took advantage of both methods, by building a genome phylogeny (Fig. 3B ) and using it to correct and interpret the 16S rRNA gene phylogeny (Fig. 3A ). Fig. 3: Phylogenetic history of the Chroococcidiopsidales order. Phylogenetic trees of the Chroococcidiopsidales order based on 16S rRNA genes ( A ) and genome information ( B ). The two trees mirror and complement each other. In ( A ), it can be seen that the genus ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’ is currently polyphyletic. Strains identified as such actually belong to multiple clades, some of which may be highly supported, but whose relationships with each other is sometimes unclear. Large, highly supported clades and/or clades with type species have been collapsed. Each color represents a genus-level taxon, some with associated genome information ( B ). These taxa include well-defined genera such as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), Sinocapsa (IV), Aliterella (VI), Haliplanktos (VII) and Pseudocyanosarcina (VIII). They also encompass yet-undefined genera lacking a type species—Hot desert Chroococcidiopsi dales (II) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V). Moreover, ‘ Gloeocapsa ’ (III) represents a cluster of taxonomically ambiguous, closely related strains ( Gloeocapsa , Gloeocapsopsis , Chroogloeocystis and Speleotes ). Although showing low support in this tree, the Sinocapsa (IV) branch is stable across multiple tree-building methods. The related Nostocales are indicated by a gray rectangle (see “Materials and Methods”: Single-gene phylogenies and rooting). The tree was rooted with Pleurocapsa sp. PCC 7327, another FaRLiP strain, as an outgroup. Full size image The resulting Chroococcidiopsidales genome tree covered a diversity of lineages, by combining publicly available NCBI data (12 genomes), metagenome bins (3) and locally sequenced strains (2). Of the latter, Chroococcidiopsis sp. SAG 2025 was sequenced to the level of a complete, circularized genome (Table S3 ). Combining our trees with other recent work, showed six highly supported clades (III-VIII) besides the two already mentioned (I-II) (Fig. 3 ; See Figs. S2 , S4 – S8 for individual trees) [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]. These include five genera, such as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I), Sinocapsa (IV), Aliterella (previously ‘Cold desert Chroococcidiopsis ’) (VI), Haliplanktos (VII) Pseudocyanosarcina (VIII), and the two additional taxa ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales ’ (previously ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsis ’) (II) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V). One extra clade is represented by a monophyletic cluster of genera related to Gloeocapsa (III), with >95% similarity between 16S rRNA gene sequences. Because the taxonomy of Gloeocapsa -related strains requires revision (Fig. S4 ), for the purposes of this paper they will be discussed together. All of these clades, including those yet to be described, are likely equivalent to genera. This can be seen from 16S rRNA gene similarities (>95% within clades) (Table S4 ) [ 79 ], from the shape of D1-D1’ (Fig. S9 ) and Box-B loops of the rRNA operon’s hypervariable region (Fig. S10 ), from shared genes (Fig. S11 ), as well as metadata. For ease of cross-referencing, names used in previous publications were collated (Table S5 ). Although it was noted as a possibility from an early landmark paper [ 80 ], polyphyly within Chroococcidiopsis has been insufficiently acknowledged in the literature [ 15 , 19 ]. This can lead to biased assumptions in comparative microbiological studies, which can propagate through later research. For example, a model organism used for cryo-EM studies of Photosystem I is Chroococcidiopsis sp. TS-821 [ 81 ], which we show actually belongs to ‘Gloeocapsa’ (III) (Fig. 3 ). Awareness of ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’ diversity grew in recent years through the introduction of genera such as Aliterella and Sinocapsa [ 35 , 37 , 38 , 39 ]. Our work highlights two additional genus-level clades (II and V) which have been commonly mislabeled as ‘ Chroococcidiopsis ’. The present phylogeny considers all the data available (16S rRNA genes, genomes, MAGs) to produce a state-of-the-art understanding of evolutionary relationships within the Chroococcidiopsidales , and assist further research on this order. FaRLiP within the Chroococcidiopsidales is common to generalists, not specialists By recovering sampling location data, many clades could be associated with particular (micro)environments, and were therefore defined as ‘specialists’ (Fig. 4 ). The majority of strains in specialist clades do not appear to have FaRLiP, indicative of gene loss. FaRLiP-lacking clades include ‘ Gloeocapsa ’ (III), which is strongly associated with hot spring or saline environments (Supplementary Text 1 ), and Aliterella (VI) which appears linked to cold deserts, such as polar and alpine regions (Supplementary Text 2 ). Fig. 4: Environmental preferences within Chroococcidiopsidales lineages. This figure considers the temperature/humidity of the original sampling sites (inside row), as well as the capacity to utilize far-red light (outside row). Lineages are listed on the tree branches. Lineage II appears to be highly specialized to living in hot deserts. In contrast, Aliterella (VI) sequences have often found in cold deserts. Gloeocapsa and related strains (III) are characteristic of hot springs, while Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I) appears to have a wider distribution. Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto is the largest of the clades recovered, and it is strongly associated with the ability to perform FaRLiP. FaRLiP capacity was assessed by combining experimental and genome data. Strains listed as positive survived under far-red light and / or carried the entire FaRLiP gene cluster. Negative strains did not survive under far-red light, failing the apcE2 PCR assay, and / or lacked the gene within a complete genome. Tree built with RaxML. An extended version with labels can be accessed at https://itol.embl.de/tree/1301336668200071662129117 . Full size image In specialist lineage II, only 3 out of the 18 tested strains proved capable of FaRLiP. We defined this clade as ‘Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales ’. Out of 35 available 16S rRNA gene sequences, 33 were recovered from hypo-/endolithic niches in hot deserts (Fig. 4 , S2 ). Adaptations to extremophilic life have been documented by considerable laboratory work (Supplementary Text 3 ) [ 15 , 19 ]. The three FaRLiP strains are CCMEE 10, 12 and 130, with the first two identical in 16S rRNA gene sequences. Out of them, CCMEE 10 has been recently shown to only carry a partial, though functional, FaRLiP cluster, lacking Photosystem I genes [ 42 ]. The partial or total loss of FaRLiP genes seems surprising given that these strains are found in far-red light enriched habitats. It is possible that living in stable, extreme environments may result in less competition for light, leading to gene loss. Although gene loss in this phylum has been mainly studied in the highly reduced genomes of marine picocyanobacteria, the environmental stability hypothesized to underpin this genome optimization [ 36 ] might also apply to deserts. The majority of FaRLiP-positive strains in this study fall under the classification of Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto (I) (Fig. 4 , Table S6 ). All but one of the tested strains in this genus were FaRLiP-positive. Considerable support exists for FaRLiP in this group, as the genus included most of the genomes, sequences and strains recovered. Strains within Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto can be defined as generalists, as they appear to inhabit highly diverse environments. They have been found in freshwater, saltwater, as well as in dry soil and on rocks. However, they have only rarely been identified in hyperarid areas, unlike the closely related clade II, Hot desert Chroococcidiopsidales . Therefore, in contrast to the generally held view, they appear to be generalists with limited extremotolerance potential, supported by field and laboratory studies [ 16 , 19 ]. Genome comparisons suggest that, in contrast to related genera, they may carry a conserved group of genes associated with hypoxic conditions (Supplementary Text 4 ). We hypothesize that these genes could have been co-selected, together with FaRLiP, for living in shaded environments such as soil or microbial mats. These widespread generalist strains have mostly been underrepresented in discussions of Chroococcidiopsis phylogenetic history. Yet, not only do they form their own clade, but it is the largest among the known Chroococcidiopsidales . While this might be partially explained by sampling bias (non-extreme environments may be easier to sample), these strains appear to be extremely successful. They live in highly diverse environments, unlike those in extremophile genera. This might be due to higher competition, predation and many additional challenges in these moderate environments that are difficult to discern but shape evolution as much as the more obvious abiotic factors [ 82 ]. Not all lineages observed in this study were as straightforward to investigate as Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto . No genomes, and very few strains, were available for clades IV-V and VII-VIII. Therefore, we were unable to assess their FaRLiP capacity. Regarding environments, for Sinocapsa (IV) and ‘Additional desert clade’ (V), there were at least sufficient 16S rRNA gene sequences available with associated metadata to suggest that these groups may be extremotolerant (Fig. 4 ). The latter group included sequences sampled a wide variety of desert environments (Utah, Tibet, Atacama). For groups VII-VIII, there were few sequences available, and no inferences could be made. This study relied on recovering sampling locations from 16S rRNA datasets to balance out the limited strain availability. It proved particularly valuable for taxonomic groups for which cultured strains are rare, difficult to obtain/grow (as is the case with many polar microbes) or labeled with varying accuracy. It also allowed for correction of previous assumptions about prokaryote dispersal. Likely due to limited data, Chroococcidiopsis -related lineages have long been considered to be largely constrained to specific continents [ 15 ]. The present study, supported by additional work [ 12 ], contradicts this, showing that gene flow occurs frequently. Although nearby sampling locations may share closely related strains (sequences with >99% identity from similar locations were trimmed in our study) [ 15 ], this does not scale at higher taxonomic or geographic levels. For example, within a small branch of the Aliterella 16S rRNA gene tree, there are sequences from four continents, in no particular pattern. This is especially remarkable for extremophile clades, as deserts have been described functionally as “islands” [ 15 ]. Yet widespread geographic dispersal undoubtedly also plays a significant role for generalists, as they encounter diverse environments where survival may involve relying on various acclimation processes, such as FaRLiP. Conclusion Chroococcidiopsis has been previously defined as an extremophile cyanobacterium. However, many of the strains known under this name form separate genera. Some of them are specialists adapted to extreme environments such as hot or cold deserts; others are generalists. By combining bioinformatics data mining with large-scale laboratory assays, we have been able to connect genes, genomes, environments and adaptations. FaRLiP has been inherited from a common ancestor, and it remains near-universal in Chroococcidiopsis sensu stricto , a generalist genus. However, it has been commonly lost in specialist extremophile genera. It may have been co-selected with genes for hypoxic environments. Chlorophyll d was present in all our FaRLiP samples, supporting its predicted significant role in FaRLiP.

Credit: NASA Earth Observatory Cyanobacteria blooms (blue-green algae) are a frequent occurrence in the Great Lakes, particularly in Lake Erie, Green Bay, and Saginaw Bay. These blooms may cause fish kills and discolored or foul-smelling water, affecting both human and ecosystem health. NOAA provides forecasts of cyanobacteria blooms for Lake Erie from July to October. Some cyanobacteria blooms can grow rapidly and produce toxins that cause harm to animal life and humans, so scientists describe them as harmful algal blooms (HABs). NOAA Resources Lake Erie Harmful Algal Bloom Forecast NOAAâs Harmful Algal Bloom Bulletins are issued twice weekly during blooms of blue-green algae in Lake Erie. Harmful Algal Bloom Monitoring System: Near Real-Time Imagery NOAA's National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science developed this site to routinely deliver near real-time products for use in locating, monitoring, and quantifying algal blooms in coastal and lake regions of the U.S. This application delivers a suite of bloom detection products in the form of geographic-based images.

When the density of such harmful organisms leads to the presence of scum on the lake surface or discoloration of the water, they are known as harmful algal blooms (HABs). The frequency and severity of HABs has been linked to increased nutrient loading from human activities (Lopez et al . 2008), and cyanobacterial HABs are considered one of the clearest indicators of excess nutrient concentrations (Paerl and Fulton, 2006). Cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins (nervous system), hepatotoxins (liver) and dermatoxins (skin), posing a threat to human health when blooms occur in drinking water supplies. Additionally, cyanotoxins in recreational waters can pose a danger to people, pets, and livestock when they come in contact with the water. The data presented here pertain to microcystins, and not other algae which may produce toxins. The data for this indicator are the number of lake visits sampled per state for microcystins during EPA’s 2017 National Lakes Assessment, and the number of samples which contained greater than EPA’s national recommended human health recreational criterion of 8 µg/l. When applied as a Clean Water Act section 304(a) water quality criterion, EPA recommends no more than 3 excursions (10-day assessment periods) within a recreational season per year. When used as a swimming advisory, EPA recommends the value not be exceeded on any single day. Number of state lake visits sampled for microcystins and the number of samples which contained greater than 8 µg/l of microcystins.

U.S. EPA, Office Water and Office of Research and Development. Washington, DC. Data source information Data are from EPA’s 2017 National Lakes Assessment: The Third Collaborative Survey of Lakes in the United States (2022). In this study, EPA conducted a national survey of the condition of lakes, reservoirs and ponds, which included sampling for microcystins. Number of lake visits was obtained from table 2-2 in the 2017 National Lakes Assessment Technical Support Document . At each lake site, a sample was taken at a single station located at the deepest point in the lake, which would be expected to minimize the chance for false positives. Users may download the report and all the raw data directly from EPA’s National Lakes Assessment website Data from the National Aquatic Resource Surveys from the table entitled “National Aquatic Resource Surveys Data.” What to consider when using these data The lakes sampled for the 2017 National Lakes Assessment were chosen in a random, probability-based manner. However, while the base funding for the survey provided for the sampling of enough sites to make national and regional scale estimates of lake conditions, most states could not sample enough sites to allow for generation of state-level estimates. Therefore, the data shown here should not be extrapolated to make state-wide estimates of the percent of lakes presenting risk of exposure to microcystins. Users should also consider that the lake samples were collected for the survey at particular times during the summer of 2017, and the levels of microcystins are affected by spatial, temporal and climatic variables, such as season, temperature, and level of precipitation. Future assessments will continue to inform on the risk of exposure in different parts of the country. References and links to other data sources Graham, J.L., Loftin, K.A., and Kamman, N. 2009.

It has been hypothesized that the excreted nitrite represents excess nitrogen that cannot be further assimilated due to the missing carbon, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identified a protein that interacts with nitrite reductase, regulates nitrogen metabolism and promotes nitrite excretion. The protein, which we named NirP1, is encoded by an unannotated gene that is upregulated under low carbon conditions and controlled by transcription factor NtcA, a central regulator of nitrogen homeostasis. Ectopic overexpression of nirP1 in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 resulted in a chlorotic phenotype, delayed growth, severe changes in amino acid pools, and nitrite excretion. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that NirP1 interacts with nitrite reductase, a central enzyme in the assimilation of ammonia from nitrate/nitrite. Our results reveal that NirP1 is widely conserved in cyanobacteria and plays a crucial role in the coordination of C/N primary metabolism by targeting nitrite reductase.

Other cyanobacteria, such as Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 ( Synechococcus 7942) or Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ( Synechocystis 6803), have become model species for the CO 2 -neutral production of chemical feedstock and biotechnological processes driven by photosynthesis 4 , 5 . The two most relevant nutrients for cyanobacteria are inorganic carbon (C i ) and N. Most cyanobacteria assimilate combined inorganic N forms, such as ammonium (NH 4 + ), nitrate (NO 3 − ), nitrite (NO 2 − ), and urea; in addition, diazotrophic species can utilize N 2 gas. Surprisingly, several different cyanobacteria excrete nitrite under photoautotrophic growth conditions. Certain isolates of the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus were reported to release up to 30% of their N uptake as extracellular nitrite when grown on nitrate 6 . The released nitrite is cross-fed by other microbes that cannot consume nitrate or produce nitrite. Moreover, it was demonstrated that cooccurring microbes could be beneficial for Prochlorococcus 7 , 8 . In Synechococcus 7942, as well, approximately 30% of the produced nitrite were excreted in shifts to low C i (LC) conditions, while no nitrite was excreted under high C i (HC) conditions 9 . The coordination of C and N metabolism is regulated by several transcription factors and other regulatory proteins. An acute N scarcity is sensed by two central regulators of N assimilation in cyanobacteria, P II and NtcA, by binding the key metabolite 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . 2-OG connects C and N metabolism because it represents the main precursor for ammonia assimilation through the glutamine synthetase/glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS/GOGAT) cycle in cyanobacteria and plants. Initially, GS incorporates ammonia into glutamate, thereby producing glutamine. The amino group from glutamine is then transferred onto 2-OG by GOGAT, yielding two glutamate molecules. As a consequence, the intracellular level of 2-OG starts to increase once these reactions slow down due to insufficient N supply; thus, 2-OG is an excellent indicator of the N status 15 . Binding of 2-OG stimulates the activity of NtcA, the main transcriptional regulator of genes encoding proteins involved in N assimilation 10 , 11 . Depending on the 2-OG level, the P II interaction protein X (PipX) switches from binding to P II to interacting with NtcA, further enhancing the binding affinity of this complex to target promoters 12 , 14 . In Synechocystis 6803, NtcA directly activates 51 genes, including transporters for N sources and GS/GOGAT, and represses 28 other genes after 4 h of N starvation 16 . In addition to transcription factors, multiple different proteins have been identified that interact with these factors or the involved enzymes and govern their functions directly. Archetypical examples for these proteins are the inhibitory factors IF7 and IF17, as their binding to GS leads to the inactivation of the enzyme when N supply exceeds demand 17 . The P II -interacting regulator of arginine synthesis (PirA) regulates the flux into the ornithine-ammonia cycle and therefore arginine synthesis 18 , 19 , while the P II -interacting regulator of C metabolism (PirC) functions as an inhibitor of 2,3-phosphoglycerate–independent phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), the enzyme that shifts newly fixed CO 2 toward lower glycolysis 20 . PirC becomes sequestered by P II at low 2-OG levels and released for PGAM inhibition at high 2-OG levels and therefore connects the control of C and N assimilatory pathways in a particular way 20 . We have previously analyzed the primary transcriptomes of Synechocystis 6803 and the closely related strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6714 21 , 22 , 23 . Based on these analyses, many more genes encoding unknown small, potentially regulatory proteins were computationally predicted. Experiments using a 3xFLAG epitope tag fused in-frame to the 3′ ends of the respective reading frames validated five of these to encode small proteins 24 . Subsequent experimental analyses using coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) demonstrated that one of these small proteins, NblD, facilitates the degradation of phycobilisomes under N starvation conditions 25 , while another one, called AtpΘ, is an inhibitor of the ATP synthase back reaction under low energy conditions 26 . Collectively, these findings suggest that cyanobacteria use a broad collection of small protein modulators to regulate metabolism according to external clues. Here, we report a small, regulatory protein involved in the control of N assimilation in cyanobacteria in an unexpected way. This protein is 81 amino acids long in Synechocystis 6803, and its expression is upregulated following shifts from HC to LC conditions and downregulated upon N downshifts. Co-IP experiments identified the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR) as the primary target of this protein. Following this lead further, we characterize the protein as a regulatory factor in the primary assimilation of N from nitrate/nitrite. Based on the observed phenotype, we named the regulatory protein NirP1, for nitrite reductase interacting protein 1. Results The ncr1071 transcript exhibits coding potential The NtcA regulon in Synechocystis 6803 was reported to comprise 79 genes, including eight non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) 16 . One of these ncRNAs, with the transcript ID ncr1071, was strongly downregulated upon N step-down 16 . This transcript extends from position 2215954 to 2217039 on the forward strand of the Synechocystis 6803 chromosome (GenBank accession no. NC_000911) and was assigned to the transcriptional unit (TU) 2296 21 . When 10 different cultivation conditions were compared, TU2296 was found to be maximally transcribed under LC, while it was strongly repressed under N starvation conditions 21 . TU2296 overlaps the coding sequence of the sll1864 gene encoding a potential chloride channel protein on the reverse strand by more than 500 nt (Fig. 1a ). Fig. 1: Genomic location and expression of nirP1 in Synechocystis 6803. a The transcriptional unit TU2296 encompassing the coding sequence of nirP1 ( ncr1071 ) overlaps gene sll1864 annotated as encoding a chloride ion channel protein. Plot at low CO 2 (blue) versus N starvation (green). Transcriptional units (TUs) are indicated according to the previous annotation of the transcriptome and genome-wide mapping of transcriptional start sites 21 . The potential open reading frame of ncr1071 coding for the NirP1 protein is indicated by a black arrow. b Alignment of selected potential NirP1 homologs from cyanobacteria belonging to four morphological subsections 28 . The last and most conserved part of Synechocystis 6803 NirP1 from position 25 to the end is shown. The cysteine and tryptophan residues conserved in all 485 potential homologs (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) are marked by arrows. The alignment was generated using ClustalW and visualized by Jalview. c Time course of nirp1 mRNA accumulation in Synechocystis 6803 after cells precultivated in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (HC) for 3 h were shifted to medium without a source of C i (LC). The nirp1 transcript was detected by a 32 P-labeled single-stranded RNA probe. The membrane was rehybridized to a 5S rRNA probe as a loading control. The RiboRuler Low Range RNA ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as the molecular mass standard. The relative amount of nirp1 transcript normalized to the 5S rRNA is shown in the bar chart. The HC condition was set to 1, and all other signals were normalized to the HC condition. Two independent biological replicates were used and averaged. d NirP1 was detected in the presence or absence of C i by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum against tagged NirP1 under the control of its native promoter in two biological replicates (R1 and R2). The wild type was used as a control. Cultures were grown in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (+), washed, and cultivated in carbonate-free medium (-) for 24 h. Prestained PageRuler TM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a molecular mass marker. The blot has been performed in two independent experiments ( n = 2). e NirP1 structure predicted by AlphaFold 31 , 32 for the complete Synechocystis NirP1 protein, indicating the presence of four beta folds in the most conserved part. The four totally conserved amino acids as well as Cys27 and Cys81 are highlighted, tryptophan is shown in magenta, and cysteine in yellow. The Met1 residue is also indicated for orientation. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Upon closer inspection, we discovered that the first segment of this transcript exhibits potential to encode an 81-residue protein with a calculated IEP of 4.59 and a molecular mass of 9.18 kDa. Evidence for the possible existence of this protein was provided independently by mass spectrometry data from a deep proteogenomics dataset 27 . Based on the results below, we named this protein NirP1, for nitrite reductase interacting protein 1. Database searches identified 485 potential homologs of nirP1 (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) in species belonging to all morphological subsections of cyanobacteria 28 , including the well-studied model Synechococcus 7942, heterocyst-forming diazotrophic species and Section V strains, such as Fischerella . Homologous genes were detected in marine species with deviating pigmentation, such as Acaryochloris marina and Halomicronema hongdechloris , but not in Prochlorococcus and not in the majority of marine picoplanktonic Synechococcus strains. Homologs were also not detected in the genomes of diatom-associated symbionts Calothrix rhizosoleniae and Richelia intracellularis nor in the endosymbiont chromatophore genomes of photosynthetic Paulinella species or the UCYN-A Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa endosymbionts, which can perform N 2 fixation but lack photosystem II and phycobilisomes 29 , 30 . These data suggest that homologs of nirP1 were advantageous but not essential for free-living cyanobacteria with very different physiologies. The vast majority of the 485 putative homologs identified in this work (Supplementary Dataset 1 ) are between 76 and 86 aa in length. The alignment of selected NirP1 homologs highlights the conservation in the last ~50 aa and the presence of a centrally located, absolutely conserved single cysteine and three tryptophan residues (Fig. 1b ). To verify the inducibility of nirP1 transcription by shifts to LC conditions, cultures of Synechocystis 6803 precultivated in medium supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 (high C i , HC) were centrifuged and resuspended in medium lacking any source of C i . In Northern blot analysis, samples taken over 24 h showed a single signal of approximately 580 nt (Fig. 1c ) matching the length from the transcription start site (TSS) to the steep decline in the number of reads approximately 80 nt after the nirP1 stop codon (Fig. 1a ). A strong signal was obtained 1 h after the shift, with a slightly decreasing intensity at the later time points and increasing again at the 24 h sampling point. At a weaker intensity, the nirP1 mRNA was also detectable in the sample from high C i (HC)-grown cells. To directly validate the presence of NirP1, strains expressing NirP1 −3xFLAG fusions were constructed (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS‒PAGE) and Western blotting using anti-FLAG antiserum. Two signals of slightly different molecular masses were detected. The calculated molecular mass of ~12 kDa for the prominent signal in the samples from HC-grown cultures was consistent with the sum of the calculated molecular masses of 9.18 kDa for the monomeric NirP1 and 2.86 kDa for the 3xFLAG tag (Fig. 1d ). After the shift to LC conditions, a band migrating with a ~1.5 kDa larger molecular mass became more intense, possibly indicating a post-translational modification. No FLAG-tagged NirP1 was detected in the wild-type strain used as a control. From these experiments, we conclude that TU2296 encodes the small protein NirP1 and that nirP1 transcription responds to shifts in C i supply. To generate a model for the NirP1 structure, we used AlphaFold 31 , 32 , which modeled NirP1 as a monomer and predicted four beta folds in the most conserved part of the protein. No structure was predicted for the N-terminal section of the protein, consistent with a lack of sequence conservation (Fig. 1b ). Two cysteine residues (Cys27 and Cys81) in Synechocystis 6803 NirP1 were predicted to be in close proximity to each other, potentially forming a disulfide bond (Fig. 1e ), whereas a third, highly conserved Cys55 was found between two beta strands in the folded part, exposed to the outside. However, no functional domains could be predicted based on the primary sequence or modeled structure. Two transcription factors are involved in the regulation of nirP1 expression Based on literature reports 16 , we speculated that nirP1 expression could be negatively regulated by NtcA binding to a conserved binding site over the TSS. Moreover, we observed a tandem repeat element located further upstream consisting of two octameric repeats TTTGT(T/C)AA separated by a dinucleotide. In promoter sequence analyses of 456 nirP1 homologs (Supplementary Dataset 2 ), the NtcA-binding motif was present and conserved in 435 cases. The tandem repeat was found in 135 homologs (Supplementary Dataset 2 ; Supplementary Fig. S2 ). To investigate the possible regulation through these sequence elements, the promoter of nirP1 (P nirP1 ; from −70 to +30, TSS at +1) was engineered in a transcriptional fusion to drive the luxAB reporter genes. We used the native P nirP1 sequence or promoter variants with mutated, likely relevant nucleotides either in the NtcA-binding site (P NtcA-Mut ) or in the upstream promoter element (P Repeat-Mut ; Fig. 2a ). Fig. 2: NirP1 expression is mediated through a C i -sensitive promoter and the transcription factor NtcA. a Top: Native P nirP1 promoter sequence from position −70 to +30 (TSS at +1) used in a bioluminescence reporter strain harboring a P nirP1 - luxAB transcriptional fusion.

Middle row: Mutated nucleotides in the NtcA-binding site yielding promoter P NtcA-Mut are colored red. Bottom: Mutated nucleotides in the repeat motif yielding promoter P Repeat-Mut are colored red. Both mutated promoters were fused to luxAB and introduced into a neutral site in parallel with the P nirP1 - luxAB construct. b Bioluminescence of the Synechocystis 6803 P nirP1 - luxAB , P NtcA-Mut - luxAB reporter, and P Repeat-Mut - luxAB strains and a promoter-less (P less ) negative control. Cells were grown under HC conditions (BG11 supplemented with 10 mM NaHCO 3 ) for 2 h and transferred to BG11 medium without a CO 2 source to induce LC conditions for 24 h. c The strains were cultivated in BG11 (-N), and the chlorotic cultures were transferred back to standard BG11 (17.6 mM NaNO 3 ) medium to start the recovery process seven days after N starvation was initiated. d Strains were cultivated in standard BG11 and then 10 mM NH 4 Cl was added for 24 h. Bioluminescence data are presented as the means ± SDs of 3 independent measurements with three biological replicates each ( n = 9). Significance was calculated with a two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t -test; * P < 0.05; ** P < 0.01; *** P < 0.001) between the strains at corresponding time points (details of statistical analysis Supplementary Fig. S3 and in Supplementary Dataset 3 ). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image In strains P nirP1 and P NtcA-Mut , transcription was activated 1 h after a shift to medium lacking C i , followed by a decrease and a light increase again at the later time points (Fig. 2b , Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The increase at 24 h was not as pronounced as in the Northern blot (Fig. 1c ), pointing at the possible involvement of post-transcriptional regulation. This activation was significantly higher in the P NtcA-Mut strains with the mutated NtcA-binding site. This effect was even more pronounced after a shift to N starvation conditions (Fig. 2c ; Supplementary Dataset 3 ). These results indicated the repressor function of NtcA for nirP1 , consistent with previous ChIP-seq 16 and transcriptome data 21 . However, repression was still observed 6 h after the shift to N starvation, even when the binding motif was mutated rendering NtcA binding impossible, indicating the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms. It is possible that a second transcription factor is involved in the repression of nirP1 during N starvation. If the tandem repeat was mutated (P Repeat-Mut ), a signal close to baseline was detected in all tested conditions (Fig. 2b–d , Supplementary Dataset 3 ; Supplementary Fig. S3 ). We conclude that this motif is essential for the transcription of nirP1 , consistent with its position centered at −51.5 from the TSS at +1 (Fig. 2a ), a region where frequently transcription factors bind to activate transcription. Finally, transcriptional regulation was tested in response to the addition of ammonium (Fig. 2d ). The signal increased ~threefold after 1 h and then decreased, similar to the results obtained after the shift in LC conditions (Fig. 2b ). These data agree with the results of a recent transcriptome analysis in which the ncr1071 transcript was upregulated ~threefold during acclimation to ammonium stress 33 , indicating that the C/N balance is pivotal for the transcription of nirP1 . Collectively, these results demonstrated the complex transcriptional regulation of nirP1 . We validated the transcriptional regulation of nirP1 by NtcA and obtained new insight into the regulation of nirP1 in shifts to N deprivation and with different C/N ratios. Due to the observed strong regulation, we hypothesized that NirP1 might be a regulator and is likely involved in the acclimation to changing C i and N supply. Deletion and ectopic expression of NirP1 leads to phenotypical changes To test the potential functional importance of NirP1, we constructed the following strains: a gene deletion strain Δ nirP1 ; two overexpression strains in which the coding sequence of nirP1 was fused to a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag under control of the copper-inducible P petE promoter on a plasmid pVZ322 introduced in a wild type background (strain NirP1oex) and in the Δ nirP1 background (strain Δ nirP1 ::oex); and a complementation strain with the same plasmid as in the overexpression strains, except that nirP1 was controlled by its native promoter (Δ nirP1 :: nirP1 ). Under nutrient-replete conditions, the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant showed linear growth similar to the wild type. In contrast, both strains expressing nirP1 under control of the P petE promoter showed severely reduced growth in liquid medium, irrespective of whether the plasmid was in the wild type or the Δ nirP1 background (Fig. 3a ). The reduced growth observed at high nirP1 expression compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 was also visible under LC, while the strain grew normally if nirP1 was controlled by its native P nirP1 promoter (Fig. 3b ). Therefore, we concluded that the high expression of nirP1 from the P petE promoter led to reduced growth, in particular, to a prolonged lag phase (Supplementary Dataset 4 ). In addition, we noticed a pigmentation change, i.e., the cultures became chlorotic if nirP1 was overexpressed from the P petE promoter (Fig. 3c ). This effect was strictly dependent on the nirP1 expression level because cells of the non-induced mutant showed the same pigmentation as the wild type in the absence of added Cu 2 SO 4 . (Supplementary Fig. S4a ). This phenotype was verified in room temperature absorption spectra. Compared to the spectra of the wild type and deletion mutant, the phycobilisome peak at approximately 625 nm as well as the chlorophyll peaks at 440 and 680 nm were decreased in the two strains that expressed nirP1 from P petE after addition of Cu 2 SO 4 (Fig. 3d , Supplementary Dataset 4 ). Fig. 3: Phenotypical differences between nirP1 mutant strains and the wild type in BG11 medium. a Growth of wild type (black), the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant (red), and the strains expressing nirP1 under control of the P petE promoter in the wild-type background (dark blue, NirP1oex) and Δ nirP1 background (light blue, Δ nirP1 ::oex). Data points represent the mean ± SD of 3 biological replicates ( n = 3; details with growth rates and doubling time are provided in Supplementary Dataset 4 ). b Growth in liquid medium after shifting to LC conditions. Strains were cultivated for 2 h in medium containing 10 mM NaHCO 3 , collected, and transferred to medium without a C i source. The complementation strain (orange, Δ nirP1 :: nirP1 ) expressed nirP1 under the control of its native P nirP1 promoter in the Δ nirP1 background. Other strains as in ( a ); n = 3. c Pigmentation phenotype of wild-type and nirP1 overexpressors in the presence of Cu 2 SO 4 expressing nirP1 for 24 h. All cultures were set to an OD of ~0.8. d Room temperature absorption spectra for wild-type and nirP1 mutants expressing nirP1 for 24 h from the P petE promoter in the presence of Cu 2 SO 4 , normalized to wild-type OD 750 . Same strains and colors as in ( a ). Spectra were recorded from three biological replicates and averaged ( n = 3). Further phenotypical differences in Supplementary Figs. S4 and S5 . Full size image To extend these results, drop dilution assays were performed to compare growth on plates. Again, the strain that overexpressed nirP1 from the P petE promoter showed reduced vitality compared to the wild type and Δ nirP1 , irrespective of the addition of 10 mM NaHCO 3 (Supplementary Fig. S4b ). In conditions where nitrate was replaced by ammonium as the only N source, the phenotype was completely abolished (Supplementary Fig. S5 ). To summarize, the phenotypical effects due to ectopic NirP1 expression suggested that the amount of NirP1 played a critical role in the cell in presence of nitrate, while its absence did not lead to major phenotypic effects under the tested conditions. Metabolic changes in the GS/GOGAT and ammonia-ornithine cycle Upon nirP1 overexpression, the chlorotic phenotype (Fig. 3c, d ) resembled the pigmentation changes characteristic of N-starved cells. Together with the observed expression control by NtcA (Fig. 2 ), this suggested a primary relationship between NirP1 and processes related to the assimilation of N, albeit the regulatory effect of LC. Therefore, we tested whether the ectopic expression of NirP1 influences amino acid levels in the cell. Metabolites and amino acids were extracted in a time course experiment from wild type, Δ nirP1 , and NirP1oex following a shift to LC. The total amount of soluble amino acids was significantly higher in NirP1oex at 24 h after transfer to LC than in the other two strains (Fig. 4a , full data in Supplementary Dataset 5 ). However, a closer look at the data revealed that the higher amino acid levels in NirP1oex were mainly caused by the accumulation of a single amino acid, glutamate (Fig. 4b ). The glutamate level in Synechocystis 6803 is normally approximately 10 times higher than that of any other amino acid. Therefore, the increased accumulation of glutamate alone was responsible for the measured higher total amino acid amount in NirP1oex. However, for the direct product of glutamate amination by GS, glutamine, we measured lower levels in NirP1oex at 3 and 24 h after the shift to LC (Fig. 4b ). This result is consistent with previous analyses in which a decrease in glutamine content was observed in LC shifts 34 . In addition, we found that the concentrations of citrulline and arginine, which are produced from glutamine via the ornithine-ammonium cycle (OAC), were lowered in NirP1oex at 3, 12, and 24 h after the induction of expression (Fig. 4d ). In contrast, the aspartate levels were increased, consistent with its synthesis from glutamate by glutamate aspartate aminotransferase. These tendencies were confirmed in a repeat experiment (Supplementary Dataset 6 ). Furthermore, the concentration of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) was significantly higher in NirPoex than in the other strains (Fig. 4c ). This finding indicates an impaired regulation of the GS/GOGAT cycle and a reduced N assimilation caused by high NirP1 and is consistent with effect the of pigmentation (Fig. 3c ) and glutamine and glutamate concentration (Fig. 4b ). In the wild type and Δ nirP1 deletion mutant, 2-OG levels increased after 12 and 24 h, which was more pronounced in the deletion mutant pointing to a further regulation when NirP1 is absent (Fig. 4c ). We conclude that the upregulation of NirP1 caused several changes in amino acid levels related to the synchronization between C and N metabolism. As the OAC is involved in N storage and remobilization 35 , these results support that NirP1 plays a role as a regulator in N metabolism.

Significance was calculated with the two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t -test; *only P ≤ 0.05 are shown) for each strain and between the strains at corresponding time points. The measurements were independently repeated in triplicates ( n = 3) and the results confirmed (details in Supplementary Dataset 6 ). Full size image NirP1 interacts with ferredoxin-nitrite reductase Coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) was successfully used in the past to identify the interacting partners of Synechocystis 6803 small proteins NblD, AtpΘ, and SliP4, thereby providing essential hints for their specific functions 25 , 26 , 36 . Therefore, we used a strain-expressing epitope-tagged NirP1 to obtain insight into the molecular mechanism that involves NirP1. After 24 h of induction, total cell extracts of three replicates of NirP1oex were analyzed by SDS‒PAGE and Western blotting using anti-FLAG antisera. The size of the NirP1-3xFLAG signal in the Western blot matched the sum of the calculated molecular masses of 9.81 kDa for NirP1 and 2.86 for the 3xFLAG tag. No signal was detected in the wild type used as a negative control (Fig. 5a ).

The main interacting protein was identified as ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR), which is encoded by the nirA/slr0898 gene. d Western blot of NirP1 co-IP fractions using native, denaturing, or reducing conditions. All samples were loaded in biological replicates R1 and R2. e NirP1-NiR (WP_010873675.1) interaction in Synechocystis 6803 predicted by AlphaFold 31 , 32 using their full-length sequences. The interaction modeled for the NiR and NirP1 homologs from Synechococcus 7942 is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7b . Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image NirP1-3xFLAG and potential bound interaction partners were coimmunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-FLAG resin (Fig. 5b ). Elution fractions of the protein pull-down showed NirP1 in Coomassie-stained protein gels and an additional band of higher molecular mass in both replicates. Because signals were obtained in the Western blot at these two and a third position, this result pointed at potential interaction partners of NirP1 that were copurified with the bait protein. These additional proteins were still present after 8 washing steps, indicating a strong interaction with NirP1 (Fig. 5b ). Next, we subjected whole-cell lysates and eluate fractions to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC‒MS/MS)-based proteome analysis for the identification of coimmunoprecipitated proteins. In addition to NirP1, a single other protein was strongly enriched, which was identified as the 56 kDa ferredoxin-nitrite reductase (NiR), encoded by nirA ( slr0898 ) (Fig. 5c ). Overall, eight and 72 nonredundant peptides of the NirP1-3xFLAG protein and of NiR were detected, yielding high respective sequence coverages of 94% and 98% (Supplementary Datasets 7 , 8 , and 9 ). The combined molecular masses of NirP1 and NiR are compatible with the uppermost signal in the Western blot in Fig. 5b . These results indicated that NiR was a specifically enriched protein that coimmunoprecipitated with the NirP1-3xFLAG protein under the conditions used. To validate the potential complex formation between NirP1 and NiR, Western blot experiments were performed under different reducing conditions. Under native conditions, two bands appeared. The signal at the lower molecular mass matched the predicted molecular mass of monomeric NirP1, while the upper signal was consistent with the sum of NirP1 and NiR of ~70 kDa. After the samples were denatured by heating or reduced through an addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol, the ~70 kDa signal disappeared. The single remaining band migrated higher than the band of the native form, indicating that it was the monomeric and completely unfolded NirP1 protein (Fig. 5d ). Modeling by AlphaFold 31 , 32 predicted NirP1 binding to the NiR substrate binding pocket next to its catalytic center with the iron-sulfur cluster where the reduction of nitrite takes place (Fig. 5e ). Interestingly, none of the NirP1 cysteine residues, but two of the three totally conserved tryptophan residues (W36 and W65), were predicted close to the catalytic center. Thus, these amino acids potentially play a functional role. Excretion of nitrite is triggered by NirP1 To test if the action of NirP1 might lead to the excretion of nitrite in LC conditions, as previously reported for Synechococcus 7942 9 , we first verified if Synechocystis 6803 showed this effect as well. Indeed, after 2 h at LC, the Synechocystis 6803 wild type, but not the Δ nirP1 deletion mutant, started to excrete nitrite into the medium (Fig. 6a, b ). After 24 h at LC, the concentration of nitrite in the medium of the wild-type strain was ~5 µM. However, in the nirP1 -overexpressing strain the nitrite concentration was much higher with ~75 µM (Fig. 6a, b ). All three results (Δ nirP1 , wild type, NirP1oex) suggested that the excretion of nitrite into the supernatant was related to the presence of NirP1 in the cell. This effect was even more pronounced by the ectopic overexpression of NirP1 in BG11 medium aerated with 5% (v/v) CO 2 leading to an ~150-fold higher accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant of NirP1oex compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 grown samples (HC in Fig. 6a ). After the cells were washed and resuspended in fresh medium, the overexpressor immediately excreted nitrite again (time point 0 in Fig. 6a ). These data establish that NirP1 triggers the excretion of nitrite. Fig. 6: Excretion of nitrite is triggered in the presence of NirP1. a Synechocystis 6803 strains were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 medium with 5% (v/v) CO 2 in air as high C i (HC), harvested and resuspended in new medium and aerated with 0.04% (v/v) CO 2 in air to initiate LC conditions. The wild type (WT) started to excrete nitrite in LC conditions when nirP1 was expressed (see Fig. 1c ). b Same data as in ( a ) but at different scales to include the results from the NirP1oex strain. Accumulation of nitrite in the supernatant was followed over time. c The consumption of nitrate, measured as the decrease in the concentration of nitrate in the supernatants after pelleting the cells by centrifugation. Strains were grown in BG11, washed with N-free BG11 (BG11 –N), set to OD = 1 and resuspended in BG11 containing 200 µM nitrate. d The production and excretion of nitrite into the supernatant measured in the same samples as in ( c ) for nitrate. Data are presented as the means ± SD of measuring biological triplicates in duplicates each ( n = 6). Significance was calculated using a two-tailed t -test with unequal variance (Welch’s t- test; ns no significance; *only P < 0.05 are shown) between the strains at corresponding time points. Full details are provided in Supplementary Dataset 10 . Full size image To ensure that the accumulated nitrite was a product of absorbed and reduced nitrate, the uptake of nitrate and subsequent excretion of nitrite were measured in parallel. The cultures were first grown in N-free BG11 medium and then 200 µM nitrate was added. In the control experiment, an additional 2 mM ammonia was added because nitrate uptake in Synechocystis is inhibited in the presence of ammonia and the transcription of nitrate and nitrite reductase genes is repressed. After 2 h, the overexpressor led to significant differences in nitrite concentration in the medium compared to wild type and Δ nirP1 . In addition, the overexpression seemed to slow the uptake of nitrate (Fig. 6c, d ). Here, the wild type, although less pronounced than the overexpressor, also excreted nitrite into the medium, as observed in the LC shift experiment before. In contrast, in the control experiment with additional ammonium, no nitrate uptake and no excretion of nitrite into the medium were observed (Supplementary Fig. S6a, b ). These results demonstrated that the accumulation of nitrite in the medium of the wild type and overexpression strains resulted from nitrate uptake, the subsequent reduction to nitrite by NR and the alteration of NiR activity, with the involvement by NirP1. Discussion Nitrate is one of the most abundant N-containing nutrients for cyanobacteria, while the preferred source for nitrogen assimilation is ammonium. Therefore, complex regulatory mechanisms occur to regulate nitrogen assimilation and uptake, e.g., genes of nitrate assimilation are repressed if ammonium is available 37 , 38 . When nitrate is the only N source available, it is taken up and reduced in two steps to nitrite and ammonium, which is then incorporated into glutamate in the GS/GOGAT cycle (Fig. 7 ). The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is catalyzed by the enzyme NR and the subsequent reduction to ammonium by NiR. NirP1, a small regulatory protein, is upregulated in LC conditions in Synechocystis 6803 (Fig. 1a ). Its elevated expression, as shown in this study, leads to the accumulation of nitrite in the medium. We identified NiR as the primary binding partner for NirP1 (Fig. 5c ). Therefore, the results can be explained if the NirP1:NiR interaction directly leads to the accumulation of nitrite in the cell, which is toxic and therefore becomes rapidly exported (Fig. 7 ). Excess internal nitrite has been shown to inhibit photosynthesis, particularly the activity of photosystem II in Synechocystis 6803 39 . Comparable responses were reported for N-starved Synechocystis 6803 mutants defective in glycogen synthesis that excreted 2-OG and pyruvate 34 . Fig. 7: NirP1 is a regulator at a central position in the assimilation of inorganic nitrogen. Cyanobacteria can assimilate N from simple compounds, such as ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, and urea. During nitrate assimilation, intracellular nitrate is reduced in two steps to nitrite and ammonium, which is then incorporated into glutamate in the GS/GOGAT cycle or into carbon skeletons during the synthesis of amino acids by transaminases. The reduction of nitrate to nitrite is catalyzed by the NR and the subsequent reduction to ammonium by the NiR. Transcription of the regulatory factor NirP1 is controlled by an unknown transcription factor (TF) and by NtcA. 2-OG is a corepressor of NtcA. Therefore, an increased 2-OG level leads to the repression of nirP1 transcription, while a low level of 2-OG leads to its activation. NirP1 binds to the enzyme nitrite reductase (NiR), leading to the inhibition of nitrite reduction. The accumulating nitrite is then rapidly exported by an unidentified export system. Transport systems for ammonium (AMT) and nitrate/nitrite (NRT) uptake are shown. Full size image Several factors control primary N metabolism, such as the transcription factor NtcA or the P II regulator and proteins interacting with them 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 , 19 . However, unlike several other regulatory proteins that modulate the activity of other regulators (e.g., PirA and PipX), NirP1 targets one of the key enzymes of N assimilation metabolism directly. This is reminiscent of the direct inhibitory role of the small GS inhibitory factors IF7 and IF17 17 . These findings suggest that a higher number of relatively small proteins might exist that modulate or modify the activity of relevant enzymes and await characterization. To examine the possible mode of action, we further predicted the interactions between NiR and other proteins. In Synechocystis 6803, ferredoxin Fd1 ( ssl0020, petF ) acts as an electron donor for the reduction of nitrite 40 . Therefore, we modeled the interaction of NiR with NirP1 (Fig. 5e ) and Fd1 (Supplementary Fig. S7a ). The results suggested that both proteins compete for the binding pocket of NiR. By binding NirP1 instead of Fd1, the binding pocket is blocked for electron transfer and the subsequent reduction of nitrite to ammonium. Thus, this could be a possible mechanism by which NirP1 inhibits NiR, leading to the excretion and accumulation of nitrite in the medium during NirP1 expression. Transcription of nirP1 is controlled by an unknown transcription factor and by NtcA. If 2-OG cannot be aminated efficiently in the GS-GOGAT cycle due to N starvation, C i oversupply, or a combination of both, it will accumulate in the cell. The increased 2-OG level is sensed by PII and transferred to NtcA, leading to stronger promoter binding and the repression of nirP1 transcription. Therefore, NirP1 is at the confluence of C and N assimilation and is effectively a regulator of the C/N balance. In addition to the NtcA-binding site, we found another putative promoter element at position −43 to −60 (Fig. 2a ), the mutation of which rendered the nirP1 promoter inactive. Therefore, this element is likely recognized by a positively acting transcription factor, although its identity was not further investigated in this work and should be studied in the future. It was previously reported that during photoautotrophic growth in shifts to LC conditions, Synechococcus 7942 excreted nitrite into the medium 9 . As the fundamental reason for this observation, a decline in the enzymatic activity of NiR was identified that started within 30 min. This decline was not a consequence of changed nirA expression because the observed decrease in NiR activity under LC conditions was substantially larger than that observed when the cultures were treated with rifampicin to inhibit transcription. Instead, a mechanism was postulated that directly inactivated NiR under LC conditions 9 . Our data were obtained in Synechocystis 6803, but a close NirP1 homolog is found in Synechococcus 7942 (Fig. 1b ), and an almost identical interaction with NiR was predicted (Supplementary Fig. S7b, c ). Therefore, we have likely identified the mechanism underlying previously observed NiR inhibition and nitrite excretion. We calculated that approximately 5% of assimilated nitrate was excreted as nitrite into the medium by Synechocystis 6803 in the first 2 h (Fig. 6c, d ). Compared to Prochlorococcus strains MIT0917 and SB, and Synechococcus 7942, which were reported to excrete up to 30% of the assimilated nitrate as nitrite 6 , 9 , the here-measured nitrite excretion of Synechocystis 6803 was less pronounced. Previous studies reported for Synechocystis 6803 a higher excretion, of up to 60% of the reduced nitrate under mixotrophic conditions 41 , which clearly shows that Synechocystis 6803 is capable to release high nitrite amounts into the medium. The nirP1 overexpression strain was obviously not significantly inhibited by the remaining nitrite, which could indicate that it had a way to avoid nitrite poisoning by storing it at a physiologically neutral place (or the regulation by NirP1 was not completely inhibiting the NiR activity). Indeed, there is circumstantial evidence for such a nitrite storage, possibly in the periplasm. We observed a very fast immediate release of nitrite from washed cells of the NirP1oex strain (see time point 0 in Fig. 6a ), which then was followed only by a slower further increase. Thus, under photoautotrophic conditions used here, the cells may have a mechanism to store most of the nitrite in order to resume normal N assimilation when the C i supply increases again. This points at a possible mechanism for deciding whether nitrite is released or kept within the cell, depending on the physiological conditions. These points are interesting topics for future research. According to our data, NirP1 expression is upregulated under LC conditions and then participated in the inhibition of NiR, leading to nitrite excretion and accumulation. Surprisingly, the regulation occurs at an unexpected point (Fig. 7 ), as controlling N assimilation during nitrate uptake or during nitrate reduction seems more intuitive. Here, uncontrolled nitrate uptake led to light-dependent nitrite excretion under low light conditions 42 . Therefore, the availability of electrons could play a role because the reduction of nitrite requires six moles of reduced ferredoxin, while the reduction of nitrate requires only two. Another consideration is the possible beneficial effect of nitrite excretion on cooccurring microbes in the natural environment. Certain Prochlorococcus release up to 30% of their N uptake as extracellular nitrite when grown on nitrate 6 . Prochlorococcus typically contains the most compact genomes of any free-living cyanobacteria, which was linked to its quasi-homeostatic environment 43 , 44 , 45 . Because we did not identify NirP1 homologs in Prochlorococcus , the underlying mechanism probably operates without NirP1. In other strains of cyanobacteria, exposed to greater variations in the environment, the involvement of NirP1 has likely led to a more accurate regulation. In any case, the release of an N cycle intermediate, such as nitrite, should have tremendous relevance for certain other members of the microbiome. Our results show that homologs of NirP1 are widely distributed among cyanobacteria, expanding our understanding of how C and N metabolism become integrated in these organisms. Methods Cultivation conditions and spectrometric measurements Strains were maintained in BG11 or in copper-free BG11 28 supplemented with 20 mM TES pH 7.5 under continuous white light of 50 µmol photons m −2 s −1 at 30 °C. Mutant strains containing pVZ322-derived plasmids were cultivated in the presence of 50 µg/mL kanamycin, while Δ nirP1 was maintained at 20 µg/mL streptomycin. The cultures for overexpression of NirP1 using the P petE promoter for pull-down experiments and MS measurements were grown either in BG11 or under CellDeg® conditions supplemented with 2 µM CuSO 4 . Cultivation with CellDeg® conditions was performed for 4 days in 100 mL FOM (freshwater organism medium; 50 mM NaNO 3 , 15 mM KNO 3 , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0.5 mM CaCl 2 , 0.025 mM H 3 BO 3 , supplemented with 0.15 mM FeCl 3 /Na 2 EDTA, 1.6 mM KH 2 PO 4 , 2.4 mM K 2 HPO 4 , 10 mM NaHCO 3 , 10 nM MnCl 2 , 0.1 nM ZnSO 4 , 2 nM Na 2 MoO 4 , 10 pM CuSO 4 , and 30 pM CoCl 2 ) inoculated with culture with a starting OD of ~0.8 and 150 μmol photons m − 2 s − 1 . High CO 2 concentrations were delivered to the flasks from a carbonate buffer (0.3 M K 2 CO 3 and 2.7 M KHCO 3 ) through a highly gas-permeable polypropylene membrane. Light intensity was increased during growth according to the cell density. 24 h prior harvesting the cells (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min), protein expression was started by adding 2 µM CuSO 4 . Cultures in growth experiments and phenotypic assays were grown in BG11 medium supplemented with copper but without antibiotics to prevent any possible side effects. Whole-cell absorption spectra were measured using a Specord® 250 Plus (Analytik Jena) spectrophotometer at room temperature and were normalized to the wild type at 750 nm. Cultures were measured in triplicate. Cultures at an OD 750 > 1 were diluted with 1× BG11 prior to taking the absorption spectra. Construction of mutant and overexpression lines Synechocystis 6803 PCC-M 46 was used as the wild type and background for the construction of mutants. Knockout mutants were generated by replacing the nirP1 ( ncr1070 ) coding sequence with a streptomycin resistance cassette ( aadA ) 47 by homologous recombination and using pUC19 as a vector for subcloning. The construct for gene replacement was generated by AQUA cloning 48 . Details of primer sequences and plasmids are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . Segregation of nirP1 and Δ nirP1/aadA alleles was checked by colony PCR using the primers P_AK9 and P_AK10 (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). To complement the knockout and create a NirP1-overexpressing strain, nirP1 was inserted into the self-replicating pVZ322 plasmid under control of the Cu 2+ -inducible P petE promoter or under control of its native promoter (P nirP1 ). The inserts for the overexpression of nirP1 were assembled into pVZ322 predigested by Xba I and Pst I for 16 h at 37 °C by AQUA cloning 48 . The constructs were checked using the primers P_AK16 and P_AK17 (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The sequence-verified plasmids were introduced into Synechocystis 6803 by electroporation 49 . For the electroporation, culture was cultivated to exponential phase with OD ~ 0.7–1.0, 25 mL washed three times with ice-cold HEPES buffer (1 mM, pH = 7.5) and resuspended in 0.5 mL HEPES buffer. 1 µg of plasmid was mixed with 100 µL of cells and transferred into a precooled Gene Pulser/MicroPulser Electroporation Cuvettes (0.2 cm gap, BIO-RAD). A pulse of 12.5 kV and 4 ms was executed (MicroPulser Electroporator, BIO-RAD), 1 mL of BG11 (BG11 lacking copper for constructs using the petE promotor) was added to the cells and transferred to 50 mL BG11 for 24 h cultivation under continuous light of 50 µmol photons m −2 s −1 at 30 °C. The culture was harvested (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min), resuspended in 100 µL BG11, and plated on 0.75% Kobe-agar plate with 50 µg/mL kanamycin and cultivated for 5 days. Single colonies were transferred on a new plate and verified by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1 , Supplementary Table S1 ). The expression of nirP1 was checked by Western hybridization using ANTI-FLAG antisera (Sigma–Aldrich, #SAB4301135). RNA preparation and northern blot verification Cultures were grown in BG11 supplemented with 10 mM NHCO 3 (HC), washed three times with BG11 lacking any C i source (LC), and grown for 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h in LC conditions to induce nirP1 expression. The time immediately before C i removal (0 h, HC) served as the negative control. Cells were collected by filtration through hydrophilic polyethersulfone filters (Pall Supor®−800, 0.8 μm), transferred into PGTX buffer, and instantly frozen in liquid N 2 50 . Samples were incubated for 10 min at 65 °C in a water bath, one volume chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added, and were incubated for 15 min at room temperature with several vortexing cycles. After centrifugation for 3 min at 3250 × g , the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, one volume of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol was added. This step was repeated twice. RNA was precipitated by the addition of one volume of isopropanol and incubated for 16 h at −20 °C. For northern blot verification, 10 μg of RNA per well was loaded on a 10% polyacrylamide-8.3 M urea gel and electroblotted onto Hybond N nylon+ membranes (Amersham) with 1 mA per cm 2 for 1 h. nirP1 transcript accumulation was analyzed by Northern hybridization using single-stranded radioactively labeled RNA probes transcribed in vitro from PCR-generated templates using primer P_AK30 and P_AK31 (Supplementary Table S1 ). The radioactively labeled probes were generated using [α- 32 P]-UTP and the Maxiscript T7 In vitro transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Hybridizations were performed in 50% deionized formamide, 7% SDS, 250 mM NaCl, and 120 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 pH 7.2 overnight at 62 °C. The membranes were washed in buffer 1 (2× SSC (3 M NaCl, 0.3 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 1% SDS), buffer 2 (1× SSC, 0.5% SDS) and buffer 3 (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) each for 10 min. All wash steps were performed at 57 °C. Signals were detected with a Laser Scanner Typhoon FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare). Signal intensities of nirP1 were determined using Quantity One software (BIO-RAD) and normalized to the signal of the 5S rRNA (Fig. 1c ). Promoter analysis To verify nirP1 promoter activity in vivo in Synechocystis 6803, the nucleotides −70 to +30 (TSS at +1) were fused to luxAB reporter genes and integrated into the genome. Initially, cultures were set to an OD 0.7 and grown under standard BG11 or HC conditions for 2 h and subsequently transferred to NO 3 − - or NaCO 3 -free BG11 or BG11 medium supplemented with additional NH 4 Cl to induce transcription. Measurements were carried out for 24 h in LC or high NH 4 Cl conditions or for 7 days under N deprivation. To recover from N starvation, the bleached cells were transferred back to standard BG11 medium after 7 days and observed for 3 days. Bioluminescence was measured in vivo as total light counts per second by using a VICTOR 3 multiplate reader (PerkinElmer). Prior to the measurement, cells were diluted to an OD 750 = 0.7 and 200 μL of the suspension were filled into a white 96-well plate (CulturePlate™−96, PerkinElmer). To increase the signal, 2 µL of Decanal was added to the samples. In the multiplate reader the cell suspensions were shaken for 10 s and subsequently total light emission was measured for 1 s. A strain carrying the promotorless luxAB genes served as a negative control 51 . The raw data, the calculation, and statistical evaluations are provided in Supplementary Dataset 3 . Co-IP, LC-MS/MS analyses, and data processing The overexpression of NirP1-3xFLAG was induced in exponentially growing cultures of the Synechocystis 6803 strain NirP1oex in the CellDeg system by adding Cu 2 SO 4 to a final concentration of 2 µM. 50 mL of cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g , 4 °C, 10 min) after 24 h of NirP1-3xFLAG overexpression, resuspended in 2 mL FLAG buffer (50 mM HEPES-NaOH pH 7; 5 mM MgCl 2 ; 25 mM CaCl 2 , 150 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.1% Tween-20) supplemented with Protease Inhibitor (cOmplete, Roche) mixed with 100 μL of glass beads (Ø 0.1–0.25 mm, Retsch) and lysed mechanically in a prechilled Precelly24 (Bertin Instruments) with three rounds of shaking at 6000 rpm (10 s) followed by a pause (5 s) per cycle, for a total of 5 cycles. To remove cell debris and glass beads, extracts were centrifuged (1000 × g , 5 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were collected for further processing. Remaining cell debris was removed by centrifugation (15,000 × g , 4 °C, 30 min). The cleared total cell lysate was subjected to co-IP using Anti-FLAG M2 affinity magnetic beads (Sigma–Aldrich) rotating for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 8 times with FLAG buffer (2 min, 4 °C, rotating). Bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (Sigma–Aldrich, 100 ng/µL) in TBS buffer (150 mM NaCl in 20 mM Tris/HCl, pH = 7.6) at 4 °C. Two independent replicates were prepared. Protein concentrations of eluate fractions and respective whole-cell lysates were measured in the Coomassie Plus Bradford Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific) through the plate photo reader 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer) in duplicate, and 500 µL of each was subsequently snap frozen. Proteins in whole-cell lysates were purified by acetone/methanol precipitation 52 , and co-IP eluates were lyophilized. For further analysis, samples were resolubilized in denaturation buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thiourea in 100 mM Tris/HCl; pH 8.0) at a final protein concentration of 1 µg/µL. Protein disulfide bonds were reduced with 1 mM dithiothreitol for 45 min and the resulting thiol groups were alkylated with iodoacetamide at a final concentration of 5.5 mM for 45 min. Predigestion of proteins with Lys-C (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h was followed by dilution with 4 volumes of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8, and overnight digestion with trypsin (sequencing grade, Promega), both at protease/protein ratios of 1/100. The resulting peptide solutions were acidified with trifluoroacetic acid to pH 2.5, and an aliquot corresponding to 10 µg peptides was purified by stage tips 53 . For LC‒MS/MS-based protein analysis, 40 ng of each sample was loaded onto an in-house-made 20 cm column with 75 µm ID, packed with ReproSil-Pur 1.9 µm C18 material (Dr. Maisch, Germany) and separated by RP chromatography on an EASY-nLC 1200 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) using 60 min gradients. Eluting peptides were analyzed on an Orbitrap Exploris 480 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) as described elsewhere 54 . All raw spectra were processed with MaxQuant software (version 1.6.8.0) 55 at default settings. The match between run option and label-free quantification (LFQ) was enabled. Peak lists were searched against an in-house modified target-decoy database of Synechocystis 6803 with 3,681 protein sequences, including the NirP1-3xFLAG fusion protein sequence. False discovery rates were limited to 1% at the peptide and protein levels. LFQ protein intensities of two independent co-IPs were normalized by corresponding values from whole-cell extract measurements, log 2 transformed, and plotted against each other using the Perseus software suite (version 1.6.5.0) 56 . SDS‒PAGE, native gel electrophoresis and western blotting Proteins were mixed with denaturing or reducing loading dye (5× concentrated: 250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 10% SDS, 500 mM DTT, and 0.05% bromophenol blue G-250). Moreover, 6% ß-mercaptoethanol (v/v) was added fresh to the sample in reducing conditions before heating for 5 min at 95 °C. The protein samples were separated by 12% SDS‒PAGE using the PageRuler TM molecular weight marker (Thermo Fisher). To run samples under nonreducing conditions, a native loading dye (5× concentrated: 30% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue G-250, 150 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5) was used, and boiling was omitted. To make proteins visible, the gel was stained with Coomassie dye. The gel was incubated for 30 min under slight shaking, covered with Instant Blue Coomassie Protein Stain (Abcam), and washed overnight with ddH 2 O. For immunoblot analysis, separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Amersham TM Protan, pore size 0.4 5 µm). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% milk powder in TBS-T, washed three times (10 min), and subsequently probed with monoclonal ANTI-FLAG® M2-Peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Sigma–Aldrich, #SAB4301135 at a dilution of 1:5000) in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature in the dark and washed again three times (10 min). All washing steps were performed with TBS-T (20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20) at room temperature. Signals were detected with WesternBright TM ECL-spray (Advansta) on a chemiluminescence imager system (Fusion SL, Vilber Lourmat) and subsequently visualized using FUSION-CAP (Vilber Lourmat) and Quantity One software (BIO-RAD). Nitrate and nitrite measurements Wild type, Δ nirP1 , and nirP1 -overexpressing cultures were cultivated photoautotrophically in BG11 medium with 5% (v/v) CO 2 in air as the high CO 2 condition (HC), harvested and resuspended in new medium and aerated with 0.04% (v/v) CO 2 in air to start low CO 2 (LC) conditions. Samples were taken under HC conditions before cells were shifted to LC conditions and then after 0, 2, 4, 6, and 24 h of growth in LC conditions and measured in biological triplicates. To measure nitrate uptake and nitrite accumulation, cells were washed three times and resuspended in BG11 without NaNO 3 (BG11-N) lacking CuSO 4 . After incubation for 1 h, only 200 µM NaNO 3 as the nitrogen source or NaNO 3 together with 2 mM NH 4 Cl and a final concentration of 2 µM CuSO 4 were added. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and centrifuged (16,800 × g , 5 min, room temperature). Concentrations in the resulting supernatants were determined by ion chromatography measurements or with the Griess Reagent Kit (Promega). For IC measurements, samples were mixed with methanol (1:3 (v:v)) and centrifuged three times (16,800 × g , 10 min, room temperature), and 10 µL was loaded and separated by a column (DionexTM IonPacTM AS11-HC, Thermo Fischer). Ions were identified, and concentrations were quantified using the area (µS min −1 ) given in the software (Chromeleon® 7). Standards at various concentrations were used for calibration. The raw data, calculations, and statistical evaluations are given in Supplementary Dataset 10. Nitrite was measured after conversion into an azo dye 57 . The determination limit was 0.09 µmol L −1 . The combined standard uncertainty was 4.9%. Samples higher than the measuring range were diluted with ultrapure water. Extraction and metabolite analysis Wild type, Δ nirP1 , and nirP1 overexpressor cultures were set in duplicates or triplicates to an OD of 0.5 and grown for 24 h without antibiotics before cells were pelleted by centrifugation (3,210 × g, 10 min, room temperature), washed three times in copper-free BG11 medium and induction of NirP1 was started by adding 2 µM CuSO 4 after 1 h. After 0, 1, 3, 12, and 24 h of incubation, 2 mL of each culture was collected by centrifugation (16,800 × g , 5 min, room temperature) and immersed in liquid N 2 . For extraction, 630 µL of methanol containing carnitine (internal standard, 1 mg per extraction) was added, mixed for 1 min, and incubated for 5 min in a sonic water bath. After another 15 min of shaking at room temperature, 400 µL of chloroform was added, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Next, 800 µL of ROTISOLV LC‒MS grade H 2 O (Roth) was added, and the sample was mixed thoroughly. Precipitation was enabled by storage at 22 °C for at least 2 h, and phase separation was subsequently achieved by centrifugation for 5 min at room temperature (16,800 × g ). The upper polar phase was collected and dried in a speed vac for 30 min followed by lyophilization overnight. Absolute metabolite contents were quantified on a high-performance liquid chromatography‒mass spectrometer LC‒MS-8050 system (Shimadzu) 58 . Dried samples were dissolved in 200 μL LC‒MS grade water and filtered through 0.2-mm filters (Omnifix-F, Braun, Germany), and 5 μL of the cleared supernatant was separated on a pentafluorophenylpropyl column (Supelco Discovery HS FS, 3 mm, 150 3 2.1 mm). The compounds were identified and quantified using the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) values given in the LC‒MS/MS method package and the LabSolutions software package (Shimadzu). Authentic standard substances (Merck) at various concentrations were used for calibration, and peak areas were normalized to signals of the internal standard (carnitine). The data were further normalized to the OD 750 and volume measured for each sample. The raw data and estimations as absolute values in ng per mL per OD 750 are given in Supplementary Datasets 5 and 6 , with all the statistical evaluations.

However, recalcitrance to genetic manipulation barred their use as model systems for deciphering the clock function. Here, we explore the circadian clock in the now genetically amenable Cyanothece 51142, a unicellular, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium. Unlike non-diazotrophic clock models, Cyanothece 51142 exhibits conspicuous self-sustained rhythms in various discernable phenotypes, offering a platform to directly study the effects of the clock on the physiology of an organism. Deletion of kaiA , an essential clock component in the cyanobacterial system, impacted the regulation of oxygen cycling and hindered nitrogenase activity. Our findings imply a role for the KaiA component of the clock in regulating the intracellular oxygen dynamics in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria and suggest that its addition to the KaiBC clock was likely an adaptive strategy that ensured optimal nitrogen fixation as microbes evolved from an anaerobic to an aerobic atmosphere under nitrogen constraints.

To adapt to such constantly changing conditions, most organisms have evolved to develop an endogenous time-keeping system that proactively synchronizes physiological processes to the external light-dark cycle. Over the years, studies have established intimate connections between this time-keeping clock and cellular metabolism across all phylogenetic groups, with the endogenous rhythms orchestrating key parameters like growth, development, stress response, and reproductive fitness 1 , 2 , 3 . Concerted efforts over decades have unraveled various facets of the circadian clock in different model systems. The simplest model organisms to possess a bona fide and fully functional internal clock are cyanobacteria, oxygenic photosynthetic prokaryotes 1 , 4 , 5 . Cyanobacteria have inhabited our planet for billions of years and have successfully transitioned through the extremely harsh environmental and geophysical conditions that prevailed during different phases of Earth’s evolutionary history. Some of the key events that shaped Earth’s early biome and its evolution thereafter include the nitrogen crisis, which led to the emergence of nitrogen-fixing organisms 6 , 7 and cyanobacteria-mediated transformation of Earth’s initial reducing geochemical environment into an oxidizing one 8 , 9 that resulted in the burgeoning of aerobic life on our planet. Moreover, due to various geophysical events, the earth’s rotation period changed significantly over the history of our planet, subjecting evolving microbes to major day-length changes 10 . Central to the coping mechanisms deemed necessary for survival and fitness under these changing circumstances, was the evolution of a timekeeping mechanism that would orchestrate the physiological processes of microbes in response to the environment 4 , 9 . The observation made decades ago, that unicellular cyanobacteria can perform nitrogen fixation under continuous light, hinted at the existence of an endogenous rhythm that segregates photosynthesis from nitrogen fixation 11 , 12 . These initial studies provided the first clues for the occurrence of a circadian clock in prokaryotes. Subsequent studies in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria suggested a role for the endogenous clock in orchestrating not only nitrogen fixation but other metabolic processes as well 13 , 14 . However, owing to their recalcitrance to any genetic manipulation, the clock-mediated segregation of processes remained largely unexplored in this group of prokaryotes. Instead, the unicellular non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 was adopted as the model system for understanding the cyanobacterial clock mechanism. Many elegant studies in this strain over the past decades have unraveled various facets of the cyanobacterial clock. A genetic screen identified a cluster of three genes kaiA , kaiB , and kaiC , that encode the core proteins of the clock 15 . KaiA promotes the autokinase activity of KaiC while KaiB promotes its intrinsic autophosphatase activity by inhibiting the stimulatory effect of KaiA 16 , 17 . Subsequent studies demonstrated the role of the clock in regulating global patterns of gene expression and cell division 18 , 19 . The fundamental oscillatory mechanism of the clock was also deciphered 20 , 21 . However, a direct involvement of the clock in regulating physiological processes could not be demonstrated 5 . Studies have extensively investigated the temporal separation of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation in unicellular diazotrophic strains like Crocosphaera and Cyanothece under diel growth conditions 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 . Studies have also shown nitrogen fixation under continuous light and in the subjective dark period of light/dark entrained cells 27 , 28 , 29 . However, the role of the clock in orchestrating these processes, though hypothesized by many, has not been studied under any of these conditions. Here we provide the first direct evidence of the involvement of the circadian clock in maintaining endogenous rhythms of physiological processes in a unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that performs aerobic nitrogen fixation. Our work shows that kaiA , a clock gene that occurs only in cyanobacteria among all prokaryotes, is required for maintaining robust rhythms in intracellular oxygen cycling, a phenomenon that provides a stringently controlled cellular environment for nitrogen fixation in an otherwise oxygen-rich platform. Abolishing the rhythms, as is observed in the ∆ kaiA mutant, negatively impacts nitrogen fixation rates which can be revived by providing an anaerobic environment to the cells. Our findings suggest that a kaiA- controlled circadian clock is essential for optimal growth under diazotrophic conditions and such a clock likely evolved as nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria transitioned from an anaerobic to an aerobic atmosphere. Results The clock is indispensable in Cyanothece 51142 Analysis of the genome of Cyanothece 51142 revealed that the canonical kaiA (cce_0424) , kaiB1 (cce_0423), and kaiC1 (cce_0422) genes that are ubiquitous among cyanobacteria, are part of a larger cluster that is well conserved within unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that fix nitrogen aerobically 26 , 30 , 31 (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). In order to decipher the role of the KaiABC clock, we used CRISPR to create deletion mutants of kaiA , B1 and C1 genes in Cyanothece 51142. Under nitrogen sufficient conditions, we could obtain completely segregated mutants of kaiA and kaiB1 but the kaiC1 CRISPR mutant did not segregate in our hands (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Therefore, we attempted to delete the kaiC1 gene by the more conventional homologous gene replacement method and enforced segregation of the transgenic lines by applying antibiotic pressure. Even under very high antibiotic pressure a WT copy of the kaiC1 gene was retained in the genome. We then attempted to eliminate the kaiC1 gene by deleting the entire kaiAB1C1 cluster, an approach that also remained unsuccessful. Our repeated failure to delete the kaiC1 gene indicated that unlike Synechococcus 7942, where all the clock genes are dispensable 32 , 33 , the clock cannot be completely eliminated in Cyanothece 51142. Comparison of the growth phenotypes of the ∆ kaiA and ∆ kaiB1 mutants under CL in the absence of any added nitrogen sources revealed that of the two, kaiA is essential for sustenance of robust endogenous rhythms observed in the WT (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). To investigate the role of these endogenous rhythms in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria, in this study we focus on the ∆ kaiA mutant of Cyanothece 51142. The ∆kaiA mutant exhibits various phenotypic defects To evaluate the effect of the deletion of kaiA on the physiology of Cyanothece 51142, we compared the growth of the WT and the ∆ kaiA mutant under continuous light (CL) and light-dark (LD) conditions (photoautotrophic growth), in media lacking any fixed sources of nitrogen. When grown under CL and nitrogen-fixing conditions, in the absence of any external entraining light cues, the WT exhibits an endogenous rhythm of approximately 24 h ( ∽ 16:8 LD phases) (Supplementary Fig. 3 , Fig. 1a ). The rhythm corresponds to a rise in OD 730 during the photosynthetic phase of growth (approximately 16 h), followed by a drop in OD 730 for the next 8 hours of the nitrogen-fixing phase. In contrast to the WT, the ∆ kaiA mutant exhibited a significantly dampened rhythm under CL, which eventually faded away with time. The rhythms in the growth of the WT and the ∆ kaiA mutant were largely consistent across multiple runs (Source data). Multiple colonies of the mutant were tested (see method section) and consistency in rhythm was also observed across all the tested clones. To assess if the loss in rhythm observed in the mutant was a direct effect of the deletion of kaiA and not due to a malfunctioning of the remaining clock components, we generated a ∆ kaiA’ complementation strain (Supplementary Fig. 4a ). The complementation helped restore the rhythms under CL to WT levels, confirming that the loss of rhythm in the mutant can solely be attributed to the absence of KaiA (Supplementary Fig. 4b ). Fig. 1: Growth comparison of the WT and ∆ kaiA strains of Cyanothece 51142 in nitrogen-deficient media. Self-sustained endogenous rhythms of ~24 h are reflected in growth under CL( a ). Rhythm imposed by 12:12 LD cycles ( b ). The CL curve is an average of three independent runs of the WT and 5 independent runs of the mutant. The LD curve is an average of 3 independent runs of the WT and the mutant. Black bars represent dark phase of growth. Full size image To enhance the visibility of the cyclic patterns of the growth data as well as to perform quantitative analysis, small fluctuations in the growth measurements were removed using a moving-average filter. Then the overall growth trend of the samples was approximated by fitting an exponential curve. We then subtracted these trends from the smoothed growth measurements to elucidate the cyclic patterns in the data. Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the detrended growth of three independent runs (measured using OD 730) of the WT and five independent runs of the ∆ kaiA mutant over 4 days. Our analysis showed that the WT strain not only exhibited greater oscillations compared to the mutant, it also maintained these patterns over the full duration of the experiment. Cyclic variations in the growth of the mutant dampened quickly. In order to quantitatively compare the diurnal patterns observed in the CL growth data, we performed the power spectrum density (PSD) analysis on the (detrended) growth data. Supplementary Fig. 6 , shows the PSD of growth data at different frequencies of a selected sample of the WT and a ∆ kaiA mutant. The analysis revealed that the WT strain had an overall higher level of PSD compared to the mutant. It also revealed that the PSD of the wild type at the diurnal frequency (that is 1 cycle/day) was more than twice that of the mutant. We employed the Mann-Whitney U-test to compare the growth parameters and the diurnal oscillations between WT and the ∆ kaiA mutants. This analysis revealed a statistically significant ( p -value < 5%) higher level of growth as well as larger diurnal oscillations in the WT compared to the ∆ kaiA mutant. The ∆ kaiA mutant also exhibited significantly reduced biomass accumulation, reduced chlorophyll content, and a bleached phenotype which correlated with the observed degradation in phycocyanin levels (Supplementary Fig. 7 , S8a, c ). Under 12 h LD and diazotrophic growth conditions, the endogenous rhythm in growth coincides with the imposed LD cycles, with OD increasing for the first 12 h of light followed by a decrease in OD for the subsequent 12 h of darkness. This decrease in OD during the dark phase reflects carbohydrate degradation and utilization during nitrogen fixation 34 . The mutant exhibited a similar diurnal rhythm in growth pattern as the WT although biomass accumulation was lower (Fig. 1b , Supplementary Fig. 7 ). Absorption spectra of samples grown under 12:12LD conditions revealed a slight reduction in phycocyanin content (also reflected in the color of the culture) but chlorophyll content was not significantly different (Supplementary Fig. 8b, d ). An intrinsic property of the circadian clock is its ability to sustain the rhythmicity imposed by an external cue, even in the absence of the cue. To assess the role of KaiA in sustaining the endogenous periodicity, we compared the growth of the WT and the ∆ kaiA mutant subjected to different light-dark regimes followed by growth under CL (Fig. 2 ). When cells grown under different LD cycles (12:12, 16:8, 20:4 and 8:16) were transitioned to CL, the WT grown under any of the above conditions, maintained a strong periodicity for several days. In contrast, the oscillations observed in the mutant dampened significantly over time under CL and biomass accumulation was also significantly lower (Fig. 2a–d , Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Although reduction in biomass in the mutant was a common observation upon subjecting cells entrained under various LD conditions to CL, across multiple growth experiments various arrhythmic growth patterns were also observed, particularly under more extreme light regimes (20:4 LD and 8:16 LD) (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Fig. 2: Sustained endogenous rhythm of growth in Cyanothece 51142. Representative curves showing a comparison of the endogenous rhythms of the WT and ∆ kaiA strains grown under different LD regimes – 12:12 ( a ), 16:8 ( b ), 20:4 ( c ), and 8:16 ( d ) followed by CL growth. Representative growth curves from multiple runs of the WT and mutant are presented. The black bar represents a dark phase of growth. Full size image Deletion of kaiA affects nitrogenase activity To assess if the KaiA-controlled clock plays a role in the nitrogen fixation process in Cyanothece 51142, we compared nitrogenase activity in the WT and ∆ kaiA strains grown under different day-length conditions. When cells grown under 12:12 h or 16:8 h LD cycles were incubated under aerobic conditions, the average specific rates of nitrogenase activity in the ∆ kaiA mutant were not significantly different from that of the WT (Fig. 3a,b , Supplementary Table 1 ). Under 20:4 h LD and CL, the WT exhibited reduced rates of nitrogenase activity as compared to under 12:12 h LD growth conditions (Fig. 3c,d ). Nitrogen fixation rates in the mutant were greatly reduced ( ∽ 30% and 5% of WT) when cells grown under these conditions were aerobically incubated. Interestingly, when cells grown under longer day length conditions (16:8, 20:4, and CL) were incubated anaerobically, the ∆ kaiA mutant exhibited significantly higher rates of nitrogenase activity compared to the WT (Fig. 3 ). To assess if the reduction in nitrogenase activity in ∆ kaiA under aerobic incubation conditions was a result of reduced transcript levels of the nitrogenase genes, we performed qRT-PCR analysis of a few representative genes of the nif cluster. To our surprise, we observed significant upregulation of the nif genes (4 to 10 fold) in the ∆ kaiA samples collected from CL or LD (L2, D2, see methods) growth conditions (Supplementary Fig. 11a ). Analysis of transcript levels of genes involved in respiration, a process critical for nitrogen fixation also revealed significant upregulation in the ∆ kaiA mutant (Supplementary Fig. 11b ). Under 8:16 LD cycles, nitrogenase activity was significantly low in the WT compared to 12:12 LD conditions and the ∆ kaiA mutant showed rates ∽ 20% of the WT (Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Mutant cells grown under 8:16 LD cycles did not show any increase in nitrogen fixation rates even when incubated under anaerobic conditions (Fig. S 12 ). Fig. 3: Comparison of nitrogenase activity in the WT and ∆ kaiA strains of Cyanothece 51142. The activity of samples grown under different light regimes [12:12 ( a ), 16:8 ( b ), 20:4 ( c ), CL ( d )] is expressed as % WT activity under 12:12 LD growth. Error bars correspond to standard deviations from at least 3 biological replicates (12:12 LD, n = 4), (16:8 LD, n = 5) and (20:4 LD and CL, n = 3) The letters a , b denote statistically different values of μ for Air and c , d indicate statistical significance for Argon ( p < 0.05), while same letters a or c indicate that the difference in values of μ is insignificant ( p ≥ 0.05). Full size image The ∆ kaiA mutant exhibits disruption in cellular oxygen dynamics Since the significant reduction in nitrogenase activity in the mutant grown under CL or 20:4 LD cycles could be restored when an anaerobic incubation environment was provided, we hypothesized that the cellular oxygen dynamics were different between the WT and the ∆ kaiA mutant under these extended light periods. To test this hypothesis we monitored the dissolved oxygen (DO) levels of cultures grown under CL as well as cultures subjected to CL after entrainment under 12:12 h LD cycles. Intracellular oxygen levels cannot be measured and as such, studies that attempt to assess the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of cyanobacterial cells monitor dynamic changes in the DO levels of the culture medium 26 , 27 , 35 , 36 , 37 . In a closed culture system, the DO levels in the media fluctuate, increasing with oxygen evolution during the photosynthetic phase and decreasing with oxygen uptake during respiration. Under 12 h LD conditions both in the WT and the mutant the oxygen level showed a sharp decline at the beginning of the dark period and began to rise at the end of the dark period (Fig. 4 a,b ). When the entrained cells were subjected to CL, the WT maintained the sharp oscillations in the oxygen levels that coincided with the oscillations observed in OD 730, with the rise in oxygen coinciding with the rise in OD and vice versa (Fig. 4a , green arrows). However, in ∆ kaiA these oscillations rapidly dampened upon transition to CL and they did not strictly coincide with the oscillations in OD 730 (Fig. 4b , orange arrows). When grown under CL without any prior entrainment, the WT culture exhibited sharp oscillations in oxygen levels (Fig. 4c ). In contrast, in the ∆ kaiA mutant, little and random dips in oxygen levels were observed (Fig. 4d ,). In the WT nitrogenase activity could be detected in samples collected after the OD and oxygen levels began to dip (between D0 and D2, see methods) and at these time points quantum yields reflecting photosynthetic efficiency were low. In contrast, quantum yields were higher in samples that were collected after the OD and oxygen levels began to rise (between L0 and L2, see methods) and no nitrogenase activity could be detected in these samples. In contrast, only a weak correlation between nitrogenase and photosynthetic activities could be observed in the mutant at time points where drops and rises in OD and oxygen levels were discernable. Fig. 4: Cellular oxygen dynamics in the WT and ∆ kaiA strains. Rhythms in growth and DO levels coincide with external LD cycles (green arrow) in the WT ( a ) and ∆ kaiA ( b ). Rhythms are sustained in the WT after cells are transitioned to CL (green arrow) but not in the mutant (orange arrow). When grown under CL the WT ( c ) exhibits distinct endogenous rhythms in growth which coincide with oxygen cycling (green arrow). The rhythms are lost in ∆ kaiA ( d ) where only a few random drops in oxygen levels are seen (orange arrow). Representative data from multiple runs are presented. 3 independent datasets for growth under CL (showing variability) for the WT and mutant have been provided as raw data (Source Data). Full size image Analysis of DO level data from multiple runs revealed larger variations in absolute values among replicates of WT and ∆ kaiA . However, we observed very similar patterns of periodicity in the different WT and ∆ kaiA runs. For example, the WT had significantly larger fluctuations in the DO levels, and exhibited a clear oscillatory pattern (peaks and crests at constant intervals). In contrast, in the mutant, except for some random fluctuations observed during the experiment, DO levels remained mostly constant without any obvious oscillatory pattern (source data). We selected a representative sample from the WT and ∆ kaiA , with a mean DO% of around 9%, for quantitative analysis of the DO levels over the experiment. Our analysis revealed that DO% in the WT sample fluctuated in the range of 5.2% to 8.8% within an 8 h period on consecutive days of the experiment (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). However, for the ∆ kaiA mutant, we observed significant changes in DO% levels during only two windows in the entire duration of the experiment (2.5% and 6.1% on day3 and day4 respectively) and the DO% changed by less than 1% during the remaining days. As noted above, even though absolute values had larger variations among replicates, similar behaviors were observed in other samples of WT and the ∆ kaiA mutants. We assessed the photosynthetic and respiratory activities of cells fixing nitrogen in incubation bottles under aerobic incubation conditions. At the time point where the WT showed high rates of respiratory oxygen uptake (T6), the mutant did not, which instead exhibited higher photosynthetic oxygen evolution, indicating inability of the cells to shut off photosynthesis and initiate high rates of respiration during nitrogen fixation (Supplementary Fig. 14 ). Genes involved in photosynthesis showed no significant difference in expression in samples collected from the light phase (CL or L2 of a light dark cycle), but interestingly were significantly upregulated in the dark (D2) samples (Supplementary Fig. 11c ). Together, these results indicate that the switch controlling the shutdown of the photosynthetic phase and onset of the respiratory phase is malfunctional in the ∆ kaiA mutant, thereby disrupting its cellular oxygen dynamics. Instability of the nitrogenase enzyme in ∆ kaiA To determine if the altered cellular oxygen dynamics in the mutant affected the nitrogenase enzyme and its activity, we performed a western blot analysis of WT and ∆ kaiA samples undergoing aerobic and anaerobic incubation for nitrogen fixation. During incubation in sealed vials, nitrogen fixation rates continue to increase for upto more than 48 hours and start to plateau around 60 hours. We sampled cells of the WT and the mutant 24 hours after the start of aerobic or anaerobic incubation and performed a western blot with the total cellular protein. We used the anti-nifD antibody to probe the molybdenum-iron proteins of the nitrogenase enzyme complex and compared the protein levels between the different samples. Since the antibody showed multiple bands, we also expressed the NifD protein in E. coli and used the purified protein as a positive control. A comparison of the equal amount of total cellular protein between the WT and mutant revealed a strong NifD band in the WT under aerobic incubation conditions (Fig. 5 ). In comparison, the mutant showed a very weak band, indicating reduced protein levels in the cells. In samples incubated under anaerobic conditions, the NifD protein levels were similar in the WT and the mutant. These findings together with our observation that nitrogenase activity in the ∆ kaiA mutant is revived under anaerobic incubation conditions suggest that unfavorable oxygen levels in the cells grown under CL or long day cycles lead to degradation of the nitrogenase enzyme and lower nitrogen fixation rates. Fig. 5: Western blot analysis of the NifD protein in WT (A, C) and ∆ kaiA (B, D) cells grown under CL and incubated for nitrogen fixation assay in air (A, B) or argon (C, D). Total cellular protein was probed with NifD antibody. Experiments were independently repeated three times with similar results. Cyanothece 51142 NifD protein was expressed in E.coli and purified protein was used as a positive control (E). Arrow showing 54 kD NifD specific band in the samples.

Full size image Discussion Since the discovery of nitrogen fixation in unicellular cyanobacteria, various studies have implicated a circadian clock function in segregating this oxygen-sensitive process from photosynthesis. However, a direct involvement of the clock in orchestrating this segregation could not be demonstrated. In this first-of-its-kind study, we investigate the function of the circadian clock in a unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria, specifically probing the role of KaiA, the protein that was the latest addition to the prokaryotic circadian clock, supposedly conferring the most advanced features to it 9 , 38 . Compared to KaiB and C, KaiA has undergone major structural modifications likely induced by selective pressures from a changing environment over the course of cyanobacterial evolution, suggesting that it played a key role in shaping the functions of the clock 39 , 40 , 41 . WT Cyanothece cells exhibit prominent oscillations in optical density ( ∽ 24 hour period) when grown under CL and diazotrophic conditions, implying a strong circadian regulation of growth (Supplementary Fig. 3 , Figs. 1 , 2 ). A strong endogenous rhythm is also reflected in the robust oscillations in DO levels observed under these conditions (Fig. 4c ). Such conspicuous rhythms in physiological processes, driven by the internal clock are not evident in strains currently used as models to understand the circadian function 42 , 43 , 44 . Therefore, Cyanothece 51142 offers a much-awaited opportunity to directly explore the effects of the clock on the physiology of an organism. Since direct measurement of intracellular oxygen levels is not possible in cyanobacterial cells, changes in the DO levels of the culture are considered as a reflection of the changes in intracellular oxygen levels brought about by photosynthetic and respiratory activities of the cells 26 , 27 , 35 , 36 , 37 . Under CL and nitrogen-deficient conditions, the rhythmic rise and drop in OD and DO levels in the WT coincide and correspond with the photosynthetic and nitrogen fixation phases of the cells when oxygen evolution and respiratory oxygen uptake predominate respectively. The precise peaks and troughs in the DO levels in the absence of an external diel cue suggest the involvement of tight internal switches that control the rise and drop in oxygen levels at the cusp of nitrogen fixation and photosynthetic activities, thereby segregating the incompatible processes. Earlier studies have documented the importance of the rhythms in oxygen cycling in maintaining high rates of aerobic nitrogen fixation in unicellular cyanobacteria 26 , 27 . These oscillations denoting the segregation of the photosynthetic and respiratory phases of the cells are lost in the ∆ kaiA mutant, and instead, a few random dips in DO levels are seen (Fig. 4 ). qRT-PCR analysis revealed enhanced transcript levels of genes involved in respiration in the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 11b ). The mutant also exhibited respiratory oxygen uptake (Supplementary Fig. 14b ), suggesting that there are no intrinsic defects in its respiratory machinery and the disruption in oxygen cycling can most likely be attributed to a dysfunctional regulatory switch that stops photosynthesis and initiates high rates of respiration following metabolic cues. Along similar lines, a switch was shown to be involved in shutting off photosystem II when Crocosphaera Watsonii cells were required to fix nitrogen under light 29 . A switch was also implicated in a study in Cyanothece BG 043511, where regardless of the photoperiod, photosynthesis was turned off and nitrogen fixation was initiated 20 h after the onset of light 45 . The metabolic state of the cell has been suggested to be a factor responsible for entraining the phases of the internal clock in various systems 46 . In Cyanothece 51142, the availability of photosynthetically fixed carbon could possibly be a trigger for nitrogen fixation and depletion of the carbohydrate reserve along with the accumulation of cyanophycin, a nitrogen reserve, could be a cue for photosynthesis to start in the absence of external LD cues. Although the observed oscillations in Cyanothece may be triggered by metabolic cues, a role for KaiA in coordinating the processes is evident from the fact that the rhythms are abolished in the ∆kaiA mutant and are restored to WT levels upon re-introducing the kaiA gene. Under CL, nitrogenase activity in the WT is lower compared to growth under 12:12 or 16:8 h LD cycles (Fig. 3d ), and under this condition, the growth dynamics reflect phase separation of 16:8 h for photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation (rise and drop in OD) respectively, a rhythm the WT cells automatically resort to (Fig. 1a , S 3 ). This reflects the efficiency of the clock in segregating photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation so that an optimal C/N ratio conducive to robust growth can be maintained. Under light/dark cycles, on the other hand, the onset and cessation of photosynthesis is regulated strictly by the presence and absence of light signals 47 . At the end of the light phase, the termination of photosynthesis is a cue for the cells to prepare for nitrogen fixation. As a first step towards such preparation, cyanobacterial cells ramp up the rates of respiration utilizing glycogen granules that are photosynthetically synthesized during the day. Such high rates of respiration are responsible for scavenging the intracellular oxygen, preparing the cells for nitrogenase activity 26 , 27 . Thus, under 12:12 and 16:8 h LD growth conditions the rhythms in photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation are imposed by the external LD cycles (Fig. 2a,b ), thereby enforcing segregation of the processes, however in the absence of the day/night rhythm imposed by nature or under altered day length conditions, the internal clock function becomes critical in coordinating the processes. While nitrogen fixation rates are higher in the WT under 12:12 and 16:8 h LD conditions, no advantage in biomass accumulation is seen (Fig. 3a, b, d , S 7 ), indicating that the excess nitrogen is likely processed for storage, a necessity for cells to function under diurnal cycles but not under CL (Figs. 3 a,b, 1b ). The dampened or loss in oscillations of the ∆ kaiA mutant observed under CL or when LD-grown cultures were subjected to CL correlated with reduced nitrogenase activity. The activity could be revived and rates higher than the WT could be attained when cells were subjected to an anaerobic incubation environment. This suggests that the switch regulating the oscillations and the segregation of processes is controlled by KaiA and in the absence of this clock protein, ineffective segregation of photosynthesis from the nitrogen fixation phase of the cells results in suboptimal intracellular oxygen levels, causing damage to the nitrogenase enzyme and reduction in nitrogenase activity. This was further confirmed by our comparative analysis of the nitrogenase enzyme (NifD) levels in the WT and the mutant under aerobic and anaerobic incubation conditions (Fig. 5 ). In Synechococcus PCC 7942 it has been shown that inactivation of kaiA leads to damped, low-amplitude oscillations in gene transcription and the kaiBC promoter activity has been suggested to be responsible for retaining the basal level of oscillations 48 . Since we were unable to delete kaiC1 from Cyanothece 51142, we probed the effect of simultaneous deletion of kaiA and B1 on the clock function by generating a ∆ kaiAB1 double mutant. The ∆ kaiAB1 mutant resembles the phenotype of a ∆ kaiA mutant with a more stringent reduction in the amplitude of oscillations (Supplementary Fig. 15a, b ), Further analysis of the double mutant might provide clues for identifying the source of the residual rhythms observed in the ∆ kaiA mutant. Overall, these studies suggest a specific role for the KaiA-mediated circadian clock in timing physiological processes in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria that perform aerobic nitrogen fixation so that an optimal intracellular level of oxygen conducive to sustained nitrogenase activity can be maintained. Evolutionary studies imply an intricate link between the origin of kaiA and the evolution of aerobic diazotrophic cyanobacteria 9 , 49 . Evidence based on phylogenetic analysis suggests that cyanobacteria first emerged as anaerobic diazotrophs more than 3 billion years ago and subsequently evolved into microaerobic diazotrophs that relied on temporal separation of photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation 50 , 51 . An hourglass-type clock encoded by the kaiBC genes would have been a sufficient feature in anaerobic diazotrophs where protection of the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase enzyme was inconsequential (Fig. 6 , S 16 ). Such an hourglass-type clock that does not exhibit sustained rhythms in the absence of the entraining cue, but is essential for maintaining daily rhythmicity in nitrogenase activity, is observed in extant anaerobic nitrogen-fixing strains like Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas plaustris 52 , 53 . Some unicellular cyanobacteria also harbour the kaiBC operon suggesting that an hourglass-type clock could have been the time-keeping machinery in early cyanobacteria. KaiA has been suggested to be a cyanobacterial invention, possibly an addition to the hourglass type clock to initiate robust, sustainable rhythms in physiological processes (Fig. 6 ). This clock feature enabled cells to segregate oxygen-sensitive processes as they strived to adapt to increasing oxygen levels in the environment 53 . Interestingly, the evolution of the KaiA protein in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria has been linked to the oxygenation of the Metaproterozoic ocean around 1570–1600 Mya 38 . Alternatively, with the exception of G. violaceus PCC 7421 (which lacks all kai genes), KaiA is found in all extant cyanobacteria, including the phylogenetically ancient unicellular anaerobic nitrogen-fixing strains Synechococcus sp. JA-2-3B′a and JA-3-3Ab, implying an earlier time of kaiA origin 38 , 54 . While most strains have retained the gene, suggesting that it may confer an advantage in the present environmental scenario, some phylogenetically advanced ones indicate its likely dispensability. For example, Prochlorococcus , a non-diazotrophic marine cyanobacterial species that has undergone massive genome streamlining, harbors an hourglass type clock or possesses a truncated kaiA , indicating erosion of this gene from its genome 38 , 55 . Similarly, UCYN-A, a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial endosymbiont that has undergone genome reduction and lost its photosynthetic ability, only harbors the central oscillator KaiC 56 , 57 . These examples suggest that loss of the KaiA component of the clock may confer some advantages for strains that do not need to maintain robust self-sustaining oscillations. Such an advantage is perhaps reflected in the higher nitrogen fixation rates of the ∆ kaiA mutant under anaerobic incubation conditions, likely due to the relaxation of unknown metabolic regulations that the KaiA-mediated clock imposes. The conditional dispensability of the gene is reflected in the fact that there is no significant growth disadvantage in its absence under nitrogen-sufficient conditions (Supplementary Fig. 17 ). Fig. 6: Schematics showing the importance of KaiA in regulating cellular oxygen dynamics in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria. KaiA is essential for maintaining strong oscillations in oxygen levels which in turn is crucial for nitrogenase function. In the absence of KaiA the clock functions like a prokaryotic hour glass clock ( kaiBC clock) and exhibits little rhythmicity. Full size image In conclusion, our findings demonstrate a prominent role for the KaiA-mediated circadian clock in regulating the oxygen levels in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria, a function that is critical for their survival under aerobic, nitrogen-limited conditions. This regulation is likely mediated by a switch that responds to cellular metabolic cues and rapidly shuts off photosynthesis while simultaneously initiating high rates of respiration to scavenge intracellular oxygen, priming the cells for nitrogen fixation. Unlike Synechococcus PCC 7942, where the regulatory components of the cyanobacterial clock are well understood 32 , 48 , 58 , the regulatory features of the circadian system are completely unknown in unicellular diazotrophic cyanobacteria. A preliminary analysis of some of the key regulatory players, including rpaA , the master regulator of the circadian clock, revealed differential regulation in the ∆ kaiA mutant of Cyanothece 51142 (Supplementary Fig. 18 ). Elucidation of these regulatory pathways and their components will reveal unknown facets of circadian regulation, impacting research in various sectors including agriculture and health. Methods Culture conditions and media WT Cyanothece ATCC 51142 and the kai mutants were cultured in ASP2 medium 59 in shaking flasks (150 rpm) at 30 °C under 100 μmol photons m −2 s −1 white light and ambient CO 2 . WT and mutant strains were maintained on BG-11 agar plates under 100 μmol photons m −2 s −1 white light and ambient CO 2. For growth assays under nitrogen-fixing conditions and nitrogenase activity determination, WT and mutant cells were precultured in ASP2 medium with reduced nitrogen content (1.7 mM NO 3 − ) for 3 days under 100 μmol photons m −2 s −1 white light and ambient CO 2 . E. coli strains used in conjugation experiments were grown in LB medium with 200 rpm shaking at 37 °C. Generation of clock gene mutants To generate markerless, ∆ kaiA , ∆ kaiB1 , and ∆ kaiC1 mutants of Cyanothece 51142, we used the previously described CRISPR-Cpf1 technique 60 . Briefly, we used the pSL2680 vector as the base plasmid into which the gRNA sequences targeting the three kai genes were cloned to generate pSL2680-gRNA- kaiA , pSL2680-gRNA- kaiB1 , and pSL2680-gRNA- kaiC1 . Upstream and downstream regions ( ∽ 700 bp) of the three genes, that would serve as the repair templates, were then cloned into the above plasmids by Gibson Assembly 61 . The accuracy of the sequences cloned were confirmed by sequencing (Genewiz®, South Plainfield, NJ). The plasmids were maintained in E. coli strain XL1-Blue. The resultant plasmids were conjugated into WT Cyanothece 51142 following the method previously described 62 . Complete absence of the kaiA and kaiB1 genes from the genome of Cyanothece 51142 could be verified by PCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Initially 6 completely segregated colonies were tested for growth and five of those six clones exhibited consistency in the observed phenotypes. Two of these clones (#1 and #3) were included in our studies. In contrast to ∆ kaiA and B1 , our efforts to generate a kaiC1 mutant failed. Even after multiple rounds of streaking, the WT kaiC1 gene persisted in the genome leading to non-segregated lines of this mutant. Therefore, we took a more conventional approach and aimed to replace the kaiC1 gene with a kanamycin cassette by homologous replacement. The kanamycin-resistant colonies obtained after conjugation of this plasmid into the WT strain were subjected to very high antibiotic pressure (500 µg/mL) in liquid culture as well as on plates. However, we failed to obtain a completely segregated mutant. Similarly, our attempts to delete the entire kaiAB1C1 cassette using CRISPR (two sets of gRNA’s targeting kaiA and kaiC1 were used) and conventional techniques failed. However, we were able to generate a ∆ kaiAB1 strain using CRISPR with pSL2680 vector as the base plasmid into which gRNA targeting the kaiA gene was introduced and 700 bp upstream and downstream of the kaiA and kaiB1 genes respectively were used as repair templates. Three colonies from the ∆ kaiAB1 mutant were tested and exhibited consistent phenotypes. We also generated a ∆ kaiA’ complementation strain by introducing the WT kaiA gene into the deletion strain using CRISPR. Three colonies were tested for insertion of the kaiA gene and all three colonies were positive and showed similar growth patterns as the WT. Primers used for creating the various clock mutants as well as the complementation strain have been listed in Supplementary Table 2 . Growth assays For photoautotrophic growth, cells were added to fresh ASP2 − N media in glass tubes to a final volume of 60 ml with the optical density at 730 nm (OD730) between 0.1 and 0.2. Growth was continuously monitored for a period of 4–7 days (depending on the LD cycle used) using the MC1000 Multicultivator (Photon Systems Instruments, Czechia). The MC 1000 was set to maintain temperature at 37 °C and light intensity of 850 μmol photons m −2 s −1 during the growth period. Since under CL greater variability in oscillations was observed compared to LD conditions, more independent runs were performed under CL (raw data has been provided for 3 independent runs of the WT and 5 independent runs of the mutant as source data). After 96 h (CL and 12hLD growth) or 144 h (all LD to CL growth experiments) of growth 5 mL of culture of the WT and ∆ kaiA was harvested from each growth condition to quantify biomass. Cells were centrifuged at 5000× g and washed twice with sterile H 2 O. Whatman 0.7 μM GF/B glass microfiber filters (70 mm diameter) were weighed to obtain the filter weight. The washed cells were then added to the filter, and left to dry for 24 h at 60 °C. The filters with the dried cell mass were then weighed three times and the average weight of biomass was calculated. Single-factor ANOVA test was used to compare the total biomass accumulation of the two strains under different growth conditions, p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. Mathematical approach for discerning rhythmicity In order to mathematically model the growth data, we first removed small fluctuations in the measurements using a moving-average filter. We then employed exponential curve fitting to approximate the overall growth, which appears to saturate over time. Exponential curve can be represented using the equation “ \(y=a-b * \exp (-c * x)\) ”, where y is the growth measurement, and x is the time. The parameters “a” captures the maximum (saturating) growth level, “b” represents the difference between final and initial growth measurements and “c captures how fast samples reach the saturation level. The above curve was fitted to each of the samples for both WT and ∆ kaiA and the respective parameters were determined. To enhance the visibility of the cyclic patterns of the growth data as well as to perform quantitative analysis, we employed signal detrending. For this purpose, we subtracted the overall trend in the growth data from the actual measurements. The resulting detrended signal was analyzed using power spectrum density analysis. In order to identify the differences in the growth rates and the cyclic patterns of the growth data, we employed the Mann-Whitney U test to compare multiple samples of the WT ( n = 3) and the ∆ kaiA mutants ( n = 5). Whole-cell absorption and pigment quantification Cells growing under CL and LD conditions in multicultivators were sampled on day 2 (for CL cultures) or day 3 (for LD culture) and whole-cell absorption was measured using DW2000 (Olis, Inc., USA) in disposable plastic cuvettes with 1 cm pathlength. The whole-cell phycocyanin and chlorophyll contents were calculated from the absorption spectra using the formulae obtained from Arnon et al. 63 . Nitrogenase, Photosynthetic, and Respiratory Activity Measurements To determine the rates of nitrogen fixation 20 mL of culture (from a 2-d-old, CL or 3-d-old 12-h light/dark culture) was sampled at the beginning (at the onset of dark, D0 or 2 h into the dark period, D2) of the dark period (LD culture) or at the point when the OD 730 begins to drop (CL culture) from multi cultivators and transferred to air-tight glass vials (125 mL) and incubated in air under a light intensity of 100 μmol photons m −2 s −1 for 12 h. For anaerobic incubation, the glass vials were flushed with argon for 5 – 10 min. Nitrogenase activity of the cultures was determined using an acetylene reduction assay 64 and expressed in terms of the ethylene produced 27 . Ethylene that accumulated in the head space of sealed culture vials was withdrawn with an air-tight syringe and quantified using an Agilent 6890 N gas chromatograph equipped with a Poropak N column and a flame ionization detector using argon as the carrier gas (flow rate of 65 ml min −1 ), following the manufacturer’s instructions 27 . The temperature of the injector, detector, and oven were 150, 200 and 100 °C, respectively. Total chlorophyll a was extracted by methanol and quantified spectrophotometrically using an Olis DW2000 spectrophotometer (OnLine Instrument Systems, Inc., GA). At least 3 biological replicates and 5 technical replicates were included for the WT and the ∆ kaiA strains under each condition. Single-factor ANOVA test was used to compare the total biomass accumulation of the two strains under different growth conditions, p < 0.05 being considered statistically significant. The respiratory activities of the cells were measured in photobioreactors equipped with an integrated Mettler-Toledo Clark-type oxygen electrode 27 . The vented bioreactors were operated in stirring mode to evaluate the changes in dissolved oxygen concentration of the cultures from photosynthetic and respiratory activities of the cells. The cultures were transferred to the bioreactors at the beginning of the log phase of growth and studied in batch culture mode under stirring conditions for 6 days. Similar to our growth experiments, under CL greater variability was observed in the DO levels compared to LD growth conditions. Raw data for 3 representative runs of the WT and the mutant have been provided as a source data file. Photosynthetic oxygen evolution and respiratory oxygen uptake of cells were measured in samples from the incubation vials using a Clark-type electrode 27 , 65 at the beginning of the incubation period (T0) and 6 h after incubation (T6). Cyanobacterial cells were normalized on the basis of chlorophyll content to determine the quantum efficiency of the WT and mutant strains using the FL-200 dual modulation PAM fluorometer. To compare the changes in DO levels, we computed the mean DO% levels as well as the absolute changes in the DO% over the period. Analysis of gene transcripts 50 ml of WT and ∆ kaiA cells grown in multi cultivators under nitrogen fixing, CL or LD conditions were harvested at the cusp of the photosynthetic phase and nitrogen fixation phase (the point at which OD 730 begins to drop, figure) (if CL culture) or at L2 and D2 time points (if LD culture). Cells were either prepared directly for RNA isolation or subjected to incubation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in air-tight bottles and harvested after 1 h. Total RNA from each sample was isolated using RNAwiz reagent (Ambion, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and treated with RNase-free DNase I prior to cDNA synthesis using random primers (Invitrogen) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. qRT-PCR was performed in a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad), following the protocol described in 66 . A minimum of three replicates were performed for each of the samples. All primers used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table 3 . No-template reactions were used as negative controls. ΔCt was calculated by subtracting the Ct of the endogenous reference gene ( 16 s rRNA ) from the Ct of the genes under investigation. The relative changes in transcript levels of the genes were analyzed using the 2 −ΔΔCT method. To calculate ΔΔCt, the WT ΔCt was subtracted from the ΔCt of ∆kaiA . The fold change in expression of the ∆ kaiA genes was calculated according to 67 . Western blot analysis WT and ∆ kaiA cells (60 ml culture) grown under CL and nitrogen-fixing conditions were harvested at the cusp of the photosynthetic phase and nitrogen fixation phase (the point at which OD 730 begins to drop) and subjected to incubation under air and argon in air-tight bottles. Cells were harvested after 24 h of incubation in the bottles, after confirming nitrogenase activity in parallel experiments. Cells were washed and the pellet resuspended in 0.5 ml TG buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 10% glycerol) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) and DNAse I. 0.5-ml volume of sterilized, cold, acid-washed glass beads was added to the cells, and the cells were disrupted by vortexing (BioSpec Products). The mixture was allowed to settle and the supernatant was collected for centrifugation at 3000 × g , for 5 mins. The supernatant was collected and further subjected to 30 mins of centrifugation at 16000 X g. The final supernatant was transferred into a new tube and the total soluble protein was quantified using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Thermo Scientific). 10-µg (total) protein extract from each sample was separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (12.5% [wt/vol]) gel by electrophoresis. The NifD protein, expressed and purified as previously described 68 , was loaded at a concentration of 2 µg. Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) for western blot analysis. The anti-nifD antibody 69 , 70 was used at 1:2,000 dilution. Bands were visualized using chemiluminescence reagents (Millipore-Sigma) with a LI-COR Odyssey Fc (LI-COR Biotechnology) imager. 3 blots were generated from independent biological samples (3 each of WT and mutant) and a representative blot is presented in Fig. 5 .

Although the bioactive and physicochemical properties of cyanobacterial-based EPS are attractive, their commercial exploitation is limited by the high production costs. Bioprospecting and characterizing novel EPS-producing strains for industrially relevant conditions is key to facilitate their implementation in various biotechnological applications and fields. In the present work, we selected twenty-five Portuguese cyanobacterial strains from a diverse taxonomic range (including some genera studied for the first time) to be grown in diel light and temperature, simulating the Portuguese climate conditions, and evaluated their growth performance and proximal composition of macronutrients. Synechocystis and Cyanobium genera, from marine and freshwater origin, were highlighted as fast-growing (0.1–0.2 g L −1 day −1 ) with distinct biomass composition. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, showed a production of 0.3 and 0.4 g L −1 of released polysaccharides (RPS). These were found to be glucan-based polymers with high molecular weight and a low number of monosaccharides than usually reported for cyanobacterial EPS. In addition, the absence of known cyanotoxins in these two RPS producers was also confirmed. This work provides the initial steps for the development of cyanobacterial EPS bioprocesses under the Portuguese climate.

Additionally, significant research & development efforts are leveraging the current industrial production of these photoautotrophic factories into economically feasible applications 2 . Certain products, such as biopolymers (i.e. polymeric susbtances of natural origin), are still limited by the production cost and capacity when considered for bulk markets. There are, however, high added value markets, for particular applications where cyanobacteria/microalgae biopolymers can be successfully commercialized due to their specific physicochemical and/or bioactive properties 3 , 4 , 5 . The relevance of these biopolymers in the bio-economy can be hailed through technological improvements and the discovery of new photoautotrophic factories 1 . Thus, bioprospecting for industrially relevant conditions (e.g. light, temperature) is key for bioprocess development and cost reduction 6 , 7 . Cyanobacteria are a promising source of biopolymers in the form of polysaccharides, which are found intracellularly (e.g. glycogen) or extracellularly as exopolysaccharides (EPS) 8 , 9 , 10 . EPS are polysaccharide-rich exudates that stick to the cell wall's outer side. However, they also exist in the supernatant, not connected to the cell wall. Although the origin of these polysaccharides in the supernatant is not fully understood, evidence suggests that they have similar monosaccharides composition 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . However, these two phases are extracted differently and are distinguished as cell-bound polysaccharides (CPS) and released polysaccharides (RPS) 15 . These biopolymers have been intensively studied, and some showed interesting techno-functional properties 16 , 17 , 18 ; with bioactive properties such as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties 19 , 20 , 21 making them good candidates for high added-value products. A comprehensive review on the methodologies applied to bioprospecting cyanobacterial EPS showed common features: light and temperature profiles are set constant, and strains explored are predominantly from Nostocales and Oscilatoriales orders and Nostoc genus 15 . These studies showed that EPS content is a strain-specific trait. The biological diversity present in culture collections can be a source of raw material for the exploration of biotechnological applications 22 . The Blue Biotechnology and Ecotoxicology Culture Collection (LEGE-CC) is a biobank of cyanobacteria and microalgae. Currently comprises more than 700 non-axenic cyanobacterial strains, 80% isolated from Portuguese environments 23 . Bioprospecting under process-oriented conditions is a useful way to determine critical process factors and use them to discover adapted microbial resources, at the same time, get closer to industrial scenarios 6 , 24 . Portugal has pioneered microalgae production and commercialization in Europe, having the oldest production unit, and now this segment is well represented by several industrial and artisanal producers 25 . The Portuguese climate has compatible conditions with the ones necessary for the industrial production of cyanobacteria. In this context, non-axenic cyanobacterial strains have been screened for relevant industrial conditions to determine and characterize their potential as a source of EPS biopolymers and non-toxic biomass for biotechnological applications. For that, strains were initially evaluated regarding their productivity and protein content when grown in photobioreactors (PBR) simulating the central Portugal spring diel light and temperatures. Then, the biomass of most productive strains under these criteria were profiled for their proximate composition (protein, carbohydrates, lipids and ashes). Strains producing RPS were prioritized. Those were checked for the presence of cyanotoxins through the detection of genes involved in the biosynthesis of these known toxins through traditional molecular methods and confirmed through ESI–LC–MS/MS. Their polysaccharides were partially characterized through GC/MS-EI of trimethylsilyl- O-glycosides for monosaccharides composition and HPSEC-MALS for molecular weight estimation. Results LEGE-CC holds EPS producing strains A pre-screening of sixty-three cyanobacterial strains (data not shown) allowed the selection of twenty-five strains through the staining of neutral polysaccharides using Alcian blue formulation. A qualitative characterization of these twenty-five strains is presented in Supplementary Material (SM) Table S1 . Overall, neutral polysaccharides were mostly attached to the cellular structure, as CPS, while some had no closeness to the cyanobacterial cells, belonging to the RPS fraction. The identification of the selected strains (SM Table S2 ) shows high diversity among them, comprising five orders: Chroococcales (54%), Synechococcales (25%), Nostocales (13%), Chroococcidiopsidales (4%) and Oscillatoriales (4%). The study sample, shown in Fig. 1 , comprises cyanobacteria from diverse habitats: freshwater environment (81%), marine origin (15%) and terrestrial (4%). Figure 1 Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on 183 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences of cyanobacteria. Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421 and G. violaceus PCC 8105 were used as the outgroup. LEGE-CC strains used in this work are indicated in bold and with a black circle. The different colour segments represent strain placement at the order level following 26 . Bootstrap values over 50% are indicated at the nodes. Full size image Strain productivity under simulated Portuguese climate The selected strains of cyanobacteria were exposed to spring-simulated conditions, with a temperature range of 11–22 °C, a maximum light intensity of ~ 1200 µmol m −2 s −1 , and a day length averaged to 14 h. Twenty-one of the twenty-five strains were able to thrive on these culture conditions while four were excluded for not being capable of duplicating their biomass during the fifteenth-day cultivation, namely Chrocodiopsales cyanobacterium LEGE 14612, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 16638, Microcystis aeruginosa LEGE 91353, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17617. In addition, other five strains were excluded from the screening due to contamination by microflagelates around day eight of cultivation: Cyanobium gracile LEGE 09399, Geminocystis sp. LEGE 16574, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 18573, Pegethrix sp. LEGE 18685 and Synechocystis sp. LEGE 16643. In sum, nine of the twenty-five strains were excluded from the following steps. The combination of diel light and temperature directly affected the biomass productivity of cyanobacteria, as shown in Fig. 2 . Two virtual groups can be distinguished: a less productive group (< 0.10 g L −1 day −1 ) composed of nine strains and a more productive group (≥ 0.1 g L −1 day −1 ) consisting of seven strains. Interestingly, the most productive group is composed of all marine strains understudy, mostly belonging to Synechocystis and Cyanobium genera ( Synechocystis salina LEGE 000038, Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041, Synechocystis salina LEGE 06099, Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140) and three freshwater strains ( Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367, Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970). Among these, the highest biomass productivity was reached by the two Cyanobium strains (Fig. 2 ). Figure 2 Biomass productivity of cyanobacterial strains for the period of 15 days. Biomass productivity is expressed in g L −1 day −1 ± standard error (n = 3). Full size image The least productive group is represented by nine strains from Chroococcales (4), Synechococcales (2), Nostocales (3) and Oscilatoriales (1) orders, namely Synechocystis sp. LEGE 06079, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE 11397, Desmonostoc muscorum LEGE 12446, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17607, Altericista sp. LEGE 17690, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19969, Planktothrix sp. LEGE XX280, Nostocales cyanobacterium LEGE 18510 and Chalicogloea sp. LEGE 18580. Protein content Figure 3 shows the protein content of cyanobacterial biomass produced in the PBR, except for Chalicogloea sp. LEGE 18580, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE 11397 and Desmonostoc muscorum LEGE 12446, due to insufficient amount of biomass. Overall, the protein content of the cyanobacterial biomass varied from 20 to 40% dry weight (DW), and there were significant differences globally (Kruskal–Wallis test, chi-squared = 36.26; df = 12, p -value < 0.001). The post-hoc Nemenyi test found significant differences between the strain LEGE 19969 (the one with higher content, 43% DW) and both LEGE 06140 and LEGE 17690 strains (the two with lower content, 24% and 24.7%, respectively). Figure 3 Protein content in percentage of dry weight (DW) of the cyanobacterial strains. Different letters indicate significant differences between strains according to the Nemenyi post-hoc test. Values are given as means ± standard deviation ( n = 3 ). Full size image The correlation between biomass productivity and protein determined by the Spearman coefficient was negative but non-significant ( \(\rho\) = − 0.29; S = 12,790; p -value = 0.07). Biomass proximate composition of most productive strains The most productive cyanobacterial strains (four marine and three freshwater) were selected, and a full biomass proximate composition was carried out (Fig. 4 ). A Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) was applied in other to detect dissimilarity between strains (Fig. 5 ), presenting a stress value of 9.22 × 10 –5 . Figure 4 Biomass proximate composition of the most productive cyanobacterial strains ( n = 3 ). Full size image Figure 5 Plot of the non-metric multidimensional scaling for the biochemical composition of the seven strains. Full size image Protein content among these marine and freshwater strains varied from the highest proportions for Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 (41% DW) and the marine Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 (41%), whereas lowest content was observed for marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 (24% DW). Relative lipid content was lowest for marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 (8% DW) and highest for freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 (12% DW) (Fig. 4 ). Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038, LEGE 00041 and LEGE 06099) showed a similar total lipid content (11–12% DW), whereas Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed only 10% DW of total lipids. Ash content for marine strains varied from 10.5% DW ( Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140) to 24.3% DW ( Synechocystis salina LEGE 00038), while among freshwater strains, ash content varied from 5% ( Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611) to 6.9% DW (Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970). Carbohydrate content was highest for marine Cyanobium sp. (LEGE 06140), representing almost 60% DW, while the lowest value was found for Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 (28.1% DW). Interestingly, freshwater strains averaged higher carbohydrates than marine ones. Additionally, the marine Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 and freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 showed very similar levels of carbohydrate accumulation: 57% DW and 54% DW, respectively. The three Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038, 00041 and 06099) showed varying carbohydrate levels (28–39% DW). Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 registered almost even proportions of carbohydrates and protein. The NMDS analysis (Fig. 5 ) showed the biomass composition of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 and Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 were very similar, with an overlap in their positions (Fig. 5 ). These two strains are associated with high relative protein and lipid content (Fig. 4 ). Also, Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 was associated with these two components, but its higher ash content showed a displacement towards this component in the first dimension (Fig. 5 ). Synechocystis salina strain LEGE 00038 was characterized by its relatively high ash content (Fig. 4 ) and appeared associated to it (Fig. 5 ), Synechocystis salina LEGE 06099 showed the most balanced proportion of all the elements, being the closest to the origin (Fig. 5 ). Cyanobium strains LEGE 15611 and LEGE 06140 were associated with carbohydrates, since they had the largest proportion (Fig. 4 ). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was built to explore the relationships between the biochemical composition of the most productive strains (Fig. 6 ). Results of the PC1 explain 65.5% of the total variance. This component was negatively correlated with carbohydrate content and positively with protein, lipid and ash content. The PC2 axis explains 22.3% of the total variance, mostly positively correlated with lipid and protein, and negative with ash. The most remarkable pattern was the negative association between carbohydrate content and all the other components. The PC1 showed the characterization of strains LEGE Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611 and Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06140 showed a higher relative carbohydrate content with respect to all other strains; the first was relatively richer in lipids and proteins whereas the second was poorer in lipids and proteins and richer in ash. Synechocystis salina LEGE 00041 was more correlated to lipids and proteins. The PC2 confirmed two groups with opposed patterns regarding lipid and protein on one side and ash on the other. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 were richer in proteins and lipids, and Synechocystis salina strains (LEGE 00038 and 06099) were richer in ash. Figure 6 PCA of biochemical components for the most productive cyanobacterial strains. Full size image Partial characterization of RPS Neutral polysaccharides at the end of cultivation were stained and microphotographed as shown in Fig. 7 . The marine cluster of microphotographs showed a similarity between the EPS staining composed of Synechocystis salina strains. Contrarly, the freshwater Cyanobium strains showed a difference between the connection of cells and EPS fractions. Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 showed a layer of mucilage surrounding its cells while the one of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed what we could distinguish between RPS and CPS. EPS production in the form of RPS was only detected for two freshwater strains, Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. The volumetric and massic raw RPS yield was higher for the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, as shown in Table 1 . Figure 7 Microphotographs of cyanobacterial EPS after PBR cultivation stained with Alcian Blue formulation clustered by origin. Magnification ranged from 100 to 400× and was adapted to cell size to capture the main profile of EPS around the cells.

Full size table Monosaccharides composition The compositions in monosaccharides of cyanobacterial RPS from Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 were carried out using GC/MS-EI (SM Figure S2 ). The molar % of monosaccharides detected in the cyanobacterial RPS are shown in Table 2 . Both RPS samples are glucose-rich, indicating the nature of these polysaccharides to be glucan-based, with other neutral sugars. The RPS of Synechocystis sp. is composed of four main monosaccharides Glucose (Glc), Galactose (Gal), Rhamnose (Rha) and Mannose (Man), while traces (molar % < 1%) of Xylose (Xyl), Fucose (Fuc) and Ribose (Rib) were detected. The RPS of the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 presents in the same way four main monosaccharides Glc, Rha, Gal and Man with traces of Xyl and Fuc. Table 2 Monosaccharides composition of cyanobacterial RPS. Full size table Molecular weight (Mw) distribution The Mw distribution of the RPSs was determined by HPLC-SEC/MALS analysis, experiments were carried out in 0.1 mol L −1 NaNO 3 (SM Figure S3 ). The polysaccharides were eluted between 16 and 23 mL which are typical range for high molecular weight fractions and exhibited distinct elution profiles. Effectively, the LS signal of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 does not return to the initial level at the end of the elution, which indicates a tailing phenomenon of the compound analyzed, unlike the RPS of Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. Thus, this indicates non-ideal elution, characterized by slow elution of molecules regardless of their hydrodynamic volume which can affect the separation of entire molecular weight in the samples. In order to improve the dissolution of RPS, different parameters were tested (concentration, temperature, high homogenization). The concentration detector (refractive index detector) and the dn dc −1 used (0.150) allowed to calculate the samples recoveries compared to the original mass of the injected sample. Sample recoveries obtained from Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 was lower (< 10%) than Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 (around 30%). Filtration of the sample through a small pore size filter (≤ 0.45 μm) may result in sample loss in the case that high molecular weight RPS may be present as aggregates. These low recoveries might also be due to material loss caused by sample adsorption due to interaction with the column packing material, as suggested by the LS signal. A summary of the Mw distribution of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19,970 RPS is shown in Table 3 . Both RPS presented a polydispersity index of the same magnitude. The average Mw of the RPS of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 is higher than Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 RPS. A subtle UV signal was detected in the RPS fractions of both cyanobacteria (data not shown). Table 3 Average Mw, polydispersity index (D) and Mw distribution of cyanobacterial EPS. Full size table Cyanotoxin detection Cyanobacterial toxins were evaluated for both RPS-producing strains (Table 4 ). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection was carried out for six genes associated with the biosynthesis of four cyanotoxins (Microcystin, Saxitoxin, Cylindrospermopsin and Anatoxin). Although no genes were detected for both freshwater strains, the stx gene was initially detected for Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367. Sequencing of the amplified PCR product did not correspond to the saxitoxin-related gene. To conclude the absence of this toxin, an ESI–LC–MS/MS analysis was carried out for both biomass and supernatant of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 culture. STX standard solution showed a retention time (RT) of 3.25 min and mass fragments of 282, 266, 240, 221, 204 and 144 m/z (Figure S4 ). The Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 cell extracts and media total ion chromatograms were analyzed in the LC signal region with RT 2–10 min and all the collison induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrum did not show the fragment pattern expected for STX or Neosaxitoxin (Figure S4 C–F). Together, the evidence supports the absence of STX and Neosaxitoxin in the cells and media of Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367. Therefore, both freshwater strains are free of known cyanotoxins.

Full size table Discussion This study has explored a novel way in bioprospecting EPS producing strains by subjecting them to industrially relevant conditions (diel light and temperature). A screening study comprising rich biodiversity was carried out in the Roscoff Culture Collection, with five different orders explored, broadening the knowledge of cyanobacterial RPS producers under constant light and temperature. Synechococcus sp. RCC 2380 was highlighted as a RPS-producing strain showing a fair productivity of 4 mg L day −1 27 . Our study contributed to increase the screened taxonomic diversity over five orders from several genera. When bioprospecting EPS producing strains reports have consistently focused on EPS as single product 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 while some included biomass production 34 , 35 , 36 and few biochemical parameters 37 . Using diel light and temperature to simulate real climate is crucial to address the industrial implementation of these photoautotrophic factories 38 . Understanding which strains adapts better to these conditions can help to reduce energy input for process control. For that, biomass productivity is a valuable metric to assess the potential of these strains. Spirulina sp. LEB-18 RPS-producing when grown in a 250L raceway tank showed peak biomass productivity of 0.02 g L −1 day −1 39 . Our study showed maximal biomass productivities around 0.2 g L −1 day −1 however, these are expected to lower when volume of cultivation increases. Harnessing other valuable metabolites beyond EPS can provide multi-product from one single cultivation and valorise the overall bioprocess. Some studies have explored EPS and pigments 40 , 41 or the production of bioethanol 42 . Our study has focused on the macromolecular composition of the biomass which provides a general overview of each cyanobacteria biochemical profile. Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06133 has been highlighted as a rich source of pigments (phycobiliproteins and carotenoids) with a biomass productivity of 0.14 g L −1 day −1 under optimized conditions 43 . The two most productive Cyanobium strains, showed higher biomass productivity than the one grown in optimized conditions. The other most productive strains screened in this work belong to the Synechocystis genus. Synechocystis salina has been reported as a valuable source of antioxidant molecules 44 and polyhydroxyalkanoates 45 , making them potential candidates for a biorefinery concept 46 . The demand for alternative protein sources is rising, and cyanobacteria are in the spotlight as one of them 47 . The present study evaluated the protein content of the following genus for the first time: Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 17607, Altericista sp. LEGE 17690, Synechococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19969, Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, Tolypothrix sp. LEGE XX280 and Nostocales cyanobacterium LEGE 18510. Our studied strains had relatively lower protein content in comparison to other well-studied cyanobacterial genera, namely Anabaena (43–56% DW), Arthrospira (17–72% DW), Aphanizomenon (62% DW), Synechococcus (46–63% DW) 48 . Although there are different routine methodologies for protein quantification (nitrogen analysis, colorimetric assays, and sum of anhydroamino acids), inconsistencies have been shown between the results obtained with one or the other, so conclusions about the actual protein content must be careful 48 . The model cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has a reported protein content varying from 32 to 57% DW 49 , similar to that found for Synechocystis strains (34–40% DW). The Cyanobium sp. LEGE 06113 was characterized by low protein content 50 , following the one here obtained for the Cyanobium strains. The most productive strains showed similar lipid content. Nordic freshwater cyanobacteria grown under synthetic wastewater showed similar total lipid content (6.7 and 23.5% DW) 51 . The freshwater Cyanobium sp. CACIAM06 showed 5.5% DW of lipid content 52 , lower than the one observed for the freshwater Cyanobium sp. LEGE 15611. The different ash content obtained for marine strains compared to freshwater strains is related to the higher concentration of salts in the marine medium. Carbohydrate accumulation is thought to work as a carbon sink from photosynthesis whenever nutrient-depleted conditions occur. In addition, under non-depleted nutrient conditions, cyanobacteria can be composed of low carbohydrate content (10–30% DW) 53 . Our results showed 5 out of 7 cyanobacteria with carbohydrate content higher than 30% DW, whereas the other two have levels near this virtual maximum, indicating that the cultures might be at the end of the growth phase in nutrient-depleted conditions. In the present work, a higher average % DW of carbohydrates was found for freshwater strains in comparison with marine strains. However, there is not enough bibliography to discuss this aspect. The NMDS stress value was considerably low, indicating a very good fit. This is probably due to the relatively low number of objects in the analysis and dimensions to establish the dissimilarities. As a result, the reduction to a 2-dimensional dissimilarity plot is very simple and robust. The PCA analysis showed a negative correlation between carbohydrate and protein content. A previous study on cyanobacterial biomass have found similar results 54 . The negative correlation between carbohydrate and lipid content was described for seven cyanobacteria strains, which agrees with previously obtained results 55 , 56 . To date, no study has explored the correlation between lipid and protein content in cyanobacteria, whereas our study indicates this positive correlation for both strains of marine and freshwater environments. Our NMDS are in accordance with the PCA correlation observed. The carbohydrate levels obtained in this study correspond to intracellular carbohydrates and CPS since biomass harvest did not undergo any washing step. Thus, we can assume that Cyanobium sp. strains (LEGE 06140 and LEGE 15611) are either rich in intracellular carbohydrates or CPS. Depending on their location, these carbohydrates could be feedstock for bioenergy purposes 57 or, in the case of CPS, the production of extracts for cosmetics or cosmeceuticals 58 . The EPS detection method employed in this work has been frequently applied to detect cyanobacterial EPS 59 , 60 , 61 . As observed in the microphotographs there is not a clear distinction between the RPS-producing strains and the non producing strains, since this stain is not molecular weight specific lower sizer fractions can be also stained however, the methodology applied in this work targets high molecular weight. Therefore, the staining approach among the most productive strains served as an indicator of the EPS architecture involving the cyanobacterial cells. Cyanobacteria rich metabolism allows the use of different nutrient sources which affect their physiology and performance 56 . The use of extract sea mud in a f/2 modified media promoted an EPS productivity of 1.3 g L −1 day −1 on Cyanothece genus strain however, no insights into biomass productivity or composition was mentioned 30 . Despite the surprising EPS productivity the impact on the use of this resource at large scale must be considered. Some of the most studied cyanobacteria for EPS production were grown under diazotrophic conditions 28 , 31 , 33 , 36 . Diazotrophic conditions promoted higher RPS productivities than the ones obtained in this study namely for axenic cultures of Nostoc sp. PCC 7413 and Nostoc sp. PCC 8109 around 47 mg L −1 day −1 and 30 mg L −1 day −1 , respectively 28 . The absence of nitrogen source can have a huge economical impact on nutrients associated costs however, the sensitivity of nitrogenase enzyme to oxygen is a factor affecting the growth rate of cyanobacterial biomass and must be addressed at a strain specific level before considering industrial exploitation 62 . Our study screened non nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria from a broad range of cyanobacterial orders using an industrial optimized version of f/2 media. This formulation is expected to be cost competitive in comparison to more complete versions of cyanobacterial growth media. The RPS productivities under Portuguese climate were considerably higher when compared to those obtained from representants of Nostocales, Chroococcales, Synechococcales, Oscillatoriales, Spirulinares Pleurocapsales orders which were mostly grown under stable light and temperature conditions 27 , 29 , 32 , 34 , 35 , 37 , 63 . Both obtained RPS are glucan-based, in accordance with EPS composition described for cyanobacteria 64 . However, no uronic acid was detected, which represents a less common trait found in these EPS 9 , 65 . Two common uronic acids (GlcA and GalA) were used as standards with a detection limit of 0.5 µg µL −1 , which should be enough to detect their presence. Less common uronic acids could be expected from cyanobacteria, so further experiments are required to confirm the absence of these sugar acids. Performing a reducing step prior to derivatization with TMS, NMR 13C, or ionic chromatography without derivatization are some of the techniques to be applied. Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 showed four main monosaccharides, among which 80% were glucose and rhamnose, suggesting the presence of a Rhamnoglucan RPS. These two monosaccharides have been described to be ubiquitous in cyanobacterial EPS 64 . Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 monosaccharides composition has shown a distinct composition when compared to Synechocystis PCC 6803 and PCC 6714 despite glucose was a major monosaccharide, a total of 11–12 monosaccharides and uronic acid were identified 66 . PCC 6714 RPS had a glucose content more similar to Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS. Additionally, the wild type of PCC 6803 was shown to have more balanced amounts of hexoses, while derived mutants have shown increasing amounts in hexoses, particularly of glucose which seems to be closer to the RPS composition of LEGE 07367 67 , 68 . Genetic differences between these strains or the culture conditions applied could be responsible for the observed variability in monosaccharides composition. Average molecular weight found for both RPS are within the ranges described for cyanobacterial EPS 69 . Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS average molecular weight is in agreement with the molecular weight proposed for Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 70 . A smaller RPS fraction was found for the Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970 averaging 636 kDa. The absence of a purification step for Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 RPS could influence the polydispersity index. The conductivity and salinity parameters of the RPS were suitable for monosaccharides analysis and thus, a broader estimated range of molecular weight was obtained. Mota and collaborators 18 have observed that the RPS from Cyanothece CYY010 has a diverse relative abundance whereas most polymeric fractions ranged from 50 kDa to 343.2 Da, yet 30% of the RPS fraction contained MDa size polymers. The diversity on monosaccharides and number of molecular weight fractions clearly indicate the complexity of the RPS. In addition, these structural features found can be affected by the extraction methodologies and the analytical methods applied 9 , 71 . Purification steps can help to hinder the structures of these polysaccharides and better understand how related to each other they are. The proteic moieties detected in both RPS fractions is commonly described in cyanobacterial RPS 9 , 72 . Cyanotoxins are responsible for negatively impacting the ecosystems, however, they could also be a high added value product for standards market or biomedical applications 73 . Some Synechocystis strains were found to be potent neurotoxin and hepatotoxin producers 74 . However, in strain Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 the absence of cyanotoxins was confirmed, as well as in strain Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970. This positions their interest for certain biotechnological applications. Certainly, process-oriented screenings of unexplored cyanobacterial strains will play a role in the implementation of cyanobacteria-based bioprocess for the biotechnology sector in Portugal. Conclusions The screening of cyanobacteria using diel light and temperature of Portuguese climate allowed to distinguish strains from a rich taxonomic group according to their performance, biomass composition, ability to excrete polysaccharides and produce cyanotoxins. Two cyanotoxin-free cyanobacterial strains, Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07367 and Chroococcales cyanobacterium LEGE 19970, were identified as fast growing (0.14 and 0.12 g L −1 day −1 , respectively) sourcing soluble glucan-rich RPS of high molecular weight 2910 kDa and 636 kDa, respectively. Their biomass composition rich carbohydrates (> 42% DW) and in protein (> 36% DW) hold potential for a wide range of applications. Fast-growing yet non-RPS-producing strains [ Synechocystis salina (3) and Cyanobium strains (2)] should be considered for the biorefinery concept due to their rich carbohydrate and/or protein content, which together accounted for 65–83% DW. This work provides an entry point for future outdoor cultivation of cyanobacteria with natural sunlight and reduced temperature control. The LEGE-CC showed its potential as a source of unexplored diversity, after the detection of potentially new genera of cyanobacteria, including one RPS producer. Materials and methods Strains pre-selection and cultures maintenance Sixty-three cyanobacterial strains were provided by LEGE-CC. At this point strains were kept under culture collection conditions and evaluated through light microscopy with Alcian Blue staining for neutral polysaccharides 34 . Briefly, strains (stationary phase) were kept under a 12/12 h Light/Dark cycle (L/D), light intensity < 20 µmol m −2 s −1 (fluorescent light, Acardia),19 °C, and maintained in a strain-dependent culture media: Z8 medium 75 , Z8 medium supplemented with 25‰ synthetic sea salts (salt Tropical Marin, Berlin, Germany) and 1‰ with vitamin B12 75 or BG11 0 76 Cultures and Alcian blue formulations were mixed in a 1:1 ratio, and using a Leica DMLB light microscope coupled to a Leica ICC50 HD digital camera (Leica Microsystems, Germany), the presence of neutral polysaccharides was observed. Then, the twenty-five strains were adapted to Allmicroalgae’s industrial medium, based on Guillard’s F/2 medium 77 , containing 10 mM of nitrogen and 12.5 mM of iron. Cultures were kept at 25 °C, 18/6 h L/D cycle, 10–30 µmol m −2 s −1 . Marine strains were grown under the same medium but supplemented with magnesium water and NaCl to reach salinity of 30 g L −1 . DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and sequencing Genomic DNA was extracted using the Genomic DNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions for Gram-negative bacteria. The 16S rRNA gene sequence (specific primer pairs available in SM Table 3 ) was obtained upon PCR amplification following the same conditions 78 . The sequencing was performed at GATC Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany), and the nucleotide sequences obtained were manually inspected for quality and assembled using the Geneious Prime 2021.2.2 software (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand). Sequences were checked for possible chimera formation using the DECIPHER software 79 before any phylogenetic analysis. Sequences obtained were inserted in the BLASTn (Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool for Nucleotides) database, and the results were analyzed. The sequences associated with this study were deposited in the GenBank database under the accession numbers OR046505 to OR046517. Phylogenetic analysis A total of 183 sequences were used in the final analysis, including 2 strains of Gloeobacter violaceus as outgroup, 159 sequences of cyanobacteria including type and reference strains retrieved from GenBank (National Center for Biotechnology Information, NCBI, Bethesda, MD, USA), and 22 sequences of LEGE-CC strains 23 . Multiple sequence alignment was constructed using MAFFT v7.450 80 , 81 and sequences were manually proofread and edited. The best substitution model for ML-based analyses was chosen using jModelTest 2 software 82 using the Akaike information criterion. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was carried out using the substitution model GTR + G + I with 1000 bootstrap resampling replicates using the IQ-TREE 2 software 83 . The final phylogenetic tree was edited on iTOL (Interactive Tree of Life) 84 and Inkscape 1.2 85 . Experimental set-up and photobioreactor operation Prior to cultivation in PBR, strains were placed in an orbital shaker SHK-2013 (100 rpm) for 7 days ALGAETRON AG230 (PSI Instruments) illuminated with cool white LED at 70 µmol m −2 s −1 and 22 °C under 18:6 L/D cycle. PBR cultivation was carried out in ALGEM systems (Algenuity, UK) with 25 (v/v %) inoculum, comprising 0.2 L cultivation volume. ALGEM features a geographic environment modelling that can be used to precisely simulate a specific environment. The location of Allmicroalgae S.A. production plant (39.652936 N, − 8.988986 W), was used as virtual site of experimentation, while diel light and temperature for the month of May simulated spring. The pH was set to 8 and controlled on demand through the injection of a 30% CO 2 –air mixture. Agitation was set constant at 100 rpm, and no aeration was provided. Cultivation was carried out for 15 days, and samples were taken every 2 or 3 days for culture monitoring. Biomass harvest and supernatant processing Biomass harvest was carried by centrifugation (Herareus Megafuge 16R, Germany) at 15000 g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored for further analysis. The supernatant was then subjected to a second centrifugation step at 18,000 g for 20 min at 4 °C, to remove persistent biomass and remaining cell debris. Thereafter, the supernatant was precipitated in cold ethanol at 3:1 (v/v %) and kept overnight under − 20 °C. A mesh and a strainer were used to recover the precipitate, which was then dried and stored. Cyanobacterial growth performance Biomass productivity was calculated from biomass concentration obtained on days two and fifteen. Briefly, the biomass concentration was determined by dry cell measurements carried under mild vacuum filtration. Ammonium bicarbonate (0.5 M) was used to wash the GF/F glass microfibre filters (Whatman). Filters (F) were previously dehydrated at 60 °C for at least 24 h proceeded by silica chambers for 1 h, before (F1) and after (F2) biomass retention. Dry cell weight corresponding to biomass concentration was obtained in g L −1 and calculated according to Eq. 1 . Biomass productivity was calculated according to Eq. 2 . $$Biomass\;concentration\;C_{x} \left( {\frac{{\text{g}}}{{\text{L}}}} \right) = \frac{F2 - F1}{{Volume\;of\;culture}}$$ (1) $$Biomass\;productivity\;R_{x} \left( {\frac{g}{L \cdot day}} \right) = \frac{{\Delta C_{x} }}{days\;of\;cultivation}.$$ (2) Biomass proximate composition Protein content was estimated for the fifteen strains that grew under the simulated environment by CHN elemental analysis, according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer, using a Vario el III (Vario EL, Elemental Analyzer system, GmbH, Hanau, Germany). The final protein content was determined by multiplying the percentage of nitrogen by 5.22 86 . Lipid, ash and carbohydrate contents were only estimated for the most productive strains. The lipid content was estimated using the Bligh & Dyer method 87 described in with minor modifications 88 . Briefly, freeze dried cyanobacterial samples (7–35 mg) were mixed with ~ 0.6 g of glass beads and extracted with methanol through bead-milling using a Retsch MM 400 mixer mill at 30 Hz for 3 min. The tubes were centrifuged (10,000 g), and the supernatants were collected to new vials. The pellets suffered a second extraction, and both methanol supernatants were pooled. Chloroform and water were added to the methanol (2:1:2), and the samples were vortexed for 5 min. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (2500 g for 10 min) to obtain a biphasic system, and the lipid extract (chloroform) was separated. A known volume of the extracts was transferred to pre-weighed tubes, evaporated and weighted in order to determine the lipids gravimetrically. The ash content was determined by burning the freeze-dried biomass (approximately 35 mg) in a furnace (J. P. Selecta, Sel horn R9-L, Barcelona, Spain) at 550 °C for 6 h 89 . The carbohydrate content was determined by difference of the remaining macronutrients. RPS purification Raw RPS samples were purified when necessary, using ultrafiltration membranes (cut-off 50 kDa) by using AMICON Ultra-4 Centrifugal Filter Unit. Briefly, raw RPS samples were solubilized in ultra-pure water and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm and room temperature. Conductivity and salinity were followed (HANNA Instruments) to track the presence of salts. When a 0.2% (w/v) RPS solution exhibited low conductivity (< 500 µS cm −2 ), it was considered appropriate for further analysis. RPS partial characterization Monosaccharides composition Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) by Eletrocnic Impact (EI) was used to determine the monosaccharides composition. Briefly, 1 mL of 2 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) was used for the dissolution of 10 mg of RPS. The hydrolysis step was performed with a thermoblock at 120 °C for 90 min followed by solvent evaporation under Nitrogen atmosphere at 60 °C. Trimethylsilylation derivatization method was performed as proposed by.Pierre and collaborators 90 , 91 . L-Rhamnose (L-Rha), L-Fucose (L-Fuc), L-Arabinose (L-Ara), D-Xylose (D-Xyl), D-Mannose (L-Man), D-Galactose (D-Gal), D-Glucose (D-Glc), D-Glucuronic acid (D-GlcA), D-Galacturonic acid (D-GalA), D-Glucosamine (D-GlcN), and D-Galactosamine (D-GalN) were used as standards. The samples were injected on a Shimadzu Nexus Gas Chromatrography 2030 system coupled to a GCMS-QP2020NX (Shimadzu, Japan), equipped with an OPTIMA-1MS Accent column (Macherey–Nagel, 30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm. Hydrogen flow rate was set at 1.75 mL min −1 . (7.8 psi). The first temperature ramp was set to 100 °C during 2.75 min then an increase until 200 °C was achieved at 8.4 °C min −1 . The second temperature ramp was raised until 215 °C during 0.95 min at a constant pace. The electronic ionization (EI, 70 eV) was carried at 150 °C, and the target ion was fixed at 40–800 m/z. The solvent cut time was set at 5 min, the split ratio was 50:1, and the temperature of the injector was 250 °C. The relative molar proportions were determined according to the area normalization. MestReNova Software 7.1.0–9185 (Mes-trelab Research, Coruña, Spain) was used to analyze the data. Mw estimation High pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) coupled with three detectors: Multi-angle laser light scattering detector (MALS, Mini-DAWN TREOS II, Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA), differential refractive index (DRI) detector (RID-10 A, Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) and UV–vis detector (SPD-20A, Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) were used to determine molecular weight of the samples. The HPSEC line consisted of an SB-G guard column and three columns in series (SB-806 HQ, SB-804 HQ and SB-803 HQ). The system was eluted with NaNO 3 0.1 M and NaN 3 2.5 mM, filtered through a 0.02 µm, 47 mm membrane filter (Anotop 47, Whatman, Maidstone, England), and carefully degassed. RPS samples were previously prepared by stirring in the elution buffer for at least 24 h at 60 °C and homogenized in Ultraturrax at 19,000 rpm for 20 s. Lastly, samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Grace Altech, Maryland, USA). Injection was carried through a 100 µL full loop and the elution was performed with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min −1 . Data were evaluated using ASTRA 7.2.2 software. Cyanotoxin detection Molecular methods The cyanotoxin detection was carried by molecular methods. Genomic DNA was obtained as in “ DNA extraction, amplification (PCR) and sequencing ” section. Genes mcyE, mcyA, were targeted for microcystin (MCs) and nodularin (NOD) production potential, sxtA, sxtG and sxtI for saxitoxin (STX), and cyrJ cylindrospermosin (CYN) and anaC-gen for anatoxin (ANA) using specific primer pairs available in SM Table 3 . Extraction, SPE and ESI-LC–MS/MS analysis Both cells and media were analyzed by ESI–LC–MS/MS to chemically confirm the Synechocystis sp. LEGE 07,367 toxicity of the Saxitoxin positive molecular outcome. Cells (fresh pellets) were collected after centrifugation, separated from the media (lyophilized) and extracted with some modifications 92 . The cells were dissolved in 15 mL of a methanolic solution (MeOH:H 2 O, v/v 20:80), sonicated to lysis (ice, 95% amplitude, 5 min) and centrifuged (5000 g, 4 °C, 2 min). This extraction was repeated twice, and all the supernatants were pooled together prior complete rotavapor dryness of the methanol. Both cell extracts and lyophilized media were resuspended in 200 mL of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade) before being submitted to solid phase extraction using Supelclean ENVI-carb cartridges (250 mg, 6 mL, SUPELCO, Sigma-Aldrich, USA). ENVI-carb cartridge was wetted with 6 mL of dichloromethane (DCM), 6 mL of MeOH, and 6 mL of ultrapure water (LC–MS grade). Samples (200 mL) were loaded at ~ 10 mL min −1 via a 12-port vacuum manifold (Waters, USA). Cartridges were then blown dry under nitrogen, eluted with 10 mL 60:40 MeOH:DCM (0.5% formic acid) into 15 mL glass test tubes and dried under vacuum with a rotary evaporator. Final extract was then reconstituted with 500 µL 10:90 H 2 O:MeOH (0.1% formic acid) and transferred to a 1.5 mL vial for LC–MS/MS analysis. Samples were injected in a Liquid Chromatograph Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC System (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA), coupled with a Mass Spectrometry LCQ Fleet™ Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA). The program used for data acquisition and processing is XcaliburTM version 2. Mass Spectrometer Tune Method parameters optimization was performed thought direct injection of a Saxitoxin standard (CRM-00-STX, Lot 18-001, 99% purity, from Cifga, ES) solution of 1 ppm in10:90 H2O:MeOH (0.1% formic acid). Mass Spectrometer operated in electrospray positive polarity mode using Full scan (30–1500 m/z) and Collision-Induced Dissociation (CID) at 300 m/z and 316 m/z, corresponding to Saxitoxin and Neosaxitoxin molecules ion precursors. The spray voltage maintained at 7.0 kV; Capillary temperature at 350 °C; Capillary voltage and tube lens maintained at 22 and 50 kV, respectively. Nitrogen was used as sheath and auxiliary gas and collision energy at 35 eV. Separation was achieved on a ACE Excel C18 (50 × 2.1 mm I.D., 1.7 μm, Batch: v19-3430, AVANTOR ACE ®, VWR, PT) kept at 30 °C, with a flow rate of 0.25 mL min −1 . and injected volume was 10 μL in loop partial mode. The eluents used were methanol (A) and water (B) both acidified with formic acid at 0.1% (v/v). The gradient program started at 30% A, increasing to 60% A in 10 min, turning back to initial conditions in 5 min, equilibrating more 10 min with 30% A. Under these conditions, the SAX retention time (RT) was 3.75 min and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 3 μg L −1 and 5 μg L −1 , respectively. The precursor ion (m/z 300) and SAX reference fragment ions with m/z values of 282, 266, 240, 221, 204 and 144 were searched in the CID mode, to validate the presence or absence of the toxin. Statistical analysis All the analyses were performed with R software 93 . The Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test was performed with the kruskal.test function from the stats package, and the post-hoc Nemenyi test, with the function kwAllPairsNemenyiTest from the PMCMRplus package. Multi-variate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed with manova function from stats package, and multi-variate Shapiro–Wilks test with the function mvShapiro.Test , from package mvShapirotTest . Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated with cor function from stats package. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, employing Bray–Curtis distance, was performed with metaMDS function, from vegan package.PCA was performed with PCA function from FactoMineR package.

The update will return in 2024. If you're a fan of swimming in Cape Cod ponds, or your pet has been known to take a dip, it's a good idea to keep up-to-date with the latest cyanobacteria monitoring information. The Association to Preserve Cape Cod (APCC), along with volunteers, pond associations, towns and the state, is monitoring more than 100 freshwater ponds for concentrations of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and toxins produced by the bacteria. These toxins can affect the liver and nerves, and cause sickness in people and animals. When levels rise, association staff members alert towns. The towns then may post a prohibition on swimming and other activities in the pond until the algal population drops. What causes blue-green algae blooms? The blooms usually occur in the late summer, fueled by warm water or high levels of nutrients from fertilizers, runoff or wastewater seeping through the soil. But Cape ponds remain warm into the fall and algal blooms have occurred as late as December, according to officials. Here are the Cape Cod ponds under alert or watch for cyanobacteria: Falmouth/Mashpee Ashumet Pond on the border of Falmouth and Mashpee is under a public health advisory in both towns after a sample was taken on Nov. 6. The public is advised not to swim in the pond or drink the water. Keep pets away. If you come into contact with the water, rinse off immediately. Orleans Uncle Harvey's Pond in Orleans is a pond of concern after a sample was taken on Nov. 6. According to the APCC, the potential concern status means: ""At the time and place of sampling, results indicate either moderate risk for potential exposure to cyanobacterial toxins approaching but below state standards, or a likelihood for increasing cyanobacteria risk over the next days to weeks."" NOTE: If you notice pond water is scummy or discolored and may have a strong odor, the association advises the public to avoid contact with the water. If you see what might be a suspicious cyanobacteria bloom, notify your local health department and send a photo to cyano@apcc.org noting the location, date and time.

However, the discovery of hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase (HpnP) in Alphaproteobacteria led to the downfall of this molecular proxy. In the present study, we re-examined the distribution of HpnP in a new phylogenetic framework including recently proposed candidate phyla and re-interpreted a revised geological record of 2-methylhopanes based on contamination-free samples. We show that HpnP was probably present in the last common ancestor of cyanobacteria, while the gene appeared in Alphaproteobacteria only around 750 million years ago (Ma). A subsequent rise of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes around 600 Ma probably reflects the expansion of Alphaproteobacteria that coincided with the rise of eukaryotic algae—possibly connected by algal dependency on microbially produced vitamin B 12 . Our findings re-establish 2-methylhopanes as cyanobacterial biomarkers before 750 Ma and thus as a potential tool to measure the importance of oxygenic cyanobacteria as primary producers on early Earth. Our study illustrates how genetics can improve the diagnostic value of biomarkers and refine the reconstruction of early ecosystems.

Because cyanobacteria were presumably the only relevant group of oxygenic primary producers for much of the Precambrian 3 , their fossilized remnants can serve as an indicator for the presence of oxygenic photosynthesis and relative variations in primary production and carbon burial in the geological past. Yet taphonomic alteration and non-quantitative preservation of cyanobacterial microfossils render their use in Precambrian reconstructions complicated 4 . By contrast, lipid molecules from cyanobacterial cellular membranes are less susceptible to taphonomic bias in environments that favour the preservation of organic matter. Thus, fossilized lipids in the form of biomarker hydrocarbons—in this case hopanoids—can provide important semi-quantitative information for reconstructing the ecological importance of cyanobacteria in the deep past 5 , thereby framing the environmental context that is crucially needed for better understanding the evolution of increasingly complex life. Hopanoids are triterpenoid lipids predominantly produced by aerobic bacteria and considered functional analogues of eukaryotic sterols 6 , 7 . In contrast to the overall wide distribution of hopanoids in bacteria, hopanoids methylated at the C-2 position (2-methylhopanoids) have a much narrower taxonomical representation and were once extensively explored as taxon-specific biomarkers for cyanobacteria 8 . A cyanobacterial association was further supported by frequently observed concurrent records of elevated 2-methylhopane abundance and stable nitrogen isotope ratios suggestive of nitrogen fixation 9 , 10 —cyanobacteria being the major diazotrophs in modern oceans 11 . Although the physiological roles of methylhopanoids are not yet fully understood, protective roles against environmental stress have been suggested 12 , 13 . Precambrian rocks were found to generally contain higher proportions of 2-methylated hopanoids relative to Phanerozoic sediments, and this observation was interpreted to reflect an elevated proportion of cyanobacteria as Precambrian primary producers 8 , 14 . Also throughout the Phanerozoic, systematic trends and fluctuations in 2-methylhopane abundances relative to non-methylated regular hopanes (2-methylhopane index; 2-MHI) were widely used as an indicator of environmental stress and cyanobacterial proliferation 9 , 15 . Discovery of hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase (HpnP), however, called such interpretations into question by revealing the capacity for 2-methylhopanoid biosynthesis in both Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria 16 , 17 . It was even suggested that HpnP first evolved within aerobic Alphaproteobacteria 18 and was only later horizontally transferred to Cyanobacteria. These inferences ultimately led to much uncertainty, debate and a questionable utility of ecological proxies involving 2-methylhopanoids. Here we report on the existence of diagnostic time windows for fossil 2-methylhopanes in the geological past. Numerous new bacterial phyla have recently been found to possess hopanoid-producing genes 19 , and this urges a re-evaluation of 2-methylhopanoid distribution in bacteria and their geobiological implications. We re-examined the distribution of HpnP in the bacterial domain and its evolutionary history using up-to-date genomic datasets and an integrated approach towards phylogenetics 20 , 21 . In addition, by now, we know that pervasive contamination can overprint Precambrian lipid signatures, and doubts have been raised about previously published Precambrian biomarker records 22 . Hence, our molecular data were combined with new analyses of sedimentary 2-methylhopanes to provide an integrated account of 2-methylhopane production through Earth history. Results and discussion Hopanoid C-2 methyltransferase in bacteria HpnP is mostly distributed across a subset of bacteria that possess squalene cyclase (SC), which creates the non-methylated hopanoid structure. Nearly all species that possess both the SC and HpnP genes retain only a single copy of each gene. Synteny (gene co-localization) between the SC and HpnP genes was not observed in any phylum, and thus these two genes may be independently inherited. In the current study, SC was found in 31 bacterial phyla, whereas HpnP was found in 12 phyla (Fig. 1a ). This contrasts with only four phyla that were previously known to harbour HpnP-containing species 23 , 24 . Yet, the distribution of SC and HpnP is sporadic in most phyla that contain these two enzymes, and HpnP in particular is concentrated in three phyla: Rokubacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria (Fig. 1a,b ) (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Tables 1 − 5 provide more details). Rokubacteria is a recently proposed candidate phylum 25 , and its HpnP homologues have not been described thus far. Despite the sporadic occurrence of SC among bacteria, a recent comprehensive phylogenetic study suggests that SC was present in the individual common ancestors of three HpnP-containing phyla (Rokubacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria). This implies multiple events of SC gene loss within individual phyla, and HpnP seems to have followed a similar complex evolutionary history. It is currently not clear what selective pressure caused the loss or retention of the SC and HpnP genes. Fig. 1: Distribution of SC and HpnP in bacteria. a , Distribution in individual bacterial phyla; only phyla that harbour SC are shown. Light yellow colour indicates that only a small number of species possess the gene (below 10% of available genomes). Note that the orange colour does not necessarily mean the gene is ubiquitous in a phylum. Individual proteobacterial classes are treated as phyla in the main text.

The number of families within individual orders is shown in the second column, while the number of families that contain SC and HpnP is shown in the third and the fourth columns, respectively. Supplementary Tables 1 − 5 provide the details within individual families. Full size image HpnP phylogenetic analysis The evolutionary relationship of HpnP in 12 bacterial phyla was examined through phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 − 3 ). HpnP forms a monophyletic group among multiple clades of uncharacterized HpnP-like proteins (HpnP clade; Fig. 2 , insert). HpnP and HpnP-like proteins broadly retain three conserved domains: a B-12 binding domain, a radical SAM domain and a domain of unknown function (DUF4070). Vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) dependency of HpnP was recently experimentally confirmed 24 , and our results suggest this cobalamin dependency is a general characteristic of HpnP homologues. Other distant homologues with a radical SAM domain do not retain all three conserved domains. Currently, methyltransferase activity is confirmed only for several proteins in the HpnP clade, and thus it is unknown if HpnP-like proteins are even involved in hopanoid (or more generally terpenoid) biosynthesis. Individual clades of HpnP and HpnP-like proteins display different taxonomical distributions and the tree topology within those clades generally does not follow the species tree at the phylum level. Some species were found to possess multiple HpnP homologies, in addition to HpnP. For instance, many cyanobacteria possess two HpnP homologues—HpnP and an uncharacterized HpnP-like protein. The latter was once thought to be HpnP 26 , but this was later corrected 24 . Those HpnP-like proteins serve as outgroup sequences in the present study. Fig. 2: Maximum likelihood tree of HpnP protein sequences. The tree was generated using 135 representative sequences and 534 conserved sites. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% for both maximum likelihood inference and Bayesian inference (node support is shown only for major clades). Filled grey circles indicate that the node support is above the same threshold for one of the two inferences. The presence/absence of the SC gene is indicated next to the tree. The insert displays major clades of HpnP homologues (HpnP and HpnP-like proteins) that retain three conserved domains; B-12 binding domain, radical SAM domain and DUF4070 domain. The scale bar represents 0.4 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Supplementary Figs. 1 − 3 provide the complete trees with the species annotation. Full size image The deepest-branching HpnP homologues in the HpnP clade were obtained from Deltaproteobacteria (myxobacteria, in particular) that do not possess SC in their genomes (Fig. 2 ). This suggests that deltaproteobacterial HpnP homologues are not involved in hopanoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Note 2 ). We cannot exclude the possibility, however, that deltaproteobacteria containing HpnP homologues may acquire and methylate non-methylated hopanoid precursors from the environment. Except for Deltaproteobacteria, most bacteria that possess an early-diverging HpnP homologue also possess SC, and those bacteria presumably (although not experimentally confirmed) have the ability to produce 2-methylhopanoids. Currently, 2-methylhopanoid production has been confirmed only for the three late-branching phyla: Alphaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Acidobacteria 8 , 27 , 28 . Thus, characterization of early-diverging HpnP homologues from other bacterial phyla, including Deltaproteobacteria, may provide important information about the functional evolution of radical SAM methyltransferases towards HpnP. Focusing on HpnP proteins accompanied by SC, the tree topology does not replicate the known relationships between bacterial phyla and a complex history of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is inferred (Fig. 2 ). However, Cyanobacteria, Rokubacteria and Alphaproteobacteria are well separated with robust nodal support by both maximum likelihood and Bayesian inferences (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ), and no sign of recent HGT is observed. This suggests that the HGT events at the root of those sub-clades are ancient and the bacterial lineages that mediated those transfers (but were not necessarily producing 2-methylhopaonids themselves) are long extinct. Whereas HpnP sequences from Alphaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria dominate our dataset, the evolutionary pattern seen in the two clades is distinct. Alphaproteobacterial sequences come from a sporadic number of sub-clades, suggesting HpnP emerged late in the group, while cyanobacterial sequences largely mirror the species tree, suggesting HpnP was inherited vertically in crown-group cyanobacteria. These observed patterns are described in more detail below. Evolution of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria Unlike in previous studies that were based on more limited datasets 16 , 18 , alphaproteobacterial HpnP homologues do not form a monophyletic clade but instead cluster together with homologues from Acidobacteria and the newly proposed candidate phylum Eremiobacterota (Fig. 2 ). Hence, it is not clear if HpnP appeared only once in Alphaproteobacteria and was later horizontally transferred to the other phyla or if Alphaproteobacteria received HpnP through multiple HGT events from different sources. The two alphaproteobacterial clades are taxonomically distinct. One clade mostly consists of the family Methylobacteriaceae and some unclassified alphaproteobacteria, while the other principally contains Beijerinckiaceae and Nitrobacteraceae (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). These three alphaproteobacterial families belong to the same order Hyphomicrobiales (formerly Rhizobiales), while HpnP is nearly absent in other families (17 families in total; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). Further, the observed HpnP tree topology is not consistent with the currently inferred species tree of Hyphomicrobiales (Extended Data Fig. 1 ), and HpnP is nearly absent from other alphaproteobacterial orders (Fig. 1b ). Thus, we infer that HpnP was horizontally transferred to Alphaproteobacteria only after the divergence of Hyphomicrobiales, possibly multiple times independently. Evolution of HpnP in Cyanobacteria In contrast to Alphaproteobacteria, the HpnP branching order in Cyanobacteria broadly matches the species tree, despite the overall distribution of HpnP being sporadic at the species level (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 4 ). For instance, HpnP is found in two early-branching taxa ( Gloeobacter and Gloeomargarita ), and HpnP homologues from these taxa also branch early in the cyanobacterial HpnP tree. Here we examined the evolutionary history of cyanobacterial HpnP through reconciliation analyses of its tree topology. The reconciliation between the cyanobacterial HpnP tree and the species tree suggests that early-branching orders of the HpnP tree are well consistent with the species tree, while multiple transfer events of the HpnP gene seem to have occurred in individual sub-clades (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 4 and 5 ). The frequency of HGT is estimated to be no higher than ~15% (13 out of 86 branches) within HpnP-containing cyanobacterial species. Some putative transfer events are likely to be artefacts due to an inaccurate tree topology with low node supports and the heterotachy of some sub-clades in the HpnP tree (for example, weak node supports for the lineage that splits from Neosynechococcus ; Fig. 3 ). The absence of HpnP in the majority of cyanobacteria is attributed to gene loss that seems to have occurred multiple times independently in major lineages (Extended Data Fig. 2 and Supplementary Note 3 for detailed discussions). Our results suggest that HpnP was present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and was subsequently vertically inherited, with multiple gene loss events and potentially some transfers within the phylum. SC has similarly been inferred to have been present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria and vertically inherited 19 . However, this does not necessarily mean that SC and HpnP co-evolved, because no synteny is observed between the SC and HpnP genes. The ability to produce C-2 methylated hopanoids was thus probably present in the common ancestor of crown-group cyanobacteria, which contrasts with the here inferred late origin of alphaproteobacterial 2-methylhopanoid production (Supplementary Note 4 provides comparison with previous studies). Fig. 3: Maximum likelihood tree of HpnP in Cyanobacteria. A species tree that contained 44 representative cyanobacterial species (Supplementary Fig. 4 ) was compared to the HpnP tree through reconciliation analyses (Supplementary Fig. 5 for the comparison result and HGT inference by the reconciliation analysis software Notung). Solid lines in the HpnP tree indicate that they are consistent with the species tree. Dashed lines indicate that they are not consistent with the species tree, and thus the presence of HGT is inferred by Notung. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% for both maximum likelihood inference and Bayesian inference (node support is shown only for major clades). Filled grey circles indicate that the node support is above the same threshold for one of the two inferences. The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Full size image 2-Methylhopanoids as aerobiosis biomarkers The distribution of HpnP is nearly exclusive to obligate and facultative aerobes, even though the HpnP catalysis itself does not require molecular oxygen. HpnP-containing species constitute a subset of SC-containing bacteria, which are also mostly aerobes, although SC is additionally found in several anaerobic lineages (for example, Brocadiales, Desulfovibrionales) 29 , 30 . Hence, fossilized 2-methylhopanoids (2-methylhopanes) in the geological record are probable markers for aerobic bacteria and thus aerobic environments. This is consistent with an environmental survey that associated HpnP with microaerobic environments 17 . HpnP most likely evolved in, or was acquired by, stem-group cyanobacteria after the split from non-photosynthetic lineages (for example, Melainabacteria, Margulisbacteria; HpnP absent). In this framework, the analysis of geological 2-methylhopane records as aerobiosis markers potentially enables us to address the timing of incipient oxygen production before the onset of the GOE at ~2.4 billion years ago (Ga) as was originally proposed 8 , regardless of the phylogenetic identity of the biological host, if thermally well-preserved sedimentary sequences should ever be found 22 . Source of fossilized 2-methylhopanoids Understanding the evolutionary timeline of HpnP in individual phyla, in particular Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Rokubacteria, allows constraining the source of 2-methylhopanoids at different geological times. HpnP in additional bacteria suggests that Cyanobacteria was not the only lineage capable of producing 2-methylhopanoids. However, HpnP appears only sporadically in those additional lineages, possibly reflecting relatively recent HGT events or limited microbial sampling. Similarly, the presence of these proteins at the base of the HpnP tree could represent long branch attraction of proteins that are dissimilar from the better sampled clades (Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria)—perhaps representing a divergent function—or they could represent ancestry from an extinct lineage with an ancestral form of HpnP that was not necessarily involved in 2-methylhopanoid production, as implied for deltaproteobacterial HpnP homologues. We currently do not have enough data to adjudicate between these competing interpretations. Nevertheless, accepting these limitations, we can conclude that 2-methylhopanoid biosynthesis existed in Cyanobacteria before it appeared within Alphaproteobacteria. The evolutionary history of Rokubacteria is not constrained, and it remains unclear if any members actually produce geologically relevant amounts of 2-methylhopanoids. Rokubacteria are neither primary producers, nor have they been detected in marine settings. Also, rokubacterial HpnP seems confined to several late-branching clades, although the exact timing of HpnP acquisition is not clear (Extended Data Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 7 − 9 ). Hence, it appears unlikely that Rokubacteria substantially contributed to the Precambrian marine biomarker record. The same applies to other sporadic occurrences of HpnP discussed above. In contrast, cyanobacteria are generally accepted as important primary producers that substantially contributed to organic carbon burial throughout the mid-Proterozoic 3 , 31 . Also, our genome data reveal that HpnP is in fact distributed much more widely in marine cyanobacteria than previously known 23 (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Note 5 for more details). Therefore, cyanobacteria are the most likely source of fossilized 2-methylhopanoids before the evolution of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria (Hyphomicrobiales). Constraining the emergence of HpnP-containing Hyphomicrobiales then provides a means to determine geological periods and formations with (nearly) exclusively cyanobacterial signatures. The evolutionary timeline of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria was estimated using recently published phylogenomic analyses of Hyphomicrobiales (Fig. 4a ) 32 . This published dated phylogeny suggests that Hyphomicrobiales emerged around 1.5 Ga (node number 4 in Fig. 4a ), while the emergence of the stem groups of three major HpnP-containing families occurred only after 750 Ma (number 5 in Fig. 4a ; nodes a, b and c). The phylogenetic relationship between those families in the HpnP tree is not consistent with the species tree of Hyphomicrobiales, as described above (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). Thus, the HpnP gene was probably horizontally transferred to those three families after 750 Ma. In contrast, HpnP is widespread within the individual three families, suggesting the presence of HpnP in the common ancestors of each of those individual families. The divergence of those three families is estimated to have occurred after 500 Ma (Fig. 4a ; three triangles in red) 32 . Therefore, the emergence of HpnP in Alphaproteobacteria can be estimated to having occurred between the emergence of the stem groups and the divergence of the crown groups of three HpnP-containing families, somewhere between 750 and 500 Ma (node number 5; Fig. 4a ). In turn, fossilized 2-methylhopanoids in marine sedimentary rocks deposited before 750 Ma probably indicate cyanobacterial sources.

Both the tree topology and the node dates were adapted from a recent phylogenomic study (Supplementary Fig. 10 ) 32 . Numbers in the tree indicate major evolutionary events for the two phyla Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria: (1) divergence of crown-group cyanobacteria; (2) divergence of Alphaproteobacteria from Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria; (3) divergence of crown-group Alphaproteobacteria; (4) divergence of Hyphomicrobiales; (5) divergence of HpnP-containing Hyphomicrobiales families—Beijerinckiaceae (node a), Methylobacteriaceae (node b) and Nitrobacteraceae (node c). Nodes a, b and c indicate the emergence of three HpnP-containing families in Hyphomicrobiales. Node bars denote the 95% highest posterior density interval of posterior dates.

Each circle and square represent the average of all 2-MHI values from individual geological formations or published studies (Supplementary Table 7 ).

Full size image Non-contaminated 2-methylhopane record in the Precambrian The record of the 2-methylhopane index (2-MHI) published thus far is generally characterized by high values in Precambrian rocks and oils (up to 19%), relative to those in younger organic matter, and an elevated proportion of cyanobacterial primary production was thus inferred for the early Earth 8 , 14 . However, the syngeneity (analytes having the same age as the host rock) of 2-methylhopanes in Precambrian samples has never been adequately and systematically assessed. By now, it is widely recognized that even traces of contamination can pose a serious problem for organic-lean Precambrian samples, as was previously scrutinized for Archaean biomarker studies 22 . Hence, we re-investigated Precambrian rocks using rigorous slice-extraction and interior–exterior experiments, allowing us to separately study non-contaminated sample interiors and contamination-prone sample exteriors (surfaces) 22 , 33 . Our analyses revealed that high 2-MHI values are restricted to sample exteriors—up to 17% in the 1.64 Ga Barney Creek Formation that hosts the oldest known 2-MHI record 33 (Supplementary Note 6 and Supplementary Table 6 )—whereas non-contaminated interiors exhibit 2-MHI values with an average of 1.1% ( n = 42) and a maximum of only 2.4% (Extended Data Fig. 4 ). Abiotic hopanoid methylation at the position C-2 is highly unlikely (Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 12 ). As our results highlight the need for a systematic re-evaluation of Precambrian 2-methylhopane abundances, we compiled a new non-contaminated 2-MHI record based on newly analysed rock samples from the Phanerozoic to the Paleoproterozoic that underwent syngeneity assessment ( n = 161), combined with previously published 2-MHI values, excluding any potentially contaminated samples from the pre-Ediacaran period ( n = 507) (Supplementary Table 7 ). In contrast to previous findings, the revised 2-MHI record exhibits consistently low relative 2-methylhopane abundances until the end of the Snowball Earth glaciations around 635 Ma (2-MHI < 2.4%; n = 93; average = 0.96%) (Fig. 4b ). An initial increase to 5.4% is observed in the early Ediacaran ( ~ 620 Ma) and followed by multiple episodes of large fluctuations. While the 2-MHI in the Ediacaran and Phanerozoic can be extremely high for individual formations (up to 24%), the averaged values over geological time units remain moderate at ~5%. Ecological implications of 2-methylhopanes Comparatively low 2-MHI values (~1%) in the mid-Proterozoic represent the average contribution of cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoids to mid-Proterozoic sediments and provide a baseline for gauging the activity of cyanobacteria, even though the 2-methylhopanoid production by marine cyanobacteria seems to be confined to nearshore environments 34 , 35 (Supplementary Table 5 and Supplementary Note 8 for detailed discussions). The ‘rise of algae’ in the Cryogenian that broke the billion-year incumbency of cyanobacteria was attributed to a changing nutrient regime, which was triggered by massive glaciogenic inputs of phosphorus into oceans and allowed eukaryotic algae to permanently outcompete cyanobacteria 3 . Ecological shifts throughout the Ediacaran period—diminished abundances of microbial mats 36 , 37 and the expansion of HpnP-free cyanobacteria as major primary producers in pelagic regions (Extended Data Fig. 2 )—should have curtailed net cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoid productions and preservations. This draws particular attention to the unexpected Ediacaran increase of the 2-MHI that probably reflects the emergence of non-cyanobacterial 2-methylhopanoid sources that may have played an important ecological role in Ediacaran oceans (Fig. 4b ). Combining the biomarker record with time-calibrated genetic analyses points to the emergence of this lipid biosynthetic capacity in Alphaproteobacteria as an explanation (500–750 Ma; Fig. 4a ). This inference is consistent with recent studies that proposed Alphaproteobacteria as the major source of Phanerozoic 2-methylhopanes 23 , 24 and also the dominance of alphaproterobacterial HpnP genes in many modern marine metagenomes 17 (Supplementary Notes 4 and 5 ). Hence, it is likely that the Ediacaran increase of the 2-MHI reflects the expansion of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria. We hypothesize that this dynamic shift in 2-methylhopanoid producers and the rise of algae proceeded in concert. It is well known that eukaryotes depend on symbiotic microbes for nutrient acquisition and have co-evolved with those symbionts, as observed for algae, plants and animals 38 , 39 . For instance, eukaryotes cannot biosynthesize vitamin B 12 (cobalamin) de novo, although the majority of green algae require this nutrient for the biosynthesis of the essential amino acid methionine (Supplementary Note 9 ) 40 . Dissolved oceanic vitamin B 12 concentrations are generally too low to sustain the growth of algae, which thus rely on the uptake of microbially produced vitamin B 12 (ref. 40 ). Vitamin B 12 dependency evolved in several algal lineages independently during the course of evolution, through developing mutualistic relationships with microbial donors and retaining an efficient vitamin B 12 -dependent methionine synthase 40 . In modern environments, dominant vitamin B 12 contributors to algae are Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria 41 , 42 that utilize an oxygen-dependent pathway for vitamin B 12 biosynthesis 41 , whose presence is predicted for many HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria (Supplementary Table 3 ). Hence, an expansion of vitamin B 12 -producing Alphaproteobacteria in mutualistic relationship with algae during the Ediacaran may be one factor tying the steep rise of 2-MHI values to the rise of algae (Supplementary Note 9 for more details). The elevated 2-MHI may additionally reflect an increased reworking of newly available algal biomass in increasingly oxygenated marine environments by heterotrophic Alphaproteobacteria. These hypotheses are complementary to the previously proposed relationship between 2-methylhopanoid production and the nitrogen cycle during Cretaceous oceanic anoxic events (Supplementary Note 4 ) 23 , 24 . In view of enhanced alphaproteobacterial 2-methylhopanoid production going back to the Ediacaran, it is likely that HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria were responsible for modulating the 2-MHI throughout the Phanerozoic. Conclusions The once suggested association of 2-methylhopanoids with cyanobacteria—a highly important proxy tool for our understanding of Earth system evolution and oxygen dynamics in the geological past—has been constantly debated. Both Cyanobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria can biosynthesize 2-methylhopanoids, and thus sedimentary 2-methylhopanes are not a diagnostic biomarker for a single taxonomic group. We show that such ambiguities can be refined by adding a genetic perspective. The phylogenetic tree topology of HpnP in Cyanobacteria suggests that HpnP was probably present in the common ancestor of crown-group cyanobacteria, whereas according to molecular clock analyses alphaproteobacterial lineages acquired HpnP after 750 Ma. This finding re-establishes the utility of 2-methylhopanes as a biomarker for cyanobacteria in pre-Ediacaran rocks, enabling us to measure the importance of HpnP-containing oxygenic cyanobacteria in the geological past. By contrast, 2-methylhopanes in post-Cryogenian oceans reflect additional signals from heterotrophic 2-methylhopanoid producers—Alphaproteobacteria. The synchronization between the 2-MHI increase during the Ediacaran and the ecological expansion of HpnP-containing Alphaproteobacteria and eukaryotic algae may not be coincidental, involving a vitamin B 12 -based mutualistic relationship between Alphaproteobacteria and algae and enhanced reworking of algal biomass by Alphaproteobacteria in increasingly oxygenated marine environments. Our study demonstrates the strength of combining the geological record of fossil hydrocarbon biomarkers with genetic analyses to gain insights into ancient ecosystems and provides an important precedent for refining our understanding of biomarker utility throughout Earth’s history. Methods Bioinformatics analyses HpnP dataset construction Representative sequences for hopanoid biosynthesis enzymes were identified from UniProt ( https://www.uniprot.org/ ); HpnP ( B3QHD1 ), SC ( P33247 ). These protein sequences were utilized as seeds to identify homologous sequences in all three domains of life. Sequences were retrieved from GenBank ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ), using BLASTp and PSI-Blast 43 , 44 , with the cut-off threshold of <1 × 10 −5 . Taxonomically redundant sequences were excluded. Protein domain identification was performed using HMMER v3.3.1 (ref. 45 ) with the PFAM-A database ( http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/Pfam/current_release/Pfam-A.hmm.gz ). Phylogenetic analysis Sequences were aligned using Muscle v3.8.31 (ref. 46 ). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by maximum likelihood inference using IQ-TREE v2.1.06 (ref. 47 ) and by Bayesian inference using MrBayes v3.2.6 (ref. 48 ). Substitution models were selected using ModelFinder in IQ-TREE−LG matrix with empirical frequencies estimated from the data ( F ) and the FreeRate model for rate heterogeneity across sites ( R ). For maximum likelihood inference, branch support was obtained by Ultrafast bootstrap in IQ-TREE. For Bayesian inference, two Markov chain Monte Carlo chains were run for at least 1,000,000 generations until the maximum discrepancy between chains was <0.05. A consensus tree was generated from two chains using a burn-in of 10% of sampled points. In initial analyses, several protein sequences were found to display high sensitivity to sequence alignments and instable positioning in generated trees (accession numbers PYX91820 and HBG07613 ). These sequences were excluded from the subsequent analyses. Cyanobacterial species tree construction and gene tree/species tree reconciliation The list of cyanobacterial species with HpnP proteins was used to create a species tree. The species names were converted into taxon IDs using the NCBI Taxonomy name/id Status Report Page ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/TaxIdentifier/tax_identifier.cgi ). These IDs were used with the research command line utility 49 to download all proteins for each taxon in NCBI’s Identical Protein Group (IGP) database. Single-copy orthologous proteins were identified in these IGP datasets using OrthoFinder v2.5.4 (ref. 50 ). OrthoFinder identified 34 single-copy orthologue groups, which were individually aligned using MUSCLE 46 and then concatenated together into a supermatrix using FASconCAT-G 51 . The species tree was generated from this supermatrix using IQ-TREE, including details of each protein’s beginning and end in the supermatrix alignment. We allowed IQ-TREE to determine the best model of amino acid evolution for each protein in the supermatrix individually before performing maximum likelihood inference. Once the species tree was generated, we compared how the topology of the cyanobacterial HpnP gene tree matched with the species tree using NOTUNG v2.9 tree reconciliation (DTL model) 52 . Rokubacteria species tree construction and gene tree/species tree reconciliation The phylum currently contains only metagenomic samples, and thus the same species tree construction as performed for cyanobacteria was not possible. Instead, a species tree was constructed by concatenating three ribosomal proteins L2, L3 and L4 (Supplementary Table 1 ), using IQ-TREE. The best substitution model was also determined by IQ-TREE. The topology of the rokubacterial HpnP tree was compared with the generated species tree using NOTUNG v2.9 (DTL model). Biomarker analyses Selection of previous biomarker studies Previous studies that are included in our dataset are summarized in Supplementary Table 7 (black colour). Phanerozoic samples are generally organic rich, and thus the influence of trace contamination overprint is probably negligible in most cases. Moreover, a much higher density of available datapoints minimizes the risk of interpreting outliers and unrepresentative samples. Therefore, samples were selected to uniformly cover the whole Phanerozoic period without considering the syngeneity of observed biomarkers. In contrast, Precambrian samples are mostly organic lean and thus are easily overprinted by trace contamination as shown for samples from the 1.64 Ga McArthur Basin (Supplementary Note 6 ). To minimize uncertainty due to contamination, Precambrian samples in our dataset consist mostly of our newly analysed samples, except for Ediacaran oil samples that are highly organic rich and difficult to substantially adulterate through contamination overprint. Biomarker extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy measurement Samples that were newly analysed in this study are summarized in Supplementary Table 7 (highlighted in red). Biomarkers were extracted using interior–exterior and slice-extraction experiments as previously described 22 , 53 . For the interior–exterior experiments, rock samples were cut into two portions using a diamond saw—the exterior (exposed surface; approximately 3 mm thickness) and the interior (inner core). Slice-extraction experiments are an extension of the interior–exterior experiments, and rocks were cut into more than two slices to analyse the millimetre-scale distribution of biomarkers. Each slice was crushed independently with a stainless-steel puck mill and bitumen extracted with a Dionex Accelerated Solvent Extractor (ASE 200) using dichloromethane (DCM) for GR7 samples 33 and 90:10% DCM:methanol for LV09001 samples. Saturated fractions were eluted with 1.5 dead volumes n -hexane on a microcolumn of annealed (300 °C, 12 h) and dry-packed silica gel. D4-C 29 αααR-ethylcholestane (D4; Chiron Laboratories AS) was added to the saturate fraction before gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) analyses with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 60 m DB-5 MS capillary column (0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 µm film thickness; Agilent Technologies) coupled to a Micromass Autospec Premier double sector mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation). Hopanes were analysed with M + (412 for C 30 hopanes)→ m / z 191 and methylhopanes with M + → m / z 205 multiple reaction monitoring transitions. 2-Methylhopane peak assignment was based on the retention time and the comparison with the Australian Geological Survey Organisation standard. Using a DB-5 MS capillary column, C 31 2-methylhopane elutes just before C 30 αβ hopane on the chromatogram. Pyrolysis Aliquots (1 mg) of diplopterol (courtesy of P. Adam and P. Schaeffer, University of Strasbourg), 5α(H)-cholestanol (≥95%, Sigma-Aldrich) or cholesterol (≥99%, Sigma-Aldrich) were transferred to glass tubes flame sealed at one end (Duran, 8 mm diameter, 1 mm wall thickness) dissolved in DCM. After DCM evaporation, ~20 mg active carbon (Sigma-Aldrich, DARCO, 100 mesh particle size, CAS: 7440-44-0) was added, tubes were evacuated to ≤300 mTorr and flame sealed with a gas torch. After pyrolysis in an oven at 300 °C for 24 h, tubes were cooled to room temperature, cracked open and the active carbon was transferred with sequential solvent rinses of n -hexane, DCM and methanol onto a small silica plug in a 4 ml solid phase extraction glass tube and subsequently extracted with about 10 ml n -hexane, 10 ml DCM and at least 4 ml methanol. Once solvents were evaporated under a stream of N 2 , the pyrolysate was applied onto a silica gel microcolumn (about 500 mg in a glasswool-plugged Pasteur pipette), and the saturated hydrocarbon fraction was eluted with 1.5 dead volumes n -hexane followed by GC–MS analysis. Pyrolysates were analysed on a Thermo Quantum XLS Ultra triple-quadrupole MS coupled to a Thermo Trace GC Ultra fitted with a VF-1 MS column (40 m, 0.15 mm i.d., 0.15 μm film thickness).

Extended data Extended Data Fig. 1 Evolutionary relationship of alphaproteobacterial HpnP proteins. Three major HpnP-containing families are shown in the two alphaproteobacterial sub-clades within the HpnP tree (Methylobacteriaceae, Nitrobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae). The inset indicates the species relationship between the three Hyphomicrobiales families 32 . See Supplementary Fig. 1 for the complete tree with the species annotation. Extended Data Fig. 2 Evolution of the extant lineages of marine planktonic cyanobacteria and its relationship to HpnP gene loss. HpnP was likely lost long before the emergence of extant planktonic marine species. The dated species tree is adapted from a recent molecular clock study (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for the original figure with the species annotation) 54 . Presence/absence of HpnP in individual sub-clades was inferred from Supplementary Table 5 and recently-published phylogenomic studies of Cyanobacteria 55 , 56 . Inference for the vertical inheritance of the HpnP gene (solid line) is based on Fig. 3 . Several representative HpnP-containing species are shown next to the corresponding clades. Asterisks indicate that the species is closely related to the corresponding clade, but is not included in the dataset in the cited study. Light blue circles indicate the possible timing of HpnP gene loss in the lineages that include modern marine planktonic species. It is noted that the timing of HpnP gene loss is possibly even earlier, depending on the actual HpnP evolutionary history in Cyanobacteria (dashed lines; vertical inheritance vs. horizontal transfer). Figure adapted from ref. 54 under a Creative Commons license CC BY 4.0 . Extended Data Fig. 3 Distribution of HpnP in Rokubacteria. A species tree that contained 56 representative rokubacterial species (Supplementary Fig. 7 ) was compared to the HpnP tree (Supplementary Fig. 8 ) through Notung reconciliation analyses (Supplementary Fig. 9 ). Solid lines in the HpnP tree indicate that they are consistent with the species tree. Dashed lines indicate that they are not consistent with the species tree and thus the presence of HGT is inferred by Notung. Filled black circles indicate that the node support is >85% (node support is shown only for major clades). The scale bar represents 0.1 amino acid replacements per site per unit evolutionary time. Extended Data Fig. 4 Stratigraphic trend of the 2-MHI. 2-MHI values were calculated for the Paleoproterozoic LV09001 drill core from the McArthur Basin in Northern Australia ( ~ 1.64 Ga) (see also Supplementary Note 6 ). Representative chromatograms for non-methylated hopanes (C 30 diahopanes, C 30 & C 31 hopanes) and methylhopanes (2α and 3β) are shown (478.2 m depth). C 31 2-methylhopane elutes just prior to C 30 αβ-hopane on a DB-5 MS capillary column. Chromatograms are annotated by Metastable Reaction Monitoring (MRM) precursor → products pairs. Percentages provide relative heights of the largest peaks in the chromatograms.

Ray Ewing News Government Nature & Science Cyanobacteria Reaches Red-Grade Status in Four Ponds Thomas Humphrey Thursday, July 27, 2023 - 4:05pm Print 7 Comments Clean, safe water in public ponds is no longer a given on Martha’s Vineyard. So far this summer, Islanders have been warned against going in or even coming in contact with parts of four different ponds because of harmful blooms of biotoxin-producing microbes. MVCyano, a coalition of local boards of health and the Great Pond Foundation, has issued “red-grade” cyanobacteria bloom advisories in Chilmark Pond, Tisbury Great Pond, James Pond and a pond at Mink Meadows. The group recommends against any and all contact with the potentially toxic water for humans and pets alike. Emily Reddington, the executive director of the Great Pond Foundation, holds a cyanobacteria advisory sign used to warn the public. 
          
        — Ray Ewing Several other ponds, including Squibnocket and Edgartown Great Pond, have had lower-level warnings. The proliferation of cyanobacteria blooms is a relatively recent trend on Martha’s Vineyard, an Island peppered with brackish ponds once thought to be inhospitable to the microorganisms that constitute these toxic blooms. Now, as waters warm and as nitrogen pollution disrupts coastal ecosystems, scientists and health officials are working to understand the causes and impacts of cyanobacteria blooms on-Island. “It’s right at the cutting edge of science,” said David Bouck, who recently took over as director of science and collaboration with the Great Pond Foundation. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, is a group of single-celled, photosynthetic organisms widespread in ponds, oceans and estuaries across the globe. When present in high concentrations, known as blooms, some cyanobacteria species can produce “cyanotoxins” toxic to humans and dogs. Knowledge about how cyanobacteria behave in conditions present on the Vineyard, however, is limited. During an interview at the foundation’s laboratory, Mr. Bouck brandished the 1,000-plus-page World Health Organization guide to cyanobacteria. “The body of knowledge is constantly changing, there’s a lot we just don’t know yet,” he said. “They update this every year . . . but it mostly deals with freshwater ecosystems.” The collaboration that became MVCyano had its roots in 2020. Several consecutive years of visible blooms and tests indicating high levels of cyanotoxins in the ponds impelled the boards of health and the foundation to map out a game plan for how to deal with the phenomenon. “We didn’t have a way to test if there was a bloom, or to communicate if there was a bloom or take samples from the right place if there was a bloom,” said Emily Reddington, executive director of the Great Pond Foundation. “When we didn’t know what to do, we did a lot of research to find out who did.” The blueprint for the Vineyard, it turns out, is from another island in the northeast. Researchers on Long Island in New York who studied the brackish estuaries in the Hamptons had seen the blooms for years. David Bouck with the Great Pond Foundation said the Island is still learning about cyanobacteria. 
          
        — Ray Ewing “They are warmer, and they have greater development pressures, so it’s like the Vineyard into the future if nothing is changed,” Ms. Reddington said. The foundation teamed up with the Gobler Laboratory at Stony Brook University to take advantage of that expertise. While Mr. Bouck can identify the presence of a bloom with his lab equipment, researchers at Stony Brook are able to identify individual species — no easy feat when it comes to cyanobacteria. “Cyanobacteria are always there, and they always have been,” Mr. Bouck said, noting that the microorganisms were among the first photosynthetic life forms to evolve on earth, giving them millennia to diversify. The mere presence of cyanobacteria, Mr. Bouck said, is not the problem – only when environmental factors cause the microbe to unnaturally proliferate does it begin to pose a threat to other organisms. “A cyanobacteria bloom is a sign of an ecosystem out of balance,” he said. That imbalance is typically caused by nitrogen pollution in the ponds, he said, which he said has its origins in home septic systems. That assertion was confirmed by a study completed by the foundation last year, which identified septic systems as the primary source of nitrogen pollution in Island ponds. Increased nitrogen gives cyanobacteria an extra boost to grow in brackish Vineyard estuaries, which, Ms. Reddington said, can have knock-on effects for human toxicity. “We’re dealing with cyanobacteria that they didn’t think could be in marine situations . . . that are the extremes of their tolerance,” she said. “If you stress out a cyanobacteria . . . it gets pretty upset, and under that stress condition it might produce higher than expected levels of cyanotoxin.” The group’s current effort is focused on unraveling the complex interactions contributing to and resulting from blooms, with the foundation testing water samples collected by the boards of health and from stations monitored by their staff. The group also started a study into the genetic material in those samples, hoping to understand how cyanobacteria interact with other microbes in Island waters. Increased awareness of blooms has also helped the foundation improve their coverage. Squibnocket Pond has a lower-level warning. 
          
        — Ray Ewing “We also sometimes get reports from the public that say, ‘I see something green, can you come take a sample?’” Ms. Reddington said. The identifications of blooms in the Tisbury Great Pond and at Mink Meadows this year were both the result of public reporting. But to fix the issue at its source will require a major shift in current Island trends and attitudes, according to Mr. Bouck. “Nutrient issues are kind of becoming more of an issue. Temperatures are increasing and pace of development has increased,” he said. “We need to change the way that we interact with the ecosystem to bring it back into balance.” Thomas Humphrey More by Thomas Humphrey Cyanobacteria Tisbury Great Pond Water quality Comments (7) Michael Stone , North Tisbury unfortunately here we go again. over development large homes causing environmental damages to a precious ecosystem.

July 28, 2023 - 5:21pm reply Anna Edey , Vineyard Haven Yes, we need to do what DEP was planning to require:  75% reduction of nitrogen pollution within 5 years, by applying I/A tech on all Title 5 systems located within the various watershed areas that drain to our various ponds.
But the current projected costs for DEP-approved I/A tech are terrifying: $37-49,000. 
However, there are equally effective I/A systems that cost 50-75% less than those that have been approved by DEP. Now's the time to give local permits for such systems, under strict protocol of inspectings and testing, performed by a trained all-island team, administered under our boards of health.

The plant-biomass-sugar route dominates the current glucose supply, while the direct conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose through photosynthesis is not well studied. Here, we show that the potential of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 for photosynthetic glucose production can be unlocked by preventing native glucokinase activity. Knocking out two glucokinase genes causes intracellular accumulation of glucose and promotes the formation of a spontaneous mutation in the genome, which eventually leads to glucose secretion. Without heterologous catalysis or transportation genes, glucokinase deficiency and spontaneous genomic mutation lead to a glucose secretion of 1.5 g/L, which is further increased to 5 g/L through metabolic and cultivation engineering. These findings underline the cyanobacterial metabolism plasticities and demonstrate their applications for supporting the direct photosynthetic production of glucose.

The breakdown of glucose provides energy and carbon materials in cells throughout all domains of life, powering the cellular machinery by diverse glycolytic pathways, including the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway, the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, and the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway 1 , 2 . As monomers, glucose, and its derivatives are also involved in the synthesis of various macromolecules and cellular components 3 , 4 . Moreover, glucose also serves as an important feedstock in the biorefinery industry, supporting the cultivation of multiple microbial cell factories for green biomanufacturing of fuels, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals 5 , 6 , 7 . In nature, glucose is mainly synthesized through the photosynthesis of plants and algae and exists as monomers of polysaccharides in plant/algae biomass, e.g., cellulose and starch. The plant-biomass-sugar route dominates the current massive glucose supply, whose economic feasibility is influenced by multiple parameters, such as plant-cultivation cycles, biomass-collection radius, and pre-treatment costs 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 . Against the backdrop of the global climate crisis and worsening food shortages, developing more efficient, continual, and industrial glucose production routes would be valuable 12 , 13 . In recent years, direct conversion of carbon dioxide into glucose, glucose precursors, and glucose polymers has been achieved by chemical-biochemical, electrochemical-biological, and in vitro cascade enzymatic routes 14 , 15 , 16 . In contrast, continuous glucose production has not been successfully linked directly to photosynthesis. In photoautotrophs, e.g., higher plants and algae, glucose is synthesized as storage for carbon and energy and plays important regulatory roles. Glucose metabolism possesses complex interactions with photosystems, disturbs the synthesis and metabolism of pigments, and might even inhibit the photosynthetic activities 17 , 18 , 19 ; thus, free glucose is rarely synthesized or accumulated in excess in photosynthetic cellular metabolism. In cyanobacteria, a group of oxygenic prokaryotic microalgae, some progress has been made to facilitate the direct synthesis and secretion of natural or non-natural sugars through genetic manipulations 20 , 21 , 22 . However, the photosynthetic production of glucose has not yet been well-studied. The recombinant strains can only produce limited amounts of glucose accompanied by the production of other sugars, suggesting that more detailed mechanisms of glucose metabolism in photoautotrophs remain to be disclosed 23 , 24 . In this work, we aim to engineer a direct and stable conversion of carbon dioxide to glucose through cyanobacteria photosynthesis. In a model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (hereafter PCC 7942 for short), we identify the native glucokinase activity as the bottleneck restricting the metabolism potential for glucose synthesis. Targeted knockout of two glucokinase genes disturbs the carbohydrate metabolism and activates a metabolic flux towards glucose through the sucrose metabolism network, which is generally considered as a specialized response to osmotic stress. The enhanced glucose synthesis promotes the enrichment of a specific spontaneous genomic mutation on the chromosome of PCC 7942, which facilitates efficient glucose secretion. By implementing multiple omics approaches combined with systematic genetic manipulations, we clarify the pathways and mutations leading to glucose synthesis and secretion and optimize the glucose synthesis performances of the recombinant strains. Through subsequent metabolic engineering and cultivation optimization, the glucose secreted by the engineered strain surpasses 5 g/L during long-term cultivation, accounting for up to 70% of the fixed carbon source. Results Blocking glucose consumption by knocking out the glucokinases There are usually three steps to achieve efficient microbial production of the target metabolites: to construct pathways for the synthesis of the products 25 , 26 , to eliminate reactions that consume such products 27 , 28 , and to facilitate the mechanisms for product secretion 20 , 23 . Previous studies have shown that PCC 7942 can uptake extracellular glucose for biomass production by using heterologous glucose transporters, demonstrating their natural capacities for intracellular glucose consumption 29 . Two glucokinase genes ( Synpcc7942_0221 , glk1 ; Synpcc7942_2111 , glk2 ) that phosphorylate glucose to initiate the EMP or OPP pathway have been annotated on the PCC 7942 genome, so they were selected as knockout targets to block intracellular glucose re-assimilation. The manipulations were performed in parallel using a wild-type PCC 7942 (WT) and a recombinant strain carrying an E. coli sourced glucose transporter GalP (SZ14, Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2 ). Previously, GalP has proven to be effective for facilitating glucose absorption in PCC 7942 29 , 30 , and here we use it to evaluate the impacts of glucokinase deficiency on the glucose consumption capacities of PCC 7942. Due to the polyploidy characteristics of cyanobacteria, passages with antibiotics-selection were necessary to isolate the desired homozygotes. Recombinant strains carrying an inactivated glucokinase gene ( glk1 or glk2 ) were easily obtained, but homozygote with simultaneously inactivated glk1 and glk2 in WT was difficult to isolate. Among several independent attempts, only one process resulted in a homozygote strain (SZ3) with a tailored genotype (completely blocked glk1 and glk2 ) after six weeks of continuous passages, while all the others failed (meaning that the wild-type copy of glk1 or glk2 could not be removed). The results indicated that glucokinase might have essential physiological functions, and potential secondary genomic mutations might be necessary for cellular acclimation to the deficiency. In the SZ14 strain carrying the GalP transporter, the homozygote mutant (SZ17) with simultaneously blocked glk1 and glk2 was more easily isolated, which indicates that the GalP activity might buffer the disturbance caused by the glucokinase deficiency. Enzymatic assays revealed that both genes ( glk1 and glk2 ) contributed to the glucokinase activity in PCC 7942, and their simultaneous knockout reduced glucokinase activity by about 70% in SZ3; as for the SZ14 strain with GalP transporter, glucokinase activity was even more significantly reduced by knocking out the two genes (in SZ17) to a lower level than that of SZ3 (Fig. 1a ). The residual glucokinase activities could be attributed to other non-specific kinases (e.g., fructokinase and phosphofructokinase). The higher glucokinase activity residual in SZ3 than that in SZ17 indicated that the wild-type background seemed essential to maintain a certain degree of glucokinase activity, so the recombinant strain underwent long-term domestication to adapt to the loss of the activities by uncertain mechanisms.

Data are presented as mean values ± SD ( n = 3 biological replicates). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image The mixotrophic cultivation results confirmed that intracellular glucose consumption was prevented in PCC 7942 as per the design. Supplementation of glucose (30 mM) improved the biomass production of the SZ14 strain (carrying the GalP transporter) by three folds, whereas no growth improvement was detected in the glucokinase-deficient strain, which indicated a loss in glucose utilization capacity (Fig. 1b ). In addition, the supplementation of glucose led to the recovery of glucokinase activity in the deficient strains (Fig. 1c ), indicating an adaptive response of the PCC 7942 metabolism toward exogenous glucose including stimulation of non-specific glucokinase activities. Glucokinase deficiency resulted in glucose secretion The enzymatic assay results indicated that glucokinase activities might be essential for PCC 7942 cells to maintain metabolism homeostasis, while the dependence could be partially relieved by introducing the glucose transporter GalP. Given the effects of GalP on native glucokinase dependence, we hypothesized that the glucokinase deficiency in PCC 7942 would lead to an abnormal accumulation of specific metabolites, that could be exported by GalP to relieve the potential toxicity or feedback stress. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the secreted metabolite profiles of the glucokinase-deficient strains (Supplementary Fig. 3a ) and found that significant amounts of glucose were accumulated in the culture medium. Under the adopted cultivation conditions (BG11 medium, 100 μmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply), 1.0 g/L and 0.33 g/L glucose were synthesized by SZ3 (WT- ∆glk1-∆glk2 ) and SZ17 (WT -∆glk1-∆glk2-∆NS3 :: galP ) strain respectively (Fig. 2 ). In addition, the accumulation of glucose occurred in the same pace as the cellular biomass production, which indicates that the extracellular glucose was synthesized and secreted by the living cells rather than from the contents of lysed cells. When carbon supply and illumination were further enhanced (3% CO 2 v/v in air, 200 μmol photons/m 2 /s), the glucose production of SZ3 and SZ17 increased to 1.64 g/L and 1.16 g/L, respectively; and the rates of the two strains for biomass accumulations were also improved. During the process, intracellular glucose concentrations in the glucokinase deficiency strains also increased (Supplementary Fig. 3b ). As for SZ3, about 5.6 mg/L/OD 730 glucose (over 70-fold higher than that of the control) was accumulated inside the cells on Day 6, and for SZ17, the intracellular glucose concentration reached up to 2.8 mg/L/OD 730 . Fig. 2: Cell growth and glucose secretions of the glucokinase-deficient strains. Cell densities ( a ) and extracellular glucose concentratons ( b ) of the the glucokinasedeficient strains SZ3 and SZ17 were measured and compared.

Full size image To exclude the potential contributions of organic carbon source in the BG11 medium to glucose synthesis, we removed the citrate and ferric amine citrate components from the medium, but found no negative effect on glucose production, although cell growth of the recombinant strains was slightly diminished (Supplementary Fig. 4a–c ). We also performed isotope labeling cultivation to evaluate the contributions from organic carbon sources. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 4d–i , when the recombinant Synechococcus cells were cultivated with 13 C labeled NaHCO 3 , the synthesized glucose could be rapidly labeled by 13 C, and the addition or removal of citrate and ferric amine citrate caused minor impacts on the labeling rates. Thus, we could propose that the glucose secreted by recombinant strains was dominantly from the conversion of inorganic carbon dioxide. Compared with previous reports, photosynthetic production of glucose by cyanobacteria was improved in this work. Over tenfold higher glucose productivity (0.27 g/L/OD 730 versus 0.027 g/L/OD 730 ) was achieved without the introduction or overexpression of any catalytic enzymes in Synechococcus . Moreover, the glucose synthesis of recombinant PCC 7942 continued during the rapid growth phase independent of any environmental stress inductions (e.g., salts stress or dark treatment) 23 , 24 . In addition, the SZ3 strain secreted most of the glucose (>95%, approximately 0.27 g/L/OD 730 versus 5.6 mg/L/OD 730 ) independently of heterologous transporters, suggesting that unknown glucose transportation mechanisms were activated by the glucokinase deficiency. Glucose synthesis is dominated by the sucrose metabolism pathway Glucose is generally not recognized as a main intracellular metabolite in PCC 7942, so we did not expect that blocking the glucose consumption capacity would shift a large portion of the carbon flux toward glucose synthesis. Theoretically, glucose can be generated through dephosphorylation of glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate catalyzed by glucose-1-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.10) or glucose-6-phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.9). Although these genes have not been identified in PCC 7942, other phosphatases (alkaline phosphatase, Synpcc7942_139 2; inorganic diphosphatase, Synpcc7942_1383 ; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase II/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, Synpcc7942_0505 ; fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Synpcc7942_2335 ; myo-inositol-monophosphatase, Synpcc7942_2582 ) might catalyze the reactions using glucose-1-phosphate or glucose-6-phosphate as non-specific substrates. Considering the amount of accumulated glucose, a more possible route was the sucrose hydrolyzation pathway, through which UDP-glucose and fructose-6-phosphate would be converted into sucrose catalyzed by sucrose-6-phosphate synthase ( sps , Synpcc7942_0808 ), and the generated sucrose could be hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose ( invA , Synpcc7942_0397 ) (Fig. 3a ). To confirm this hypothesis, we knocked out the two genes (SZ130, SZ3- ΔinvA ; SZ131, SZ3- Δ sps ; Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6 ), and found that the growth rate was not affected while glucose secretion was reduced by about 90% to 0.2 g/L (Fig. 3b, c ). The same phenomenon was observed for the SZ17 strain (Fig. 3d ).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image The results indicated that the sucrose synthesis pathway dominated the glucose accumulation in the glucokinase-deficient strains, which was counterintuitive because sucrose synthesis is usually recognized as an inducible physiological protective mechanism to resist hypersaline stress 31 . To investigate if a significant metabolic flux was maintained through the sucrose synthesis pathway in the glucokinase-deficient strains independent of hypersaline stress induction, we constructed an SZ130 derived strain, namely SZ153, carrying a heterologous sucrose transporter sucrose-proton permease (CscB) (Supplementary Figs. 7a, b ), in which the invA deficiency would block the potential sucrose hydrolysation, and the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induced cscB expression could facilitate the secretion of accumulated sucrose (Fig. 4a ). As shown in Fig. 4b , under standard conditions, there was no significant difference between the extracellular glucose produced by the two strains, whereas sucrose was secreted continuously only in SZ153 (to 350 mg/L in 8 d) with IPTG induced cscB expression. By expressing the CscB, the intracellular concentration of sucrose in SZ153 was also decreased from 10 mg/L/OD 730 to about 2 mg/L/OD 730 , while the intracellular glucose concentration was not influenced (Supplementary Figs. 7c, d ). Thus, it could be confirmed that a sucrose synthesis flux was maintained in PCC 7942 cells regardless of hypersaline stress.

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Further experiments revealed that the active sucrose synthesis in PCC 7942 was not related to glucokinase deficiency. The sucrose secretion through CscB under non-hypersaline conditions was also observed for the wild-type background. In the previously constructed strain FL92 (WT- ΔNS3 :: P lac -cscB ) 32 , IPTG-induced cscB expression improved extracellular sucrose secretion. The knockout of invA (named SZ21, Supplementary Fig. 8 ) improved sucrose secretion from 16 to 80 mg/L when no IPTG was added ( cscB expressed under a “leaky” state). When 0.1 mM IPTG was added, sucrose secretion by all three strains further increased to over 190 mg/L, and less glucose secretion was observed in the SZ21 and FL92 strains with functional glucokinases (Fig. 4c ). Based on the above results, we assumed that an active sucrose metabolism cycle existed in PCC 7942 and that the deficiency of glucokinase blocked glucose reutilization and further promoted the subsequent accumulation and secretion. In the sucrose metabolism deficient strains, a certain amount of glucose was still synthesized, indicating that there were additional pathways contributing to the glucose synthesis (e.g., potential non-specific dephosphorylation activity) in PCC 7942. A specific SNP facilitated efficient glucose secretion The glucokinase deficiency resulted in intracellular accumulation of glucose, whereas the mechanisms facilitating subsequent secretion independent of heterologous transporters remained to be disclosed. In the glucokinase deficient strain SZ17, the generated glucose could be exported out of the cells through the heterologous glucose transporter GalP, avoiding over-accumulation of intracellular glucose. In comparison, regarding the SZ3 strain, genomic mutations would be required to facilitate glucose secretion, which could also be an explanation for the long-term passages required for the isolation of the homozygotes. To this end, whole-genome sequencing was performed to identify the functional mutations facilitating glucose secretion in SZ3. Based on published genome information of PCC 7942 (FACHB-805), types of mutations were characterized on the genome of SZ3 and SZ17 (Supplementary Table 1 ), most of which were generated during the preservation and passages of the PCC 7942 strain in our laboratory and were previously identified through genome sequencing assays. Through the comparisons between SZ3 and SZ17, a specific SNP (G274A) was identified on the synpcc7942_1161 gene of the SZ3 genome, on which the 92 nd valine was converted into isoleucine (Fig. 5a ). The knockout of synpcc7942_1161 (G274A) in the SZ3 strain (SZ141, Supplementary Fig. 9 ) reduced the glucose secretion by 78% to 0.33 g/L, thereby demonstrating the essential role of this gene (Fig. 5b ). Fig. 5: Effects of synpcc7942_1161 - G274A mutation on glucose secretion of PCC 7942 strains. a Sanger DNA sequencing of the amplified synpcc7942_1161 gene region of SZ3 and SZ17. b Effect of synpcc7942_1161 gene deficiency on glucose secretion of SZ3 strain. c The construction strategy of the SZ182 strain by introducing the synpcc7942_1161 - G274A mutation into the genome of PCC 7942; SZ181 carrying the same inserted antibiotics resistance marker was used as a control strain.

Data are presented as mean values ± SD. All sample size n (biological replicates) in ( b , d and f ) is 3. All sample size n (biological replicates) in ( c ) is 6. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image Synpcc7942_1161 was annotated to encode a divalent metal transporter with five transmembrane domains (Supplementary Fig. 10 ). Therefore, we hypothesized that the G274A mutation might improve the affinities of glucose to the Synpcc7942_1161 inner membrane exporter, thereby facilitating more efficient glucose secretion in the SZ3 strain. However, a subsequent transcriptome assay suggested more complex effects of the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation. And among the transcripts with significantly elevated abundances in the SZ3 strain, the synpcc7942_1161 transcript was the most significantly up-regulated, reaching up to a 77-fold increase. In addition, four other genes located in the same operon with synpcc7942_1161 were also significantly up-regulated ( synpcc7942_1160 by 37 folds, synpcc7942_1162 by 59 folds, synpcc7942_1163 by 37 folds, and synpcc7942_RS13740 by 34 folds), constituting the top five up-regulated transcripts in SZ3. To explore if the elevated transcriptions were caused by the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation, we introduced this mutation into the PCC 7942 WT genome (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11 ) and examined the transcriptome changes. The results revealed that the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation significantly increased the transcript abundance of three gene-encoding potential transporter proteins (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Data 1 ), which suggested that the enhanced expressions of the operon were likely caused by this mutation. Synpcc7942_1161 abundance seemed to determine the glucose secretion phenotypes because the overexpression of the wild-type gene in the SZ17 strain (SZ192, Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 12 ) increased the glucose production to the level of SZ3. We further replaced the GalP on the chromosome of SZ17 with wild-type synpcc7942_1161 and a mutated version synpcc7942_1161- G274A, obtaining JS155, and JS156, respectively (Fig. 5e ). As shown in Fig. 5f , JS155 and JS156 secreted comparable amounts of glucose into the culture broth, both of which were higher than SZ17. And the intracellular glucose concentrations in the two strains were also slightly improved. Thus, it can also be proposed that the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation promoted glucose secretion (in SZ3) mainly by elevating transcript abundances of the synpcc7942_1161 rather than optimizing the specific activities of the respective transporter. Besides, we further evaluated and compared the stability of synpcc7942_1161 mRNA in JS155 and JS156 under the control of the Plac promoter, and no difference was found between the two versions of synpcc7942_1161 mRNA with or without the G274A mutation (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Thus, it could be speculated that the elevated abundances of synpcc7942_1161 transcripts were due to the increased transcription activities rather than the optimization of transcript stability. We also assumed that the mutated synpcc7942_1161 might contribute to a unidirectional transport function of intracellular glucose because the PCC 7942 WT strain carrying the synpcc7942_1161 -G274A mutation could not absorb glucose (Supplementary Fig. 14 ). Based on the above results, we assumed a model for the generation of the glucokinase-deficient strain SZ3. As shown in Fig. 6 , the glucokinase deficiency blocked the glucose-6-phosphate ↔ glucose cycle, and it enriched the spontaneous mutation of synpcc7942_1161 -G274A. The synpcc7942_1161 -G274A might promote glucose secretion by increasing the abundance or activity of the Synpcc7942_1161 inner membrane exporter, which initiated the glucose secretions more efficiently. Finally, the elevated glucose secretions buffered the potential feedback stress and enabled the isolation of the final homozygote of SZ3.

Full size image Engineering for enhanced and prolonged glucose production The global RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that transcriptome was remodeled in SZ3, and expressions of 581 genes were significantly regulated (227 up-regulated and 354 down-regulated, Supplementary Data 2 ) compared with WT. Enrichment analysis revealed that the pathways involved in photosynthesis and oxidative phosphorylation were significantly regulated ( p value < 0.01) in SZ3 (Supplementary Fig. 15 ), and that was consistency with the weakened photosynthesis activities (oxygen evolution rates; Supplementary Fig. 16 ) in SZ3 compared with WT. Meanwhile, many genes participating in nitrogen metabolism and amino acids metabolism in SZ3 also show changed transcription levels, which were associated with the active “carbon spilling” status in the glucokinase deficiency strain, especially for those tightly associated with nitrogen metabolism. To further elucidate the effects of glucokinase deficiency metabolism, untargeted metabolomics assays were performed between SZ3 and the wild-type. Through LC-MS/MS assays, 116 differentiated metabolites were identified (Supplementary Data 3 , 4 ). Consistent with the transcriptome change, several amino acids concentration inside SZ3 were changed. For example, concentrations of arginine, glutamate, and glutamine, which are involved in the ornithine-ammonia cycle 33 , were all reduced by over 50% (Fig. 7 ). Another representative metabolomics characteristic of the glucokinase-deficient strain SZ3 was the increased abundance of sugar compounds and decreased content of phosphorylated metabolites (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3 ). This phenomenon indicated that glucokinases might function as non-specific phosphorylases with broader substrates in the PCC 7942 metabolism, which could also explain the difficulty to isolate the glucokinase-deficient homozygotes. To confirm this hypothesis, we purified Glk1 and Glk2 of PCC 7942 and evaluated the activities of the two enzymes on phosphorylating sugars other than glucose. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 17 , both the two glucokinases showed phosphorylation activities on some other sugars besides glucose. The unspecific activities of Glk2 toward the eight sugars all exceed 20% (of the specific activity for glucose), reaching up to 50% for fructose, mannose, and galactose. The in vitro assay results provided further evidence for the hypothesis that glucokinases may play an important role in phosphorylating and recycling sugars in PCC 7942. In addition, several phosphorylated metabolites with decreased concentrations (ribulose-5-phosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate) are involved in the CBB cycle (Fig. 7 ), for which the decreased abundances could also be a result of the carbon flow deprivation caused by the glucose synthesis & secretion.

Full size image Regarding the sucrose-metabolism pathway directly supporting the glucose synthesis, the abundance of the important intermediate metabolites was differently regulated, indicating an unbalanced catalytic route (Fig. 7 ). Compared to the wild-type control, the intracellular sucrose concentration decreased by 74.3%, whereas that of fructose increased by eightfold. These results indicate a strong driving force for glucose secretion and enhanced fructose output, which exceeded the conversion capacity of native fructokinase. The concentrations of most upstream metabolites generally decreased (by 88.3% for glucose-1-phosphate, 88.4% for glucose-6-phosphate, 69.9% for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and 97.7% for fructose-6-phosphate), except for UDP-glucose (2.93-fold increase). The functional enzymes responsible for the conversion of glucose-1-phosphate into UDP-glucose have not been identified in PCC 7942 34 . Therefore, the mechanisms causing the UDP-glucose over-accumulation should be further investigated in future studies. To further improve the glucose photosynthetic production, several essential enzymes of the sucrose metabolism pathways were individually overexpressed. As shown in Fig. 8 , the bifunctional sucrose-6-phosphate synthase/sucrose-6-phosphotase (catalyzing the synthesis of sucrose-6-phosphate and sucrose from fructose-6-phosphate and UDP-glucose), the invertase (catalyzing the degradation of sucrose into fructose and glucose), the phosphoglucose isomerase (catalyzing the conversion between fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate), the phosphoglucose mutase (catalyzing the conversion between glucose-1-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate), the fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (catalyzing the conversion from fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) were all individually overexpressed in the SZ3 strain. Most recombinant strains performed enhanced glucose production, improving extracellular glucose concentrations from approximately 1.6 to 2 g/L during a 16-18 days cultivation process. The only exception was the overexpression of fructokinase, for which glucose secretion was decreased. A possible explanation is that the increased fructokinase enzymes catalyzed glucose as a non-specific substrate and restored the previously blocked glucose/phosphoglucose cycle (Supplementary Fig. 18 ), leading to the reduction of the glucose synthesis branch.

Extracellular glucose production and cell density of mutant strains calculated after a 15–18 d cultivation. The results for SZ145 and SZ150 are the extracellular glucose production from the 16th and 15th day of culture, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test ( * * p < 0.01, **** p < 0.0001). The p values are (from left to right) 0.0029, 0.0026, 0.0011, 0.0049, <0.0001, 0.0017, <0.0001. Data are presented as mean values ± SD. All sample size n (biological replicates) is 3. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Full size image As mentioned above, the optimization of carbon supply and illumination strengths improved the glucose production of SZ3 and SZ17 strains, as well as the biomass accumulation rates. We used the SZ123 strain to improve glucose production by cultivation optimization, and the results showed improved biomass and glucose production (from 2 to 2.9 g/L; Fig. 9a ; Supplementary Fig. 19 ) using concentrated (2×) BG11 culture medium 35 . For prolonged glucose synthesis, we adopted a fed-batch strategy by re-suspending the glucose-synthesizing cells (meaning harvesting the cells and suspending the cells with fresh medium) for every 12 d. This strategy effectively prolonged the glucose-synthesizing activities of the SZ123 cells (Fig. 9b ) and led to the accumulation of 5 g/L glucose after 3 batches, which took up over 70% of the carbon flux fixed by the recombinant Synechococcus cells (Supplementary Fig. 20 ). The glucose accumulation rates gradually decreased with the decline in cell density. Therefore, the cellular robustness of the recombinant cell factories to maintain stable growth and metabolism in long-term cultivation is the main factor for the control of glucose production. Accordingly, future systematic solutions to strain and cultivation engineering should further improve these aspects.

Full size image Discussion In this work, we unlocked the potential of cyanobacterial photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide directly into glucose. Photosynthesis is the most extensive biochemical process on Earth, and photoautotrophs convert solar energy and carbon dioxide into primary organic carbon to support the maintenance of the biosphere 36 . Currently, the refining of sugar-rich plant/algal biomass serves as the dominating route to produce sugar in large quantities, meeting the needs of the food and medicine areas as well as the biorefinery industry 8 , 9 . The “one-pot, one-step” mode of cyanobacterial photosynthetic production could serve as a more continual, stable, and efficient sugar alternative than the “plants-biomass-sugar” route 37 . Most cyanobacteria species can naturally synthesize and accumulate sugar-type compatible solutes to resist abiotic environmental stress 38 . The accumulation and secretion of these compatible sugar compounds (such as sucrose and trehalose) by cyanobacteria can be optimized through genetic manipulation 20 , 21 , and biotechnology application scenarios such as the development of artificial consortia are explored and expanded 39 , 40 . However, glucose, the most representative and important monosaccharide molecule, cannot be efficiently synthesized and accumulated in cyanobacteria. Recently, glucose secretion (accompanied by sucrose secretion) has been observed in a PCC 7942 mutant with deleted xpk gene (which encodes phosphoketolase). However, this glucose synthesis can only be triggered in the dark with salts stress conditions, and the titer is rather limited, reaching approximately 3 mM by high-density cells (the initial OD 730 is 20, and the final average productivity of 0.027 g/L/OD 730 ) 24 . In another, earlier reported work, the titer of salt-induced glucose synthesis (accompanied by fructose secretion) reached only 30 μM (productivity of 0.027 g/L/OD 750 ) in PCC 7942 by overexpressing sucrose hydrolase and hexose transporters 23 . In contrast, continuous synthesis of glucose during the rapid photoautotrophic growth phase was achieved in this work, with productivity higher than 0.27 g/L/OD 730 , by simply removing the glucokinase activities in Synechococcus cells, meaning tenfold higher photosynthetic productivities in the absence of any heterologous catalytic enzymes or transporters and independent of any environmental stress inductions. Although a majority of the isolated cyanobacteria species perform autotrophic metabolism and are deficient to absorb and utilize exogenous glucose as the carbon source, some cyanobacteria strains are capable of using glucose 41 , 42 . As for the cyanobacteria strains able to perform heterotrophic or mixotrophic metabolism using glucose, glucokinase plays an essential role in phosphorylating glucose and initiating the diverse glycolytic processes 43 , 44 . However, glucokinase genes are ubiquitous in the vast majority of the sequenced cyanobacterial genomes (Supplementary Data 5 ). For example, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which has been shown to lack the capacity to absorb and utilize exogenous glucose, has two glucokinase genes on its genome, implying that glucokinase has more physiological functions than glucose utilization. Through systematic genetic modifications, we identified an active and stable glucose-phosphoglucose cycle in PCC 7942, which was maintained in the sucrose metabolism pathway. Previously, sucrose synthesis and accumulation were generally recognized as a salt-stress responsive mechanism to resist hyperosmotic stress 31 , 45 . In contrast, we demonstrated in this work that the synthesis-degradation cycle of sucrose in PCC 7942 remains active independent of salts stress induction, and the glucokinase activity performs as a “floodgate” to avoid the overaccumulation of glucose, which is an intermediate in the sucrose metabolism network and has a potential impact on the photosynthetic metabolism. Besides sucrose metabolism, some other non-specific reactions may also contribute to the synthesis and accumulation of glucose in PCC 7942. Thus, it could be assumed that intracellular glucose synthesis may be continuously maintained in PCC 7942, whereas glucokinase was crucial to recycle glucose into the central metabolism network by a phosphorylation process, and this mechanism can potentially rescue the potential energy loss and metabolism disturbance caused by glucose secretion and accumulation. In addition, although cell growths and photosynthesis were not inhibited (Supplementary Fig. 16 ), glucokinase--deficient strains showed improved sensitivity to 150 mM NaCl (Supplementary Fig. 21 ), indicating that the stable glucose-phosphoglucose cycle contributes to the rapid response of PCC 7942 toward salt stress. Previously it has been proven that the ionic effect is important for inducing sucrose accumulation in PCC 7942, whereby an elevated ion concentration directly activates the sucrose-synthesizing enzyme Sps and simultaneously inhibits the sucrose-degrading enzyme Inv 31 . The maintenance of the sucrose metabolism cycle permitted the direct activity-regulation of ion concentrations on the enzymes, and the glucokinase activities could guarantee the rapid re-utilization of sugars (fructose and glucose) from hydrolyzed sucrose (activity of Inv would be reduced rather than completely removed by elevated ion concentrations). An important issue in microbial metabolic engineering is the adaptation of chassis cells to artificial pathways and genomic modifications. The in-plugged and rewired metabolic activities can disturb carbon distribution, co-factor supply, and redox balances of the native cellular metabolism, and are prone to stimulate the responses of the host cells on levels of physiology, metabolism, and even genetics 46 , which should be relieved through metabolic designs and engineering. Transporter engineering has become a universal strategy to increase the adaptability of microbial chassis cells to heterologous pathways, which could promote product secretion, relieve the metabolic burden of intracellular over-accumulation and reduce the potential inhibitory effect of the products 47 . An alternative solution was suggested in this study. To achieve effective glucose transport, we introduced a heterologous transporter GalP on the chromosome of PCC 7942, which reduced the potential intracellular metabolic or physiological stress and facilitated the convenient and smooth acquisition of the genetic transformants (SZ17). In comparison, without introducing heterologous transporters, a spontaneous mutation ( Synpcc7942_1161 -G274A) was generated and enriched during the long-term cultivation process and endowed the mutant strain with even better capacities for glucose synthesis and secretion. Combining artificial genetic modifications with metabolic stress-induced spontaneous genomic mutations might rewire the metabolic flow more effectively. In summary, we identified the key factors restricting the natural potential of cyanobacteria for the photosynthetic production of glucose. Without heterologous catalysis or transportation genes, a large portion of photosynthetically fixed carbon dioxide in the engineered strain with deficient glucokinase activities and a spontaneous genome mutation was rewired into the secretory production of glucose. The discoveries shed light on developing and industrializing more directional and continuous glucose production systems with solar energy and carbon dioxide. Methods Plasmid construction All endogenous genes were PCR amplified from the wild-type PCC 7942 genome using gene-specific primers and high-fidelity DNA polymerase (TransGen, Beijing, China). All primers used in this study and the constructed plasmids are listed in Supplementary Data 6 . The E. coli strain DH5α was used to construct the plasmids, and all strains were grown at 37 °C in the Luria-Bertani medium (liquid or agar petri dish) supplemented with corresponding antibiotics (Solarbio). Ampicillin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, gentamycin, and chloramphenicol were used at 100, 50, 50, 40, and 50 µg/mL, respectively, for strains with corresponding resistance genes. All backbone vectors were defined based on pUC19 or pBR322 by inserting homologous regions, promoters, and antibiotic resistance cassettes with restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation or seamless cloning. The homologous-recombination regions in all plasmids were located at approximately 1000 bp upstream sequence and 1000 bp downstream sequence of the integrated gene locus. Eco RI, Xba I, Eco RV, Nae I, Eag I, and Bam HI were the restriction cloning sites used to construct pSS1 and pSS2. All restriction enzymes were fast digestion enzymes from Thermo Fisher Science (Shanghai, China). The plasmids were constructed using the seamless cloning method and the Seamless Assembly Cloning Kit (Taihe Biology Co., LTD, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. E. coli colonies with positive plasmids were confirmed by colony PCR using gene-specific primers and Taq DNA polymerase (TransGen Biotech). Plasmids purified with a Mini-prep kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek) were checked by Sanger sequencing before the PCC 7942 transformation. Construction and cultivation of PCC 7942 derived strains The genetic modifications of the PCC 7942 genome were performed using a double homologous recombination system to integrate the genes into the target sites. All plasmids were transformed into PCC 7942 through the natural transformation. Transformants grown on antibiotic selective plates were analyzed by PCR and second-generation DNA sequencing of the amplified fragments 32 . The PCC 7942 derived strains constructed in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 7 . PCC 7942 derived strains were inoculated into liquid BG11 medium containing corresponding antibiotics and cultivated for 4–6 d under rotary shaking (150 rpm) and white-light illumination of 50 µmol photons/m 2 /s at 30 °C. Subsequently, the culture broth was inoculated into 200 mL of BG11 medium in 250 mL flasks under continuous white light of 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s and bubbled with air. Kanamycin, spectinomycin, gentamicin, and chloramphenicol were added into the medium for final concentrations of 20, 20, 2, and 10 µg/mL, respectively. Finally, the culture broth from the flasks was centrifuged and resuspended with 65 mL fresh BG11 culture medium to the initial OD 730 of approximately 2.0 in column photobioreactors (with a diameter of 3 cm). Except when specifically noted, the cultivations for photosynthetic glucose production were performed at 30 °C. During the long-term cultivation experiment, antibiotics were eliminated, 8 mM TES-NaOH (pH = 8) was added to maintain the pH of the culture, and the genotypes of the cells were checked by PCR at the end of the cultivation. During the cultivation process, 0.5 mL of culture broth was sampled from each column photobioreactor every other day to measure the OD 730 and glucose concentrations, and sterile water was supplemented to maintain the original volume. For special experiments, the organic carbon contents (citric acid and ferric ammonium citrate) would be removed from the BG11 medium. Glucose production To determine the extracellular glucose contents secreted by the PCC 7942 derived strains, the culture broth was sampled and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Then the glucose concentrations in the supernatant were calculated using the D-glucose assay kit (Megazyme) or ICS5000+ (DIONEX, Thermo Scientific, USA) ion-exchange chromatography system equipped with an electrochemical detector and a Dionex CarboPac MA1 analytical column (4×250 mm, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Intracellular glucose was extracted from cellular pellets following a previous study 48 . In brief, the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL 80% ethanol (volume to volume) and then incubated at 65 °C for 4 h. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried under a stream of N 2 at 55 °C. Subsequently, the dry residues were dissolved in ultrapure water, and the dissolved solution was filtered into clean vials with a 0.22 μm filtration membrane. Glucose contents in the filtrate were also calculated using the D-glucose assay kit (Megazyme) or ion chromatography. Glucokinase activity Glucokinase activity was measured by a modified enzyme-linked assay 3 . Synechococcus cells cultivated in BG11 medium were centrifuged and resuspended in 1 mL of breakage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) pre-cooled to 4 °C. Quartz sand (Sigma) was added to the cell suspension, and the cells were disrupted by vortex mixing at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, 60 µL of the supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate, to which 200 µL of a reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM NADP + , 10 mM glucose, and 5 U/mL glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured every 5 min in the dark. The slope of A 510 , which increased with time, was calculated, and the specific enzyme activity of glucokinase in the reaction mixture was calculated according to the Lambert-Beer law. The 13 C labeling cultivation The 13 C labeling experiments were performed using 13 C labeled sodium bicarbonate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, 99% 13 C, CLM-441), and 12 C-NaHCO 3 was added as a control. First, cells at the exponential growth phase were adjusted to an OD 730 of 0.6 in 10 mL BG11 including 50 mM NaHCO 3 and appropriate antibiotics, and then cultivated in 30 mL sealed flasks (with no headspace) with or without citric acid and ammonium ferric citrate under continuous light conditions. For assays of the intracellular metabolites, cells were collected by centrifugation every 24 h, extracted rapidly with 2 mL of 80:20 methanol/water (vol/vol), and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. Intracellular metabolites were extracted via the freeze/thaw cycle five times. After centrifugation and nitrogen blowing, 100 µL ddH 2 O was added to the sample for resuspension and was taken for derivatization reaction. The sample derivatization was carried out in two steps: (1) adding 40 µL methoxyamine solution (25 mg/mL, dissolved in pyridine solvent) and then incubating at 60 °C for 30 min. (2) 40 µL TMS reagent (BSTFA/TMCS, 99:1) was added to each sample and then reacted at 37 °C for 120 min. For assays of the extracellular glucose, 100 µL supernatant of SZ3 culture broth was taken for freeze-drying and derivatization respectively. After centrifugation, GC-MS was performed to analyze the samples. GC-MS assays were carried out by Agilent 7890, equipped with Agilent 5977 mass detector and HP-INNOWax column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm). Ultra-pure helium was used as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 3 mL/min. The temperature of the column box was initially kept at 60 °C for 5 min, increased to 260 °C at a rate of 10 °C /min, and then kept at 260 °C for 10 min. Characteristic mass signals from glucose were detected at m/z 204(M + 0), 205(M + 1), 206(M + 2), and then were calculated based on the ratio of labeled metabolites to unlabeled, to analyze related intermediates and to detect the labeled ratio of glucose in cells per unit time. Genome sequencing For whole-genome re-sequencing of SZ3 and SZ17, genomic DNA was isolated and analyzed for qualities and concentrations using the Nanodrop ND-1000 system (Thermo Scientific, US) and Qubit fluorometer (Thermo Scientific, US). Subsequently, quantified DNA samples were fragmented, blunted, modified with 3ʹ-A overhangs, ligated to Illumina’s standard sequencing adapters, and amplified by PCR. The library was sequenced as paired-end reads using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer. Library constructions and sequencing were performed by Allwegene Tech (Beijing, China). The reference sequence ( Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, FACHB-805) was obtained from the GenBank for read mapping. BWA 49 was used to reference sequences, and SAMtools 50 was used to sort the results and mark duplicate reads. Subsequently, SNPs and structure variation (SV) between reference sequences and sample sequences were identified by SAMtools and BreakDancer 51 , respectively. Then, DNA fragments containing SNPs and SV were amplified from the genomic DNA and further verified by Sanger sequencing. Synpcc7942_1161 mRNA stability evaluation Synechococcus cells cultivated in flasks shaken under 50 μmol photons/m 2 /s white fluorescent light at 30 °C. Cells in the log phase were harvested and resuspended to an OD 730 of 4. Actinomycin D (ActD, 5 μg/mL) was added to block de novo mRNA synthesis and total RNA was isolated at indicated time points (0, 5, 25, and 45 min) after adding ActD using a bacterial RNA extraction kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). The RNA samples were then reverse transcribed into cDNA using HiScript III RT SuperMix for qPCR (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a LightCycler 480 Sequence Detector (Roche, Basel, Switzerland; LightCycler 480 software 1.5) based on SYBR Green I fluorescence (ChamQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix-Vazyme, Nanjing, China). Untargeted metabolomics analysis Synechococcus cells cultured to the 8th day under standard cultivation conditions (30 °C, 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply) were centrifuged and washed three times with a phosphate buffered saline buffer (Supplementary Fig. 22 ). The cell pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen for 15 min and then stored at −80 °C until the analysis. Afterward, 200 µL of ddH 2 O and 800 µL of an acetonitrile-methanol mixture (1:1) were added to 80 mg of cell pellets. After vortexing for 1 min, all samples were stored at −20 °C for 1 h for protein precipitation. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Subsequently, 100 µL of resuspension solution (0.1% formic acid in ddH 2 O) was added and vortexed for 30 s. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.22 µm membrane. To ensure the quality of the metabolomics analysis, quality control (QC) samples were prepared by mixing six replicates in each group. For the untargeted metabolomics analysis, samples were injected into an Agilent 1290 Infinity Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH Amide column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.7 µm particle size) and detected with an AB Triple TOF 5600/6600 mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization (ESI) source (AB SCIEX, Canada). The temperature of the column was maintained at 25 °C. The gradient mobile phase was a mixture of 25 mM ammonium acetate and 25 mM ammonia in water for mobile phase A, and acetonitrile for mobile phase B, at a flow rate of 0.30 mL/min. The proportion of mobile phase B was optimized as 0–0.5 min, 95% B; 0.5–7 min, 95%–65% B; 7.0–8.0 min, 65%–40% B; 8.0–9.0 min, 40% B; 9.0–9.1 min, 40%–95% B; 9.1–12 min, 95% B. A scan range from 50 to 1200 m/z (mass-charge ratio) was adopted for the mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The ion spray voltage was set to +5 kV for the positive ionization mode (ESI + ) and -5 kV for the negative mode (ESI-). The collision energy was set to +15 and –15 eV for ESI+ and ESI-, respectively. The declustering potentials were set to +60 V (ESI+) and –60V (ESI–), and the source temperature was 650 °C. The raw LC-MS data was converted by the ProteoWizard software and introduced into an XCMS for peak identification, matching, and integration. Compound identification of metabolites by MS/MS spectra with an in-house database established with available authentic standards. The identified metabolites were further searched against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database for the metabolic pathway analysis. Subsequently, data were pre-processed by Pareto-scaling for the principal component analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The one-dimensional statistical analysis included the student’s t test and multiple variation analysis. Transcriptome profiling Synechococcus cells cultured to the 4th day under standard cultivation conditions (30 °C, 100 µmol photons/m 2 /s, air bubbling for carbon supply) were centrifuged and washed with DNase/RNase-free water (Supplementary Fig. 23 ). Cell pellets were collected and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen for 15 min. TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) was used for total RNA extraction from frozen cell pellets (three biological replicates in each group). The RNA quality and concentration were analyzed using the Nanodrop ND-1000 system (Thermo Scientific, USA) and Agilent 2100 RAN NANO 6000 Assay kit (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Paired-end libraries were prepared using the RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina). The enriched mRNA was fragmented by adding a fragmentation buffer, and the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and reverse transcriptase, for which mRNA fragments were used as templates, followed by second-strand cDNA synthesis using DNA polymerase I, RNaseH, buffer, and dNTPs. The synthesized double-stranded cDNA fragments were then purified using a QIAQuick PCR kit. The purified double-stranded cDNA was poly-adenylated and adapter-ligated to prepare the paired-end library. The adaptor-ligated cDNA and adaptor primers were used for PCR amplification. Finally, the Illumina platform was applied to sequence the resulting cDNA libraries, and 150 bp paired-end reads were obtained. Clean reads were trimmed from raw reads, and all downstream analyses were based on the clean reads. By using the Bowtie 2 software, paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome of Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. The number of reads corresponding to each gene was calculated using FeatureCounts 52 . Subsequently, every gene’s fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) were calculated based on the length of the gene and the reads count mapped to this gene. Genes with p -adj <0.05 and |log 2 foldchange | > log 2 (1.5) were defined as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Protein expression and purification The Glk1 ( Synpcc7942_0221 ), Glk2 ( Synpcc7942_2111 ), and Fk ( Synpcc7942_0116 ) genes were amplified from the PCC 7942 genome and cloned into the pET28a, generating the recombinant expression plasmids pYW16, pJS89 and pJS90, respectively. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) for the overproduction of target proteins. The transformants were grown in 500 mL LB medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C. At an OD 600 of 0.6–0.8, cells were induced by 0.3 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 20 h. After induction, cells were then harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in prechilled lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8). The lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 60 min, and the resulting supernatants were filtered through 0.22 μm polyethersulfone membranes and then loaded on a Ni Sepharose 6 FF column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL) for affinity purification. The typical bind-wash-elute procedure was then used to get the target proteins. Protein concentration in the fractions was determined by the Bradford method, and the purity of target proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE. Sugar phosphorylating activities assays The phosphorylating activities of glucokinase and fructokinase on different sugar substrates were measured by using the pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase (PK/LDH) enzyme-linked assay as previously described with modifications 53 . In brief, 20 µL of the purified protein was transferred to a 96-well plate, to which 210 µL of a reaction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 2.5 mM ATP, 4 mM MgCl 2 , 20 mM KCl, 0.3 mM NADP + , 10 mM specific sugar, 1 mM PEP, 1.4 U/mL PK, 2.8 U/mL LDH) was added, and the absorbance at 340 nm was measured every 15 s during 1 h in the dark. The slope of A 510 , which decreased with time, was calculated, and the specific enzyme activity of glucokinase/fructokinase on each sugar would be compared to the activities on glucose/fructose to get the relative ratios. Glucokinase genes distributions analysis To comprehensively investigate the genomic Glucokinase sequences of cyanobacteria, we downloaded all available cyanobacterial genomic sequences and their annotation from the NCBI assembly database using the NCBI-datasets tools. A total of 986 no-redundantly reference-level cyanobacteria genomes were used to construct the genome database. The genome database was screened using the hmmsearch tool of the Hmmer package (version 3.1b2) 54 , and potential Glucokinase sequences from 947 cyanobacterial genomes were retrieved to show significant matches with this Glucokinase HMM (PF02685) with E values < 1 –50 (Supplementary Data 5 ). Photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates and respiration rates Synechococcus cells were harvested and resuspended with 17 mL fresh BG11 to the initial OD 730 of approximately 2.0. The respiration rates were measured under dark for 200 s at 30 °C and the whole chain photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates were measured for 160 s at each light level (RGB light source) with the YZQ-201A photosynthetic instrument (Yizongqi Technology Co., Ltd, China) in the presence of 10 mM NaHCO 3 . The total photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates were calculated as the net photosynthetic rate plus the respiration rate.

The algae bloom led to the closure of parts of a marina and health warnings in neighboring counties. Swirls and tendrils of blue-green algae can be seen in this image, acquired on June 12, 2023, by the Operational Land Imager-2 (OLI-2) on Landsat 9 . Around this time, a NOAA analysis of Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite data indicated that algae blooms covered about 380 square miles of the lake. That equates to more than half the area of the lake. Blue-green algae, also known as cyanobacteria, are single-celled organisms that rely on photosynthesis to turn sunlight into food. The bacteria grow swiftly when nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen are abundant in still water. The bloom pictured here may contain blue-green algae, as well as other types of phytoplankton; only a surface sample can confirm the exact composition of a bloom. Some cyanobacteria produce microcystin —a potent toxin that can irritate the skin and cause liver and kidney damage. Microcystin was found in water samples taken from the lake on June 17 (five days after the image was acquired), including near the floodgate and canal used to release water into the St. Lucie Estuary on Florida’s southeastern coast. Excess lake water is typically released into the estuary and to farmlands to the south. But in mid-June, amid high lake levels, water managers prevented discharge because of the presence of harmful algae, according to the Miami Herald . The Florida Department of Health in Lee , Martin , and Palm Beach counties issued public health warnings in late June and early July, cautioning residents not to swim or boat in the lake due to the presence of harmful algal toxins.

Recent heavy rains have led to phosphorus runoff and sewage leaks into Vermont lakes and ponds. Cyanobacteria blooms have closed beaches along Lake Champlain multiple times this summer, with warmer water temperatures due to climate change causing the blooms to occur more frequently. Even if the lake looks safe to the eye for a swim, it might not be. Vermont Edition host Mikaela Lefrak spoke with Jeffrey Schloss, the acting extension program leader with the Lake Champlain Sea Grant, an organization which develops and shares scientific knowledge to benefit the Lake Champlain basin. A portion of their conversation is below, and has been edited and condensed for clarity. Mikaela Lefrak: Now, Jeff, when you saw the flooding begin in that second week of July, I'm curious what your first thoughts were as somebody who has monitored water quality in this region for years? Jeffrey Schloss: We know that when we have floods of that magnitude, we tend to see a tremendous amount of movement of materials into Lake Champlain and all the other lakes around Vermont, because of the higher velocity of water and the capability to essentially carry more suspended materials... And so we know that events like that could actually represent close to 80 to 90% of the year's loading of nutrients, for example, coming into lakes that are receiving those waters. So when you when you saw this flooding happen ...  as you're thinking about what what was to come for Lake Champlain, that must have been a must have been a very difficult moment. Well, of course, the real concern was for the flooded communities, and the economic impacts, and the changes to habitat. So that was really my primary concern. But of course, secondarily, we're very interested in what the impacts will be on the lake water quality. We saw for a time after and even continuing now, we have new loads of sediment in the deltas where the rivers come into the lake, where the tributary rivers come in. We also saw from remote sensing, as well as satellite remote sensing as well as our own UVM drone sensing, we saw the tremendous amount of sediments that not only you could see in the in the in the rivers as they were coming into the lake, but you can see in the lake. So there was a tremendous amount of sediment load and of course attached to that sediment, all sorts of nutrients and potential pesticides and other types of pollutants that were delivered to the lake. I believe I saw some of that drone footage . And it's pretty remarkable how visual it is — that you can really see the sediment flowing right into the lake. Yeah, and some of our areas have a lot of very fine clays, which mean that that sediment will stay up in the water column for a very long time before it settles down, since it's such fine material. Some of the heavier materials that are moved essentially just fall right as they enter the lake and create those deltas because they're heavier and the velocity slows down when the river water enters the lake. But those clay particles will be there for a long time. Now, Jeff, I read that state officials said that over the course of a week in July, 130% of the entire phosphorus load from 2022 for the Lamoille River flowed into Lake Champlain. And there was also a lot of runoff coming from the Missisquoi River as well. Talk us through what that means. That sounds like an enormous increase. Yes, that is, and the fact that we still have some summer to go, it'll be interesting to see how the lake reacts. You know, the lake is essentially going to be the reaction vessel where all of that material has now come in. And any of the available nutrients will definitely be worked on by all the various organisms in the lake, and we will be really concerned to see whether or not that will result in in seeing bloom activity occur, depending upon how high the the water remains, as well as how calm we have in terms of the coming weather as we approach the fall. Elodie Reed / Vermont Public File A cyanobacteria bloom is pictured on Lake Champlain in St. Albans in August 2019. Well, let's talk about those blooms, the cyanobacteria blooms, specifically. Those close down beaches, they affect the ecosystem. What is cyanobacteria? What is a cyanobacteria bloom? Essentially, cyanobacteria are some of the most primitive bacteria, photosynthetic organisms we've had on Earth. In fact, most people attribute the oxygen in our atmosphere that was created to them, since they were the earliest sort of synthetic organisms. They're one of many types of bacteria that are photosynthetic that you can find in waters. They're found all over the place in the oceans and in our waters. Typically they don't become problematic until there's a combination of very warm water as well as a lot of excess nutrients which then drive them to outcompete all the other photosynthetic algae in the water. And, what we then will see is a bloom, sometimes we see blooms because there's just so much productivity occurring, because of the nutrients. Sometimes we see blooms because there are there are smaller amounts of the bacteria that are growing, but then the the wind will push them in, in towards shore into bays and embayments. And so they will collect. They tend to be distributed early on in the bottom waters and sometimes mid-lake depths. And towards the end of the season, we tend to see them come up into the upper area of the water column and collect. You'll definitely see them as greenish, or blue-greenish blooms that sometimes look like small little pin-size balls or, or sometimes looks like spilled paint. There are other types of algae that do bloom, but they tend to be look more stringer and, as opposed to more shinier, or flakier or more kind of bubbly. So they're generally very visual when you see them. And that's when we become most concerned about their accumulation, because they do produce a number of toxins on occasion. Those toxins are either neurotoxins or liver toxins, they also produce other irritants. And there's some people that will react to them by having rashes occur when they come in contact with them. So there are a lot concerned about those toxins, because there are some very acute situations where even if we have small children or small pets drinking water with a bloom with toxins in them, we could see tremendous problems. Dogs have been known to die from drinking lake water. And kids can get very sick. So we're very concerned about about when they accumulate and produce toxins. And again, there are these short term exposure concerns. But we also have some long-term concerns, because we see that long-term exposure has the possibility of causing certain neurological diseases and disorders. More from Vermont Public: ALS And Algae Blooms? Scientists Say A State Registry Is Needed To Study Possible Link OK. So there's the cyanobacteria blooms caused in part by the increase in phosphorus runoff. And then in mid-July, there was a sewer pipe that ran under the Winooski River that broke and at its height, it was spewing 350,000 gallons of wastewater into the Winooski, which feeds into Lake Champlain. That's about 10% of Burlington's total sewage flow. What kind of setback to clean up efforts does a break like that pose? Well, of course, you have the instantaneous concern from the other type of bacteria that we generally post warnings on beaches [about], the fecal coliform bacteria, which are indicators that if we have the presence of sewage coming into the water, especially if people are using it to recreate. There's a very high chance of other pathogenic organisms to be in the water — those organisms, bacteria and viruses that cause disease parasites. So that's the main number one concern right away. Secondarily, of course, you have this large amount of nutrients — wastewater contains a tremendous amount of of phosphorus and nitrogen — untreated wastewater. So we had that concern of additional nutrients coming into the lake besides what was brought in from the sediments and in the runoff from the stormwater and the flooding events. So hearing about that sewage break, did that just make you want to scream? Well, you know, it's very unfortunate that that happens, it was very good that they contained it, as soon as they can. We do have situations in a number of areas around the lake where we still have combined sewer and stormwater systems that overload the the wastewater treatment plants. And essentially, we do have situations during very heavy storms then, that even without a pipe break, we do get combined stormwater runoff with with some septic. So we see that occurring. But the fact that they were able to repair it fast was very helpful. But we will be looking to see what the what the outcome is in terms of that nutrient loading in terms of the lake response. Now, Jeff, I was down in North Beach on Lake Champlain over the weekend, and there were lots of folks swimming in the water and enjoying themselves. But I've also had conversations with folks who say, ""You know, after the flooding in July, after the the sewer line break, I don't want to get in the water right now."" So what's your guidance for folks on how to know when it is safe to swim? Well, there is a cyanobacteria tracker , that takes data from volunteers that work all around the lake that take water samples very often. And I was taking a look at those results just for over the weekend, for example. And even earlier this week, there are some actually from yesterday that aren't showing any heavy blooms — except for areas around St. Albans in that northern part of the lake, which which tends to be problematic all the time. So in terms of cyanobacteria, and they typically also test the beaches themselves — are tested for coliform bacteria to make sure that there wasn't any flow. Because it was relatively dry for a while, generally the ultraviolet sunlight will take care of a lot of pathogenic organisms at the surface in shallow waters. And when we do have rain events that don't bring in a whole mess of material, because they're short-term events that don't cause flooding, we do get at least some flushing of the base and embayments, so that we kind of wash out the cyanobacteria and dilute the other potential problematic organisms in there, and we get the lake flowing. It's really when we have the really quiet times and very hot weather, especially in the shallows and the embayments, or winds that are blowing from the the middle of the lake towards towards shore that we then tend to be concerned about the accumulation of cyanobacteria. So, you know, in general, you can never guarantee what the condition of the water is at any time. Even after it's just been monitored, because everything's moving about and everything's dynamic. But if you don't see a bloom, you shouldn't necessarily be that concerned about cyanobacteria. Because typically — as I said, even some of the blooms don't produce toxins — but we've never measured toxins where we didn't have a boom. Have questions, comments or tips?

Image courtesy of Christine Bunyon Key Finding: Using a multispectral sensor on an unpiloted aerial system (UAS) proved over 90 percent effective in detecting cyanobacteria blooms—also known as harmful algal blooms (HABs)—in New Hampshire waterbodies, offering a safer and faster alternative to traditional water sampling methods. Key Terms: Cyanobacteria: A group of bacteria species known by the common name blue-green algae. Although not considered algae, cyanobacteria possess algal characteristics, such as possessing chlorophyll (allowing them to photosynthesize), forming visible colonies on the water and being either unicellular or multicellular. Learn where cyanobacteria are found. One of the first organisms known to produce oxygen on Earth, cyanobacteria played an important role in oxidizing Earth’s first atmosphere and allowing for the growth of new life. Cyanobacteria are found in nearly every terrestrial and aquatic environment on Earth. They differ from other bacteria in that they contain chlorophyll and phycobilin pigments, such as phycocyanin, resulting in their blue-green color and photosynthetic abilities—among other characteristics. Multispectral sensor: Collects information about the reflected light from objects in the environment, allowing for a comparison with neighboring objects to identify significant distinctions between them. 10-band multispectral sensor: Measures reflected light energy within 10 different wavelengths or bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Multispectral sensors usually have between 3 and 10 band measurements in each pixel of the images they produce. What Causes Cyanobacteria Blooms? Harmful algal blooms (HABs) occur when cyanobacteria species undergo rapid and excessive growth in water bodies. These blooms are fueled by factors like nutrient enrichment from human activities, warm water temperatures, and ample sunlight for photosynthesis. When these conditions align, harmful algae can multiply rapidly, forming dense and visible blooms that may produce toxins harmful to aquatic life and human health. Learn how to check for HABs in New Hampshire. Cyanobacteria blooms both produce and consume large amounts of dissolved oxygen, creating areas of low dissolved oxygen or anoxia in which other aquatic organisms, including fish, struggle to survive. Blooms can also block sunlight to aquatic plants beneath. Some cyanobacteria species have the capability to produce toxins that pose health risks to humans and animals alike. These risks include gastrointestinal problems, skin irritation, respiratory difficulties, and in severe cases, even neurological damage or death. The best way to check if a New Hampshire waterbody has a cyanobacteria advisory is to use the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) interactive “ Healthy Swimmer Mapper ” tool. NHDES also encourages people to report cyanobacteria blooms using their Bloom Report Form . Traditional Methods of Monitoring for Cyanobacteria Blooms The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) actively monitors cyanobacteria blooms in waterbodies across the state. As of July 20, 2023, NHDES had issued warnings or advisories for 27 lakes and ponds, advising the public to avoid these waterbodies. However, the conventional method of monitoring—and, for active blooms, checking to determine if cell concentrations exceed the state threshold of 70,000 cells per milliliter to trigger an advisory—involves time-consuming water sampling and testing, which may also expose environmental specialists to potential risks. Billions of years ago, cyanobacteria were crucial to some of Earth’s first lifeforms that produced oxygen and helped form the planet’s atmosphere. More recently, a changing climate has led to increases in toxic blue-green algae blooms of cyanobacteria in New Hampshire lakes —popular summer getaways for Granite Staters and visitors, and important economic drivers for the state. Traditional monitoring of these blooms involves time-consuming water sampling and testing that can also expose environmental specialists to potential health risks. To overcome these challenges, NH Agricultural Experiment Station scientist Russell Congalton and his team at the UNH Basic and Applied Spatial Analysis Lab have developed a promising alternative for identifying aquatic cyanobacteria blooms—using unpiloted aerial systems (UAS), or drones. Congalton's research team demonstrated that by equipping UAS devices with special sensors, flying them over bodies of water, and collecting and analyzing images of the waterbodies, this enabled the researchers to accurately determine cyanobacteria concentrations based on spectral response. Congalton, a professor at the UNH College of Life Sciences and Agriculture , along with lead author Christine Bunyon ’17 ’23G; postdoctoral researcher Benjamin Fraser ’15 ’17G ’21G; and UNH Extension specialist Amanda McQuaid , published their findings in Remote Sensing . Cyanobacteria Testing: Lab Vs. UAS ""The ‘traditional’ method of testing for cyanobacteria took so much longer because each sample had to be collected and processed individually,” said Bunyon, who works as a project scientist and geographic information system specialist for FB Environmental Associates. “This meant that one at a time, I had to paddle to a site, collect field measurements and a sample, then bring those samples back to a lab and look at them under a microscope—one by one—to physically count the number of cyanobacteria cells.” To assess and validate the remote sensing technology, Bunyon and Fraser spend May through September 2022 conducting tests using UAS devices in six waterbodies in southern New Hampshire: Silver Lake (Hollis, N.H.) and French, Greenwood, Keyser, Showell, and Tucker ponds. The data collection process involved an aerial scan of the lake, performed in a lateral grid pattern, followed by canoeing to selected sample locations to gather water samples.

Click each pin to learn more about the waterbody. Bunyon then tested the samples for cyanobacteria at the UNH Water Quality Analysis Laboratory , which involved analyzing over 180 samples for chlorophyll-a—each sample taking over two days to analyze. Comparatively, the collection and processing of the UAS imagery took significantly less time —about 4.5 times faster—than the traditional water sampling method. The study also revealed a correlation between cyanobacteria cell concentration and concentrations of chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin—the latter being a pigment responsible for the blue-green algae's color. This correlation allowed for the use of spectral data to identify cyanobacteria, chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin concentrations on the water’s surface, aiding in determining potential harm levels. ""Depending on the size of the lake, it might take as little as 10-15 minutes to fly the entire lake. Then using the collected multispectral imagery, we could show state specialists where the problem areas are pretty quickly, and at a very fine scale, which both increases our understanding of these [harmful algal blooms] and reduces our sampling costs,” said Fraser.

Cyanobacteria Testing: A Growing Need McQuaid, who previously served as the NH Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) Beach Inspection Program Coordinator, emphasized the record number of advisories and alerts issued in recent years . In 2022, the NHDES commissioned the Cyanobacterial Plan Advisory Committee to prepare a statewide plan for addressing cyanobacteria, which will be submitted in November . And while more research is needed to overcome limitations such as capturing imagery from the center of larger bodies of water, NH Agricultural Experiment Station research shows that UAS technology offers an important tool for finding and identifying blooms in lakes and ponds. “This was the first study of this kind done within New Hampshire and, when compared to similar studies done elsewhere around the U.S. and world, it examined far more bodies of water to provide us more data to support our findings,” said Congalton. “Christine and Ben flew a total of 22 times and collected and processed over 180 water samples, which was a pretty enormous feat to achieve in just a few months.” This material is based on work supported by the NH Agricultural Experiment Station through joint funding from the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (under McIntire-Stennis award number 1026105) and the state of New Hampshire. This work is co-authored by Christine Bunyon, Benjamin Fraser, Amanda McQuaid, and Russell Congalton.

Initially, the bioreactor containing 3N-BBM medium was inoculated with Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus mixture with a density of 1.0 × 10 4 cells/mL and the consortium was cultivated for 30 days. Then, the bioreactor was semi-continuously fed with liquid digestate with hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 30 days, and the treatment process was continued for the next 15 weeks. The change in the microalgal and cyanobacterial species domination was measured in regular intervals using cell counting with droplet method on a microscope slide. At the end of the experiment, Desmonostoc sp. cyanobacteria (identified with 16S ribosomal RNA genetical analysis) as well as Tetradesmus obliquus green algae along with Rhodanobacteraceae and Planococcaceae bacteria (determined with V3–V4 16sRNA metagenomic studies) dominated the microbial community in the photobioreactor. The experiment demonstrated high treatment efficiency, since nitrogen and soluble COD were removed by 89.3 ± 0.5% and 91.2 ± 1.6%, respectively, whereas for phosphates, 72.8 ± 2.1% removal rate was achieved.

Special attention is paid to the management of waste generated in various production processes 1 , 2 , 3 . Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a leading technology used for organic waste valorization and generation of energy. The anaerobic treatment process has many benefits, mainly production of methane-rich biogas resulting in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 4 . At the same time, each biogas plant generates troublesome byproducts, mainly digestate. Raw digestate contains large amounts of organic solids, is rich in nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) but can also contain heavy metals and other toxic substances. The composition of digestate depends on many different factors, including feedstock composition, digester operating conditions or the source of microbial inoculum. Digestate can be processed in its original form or can be separated into liquid fraction (containing the majority of the volatile solids) and solid fraction (containing mostly insoluble particles). Solid digestate is often composted or processed into fertilizer, while liquid digestate is much more difficult to manage. Importantly, treated liquid digestate, can be re-used in biogas plants to dilute raw waste, which, in turn, could significantly reduce water consumption 5 , 6 . Unfortunately, conventional treatment methods applied to liquid digestate have many shortcomings, including high operating costs, generation of unwanted by-products, or weak nutrient removal 7 . Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for new, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly techniques, to treat liquid effluents generated in biogas plants. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the use of microalgae or microalgae-bacteria consortia systems. Microalgae are a diverse group of photoautotrophic organisms capable to bind CO 2 and convert it into a valuable source of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates stored in biomass. Microalgae and cyanobacteria are able to tolerate and grow in a variety of environments, including liquid digestate. However, only a few types of microalgae (e.g., Tetradesmus sp., Chlorella sp., Desmodesmus sp.) have been reported to survive in such environment 8 , 9 , 10 . The presence of water and nutrients in the digestate allows for a cost-effective microalgae cultivation with simultaneous treatment 11 . It has been shown that microalgae–bacteria consortia are more suitable for digestate treatment than monocultures or microalgal axenic cultures. During photosynthesis, microalgae produce oxygen, further used by aerobic bacteria to mineralize organic compounds. Indigenous bacteria, on the other hand, provide microalgae with carbon dioxide, necessary for their growth. In addition, nitrifying bacteria can oxidize high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen that can be toxic to microalgae and thus improve the removal of nitrogen from the digestate. Through a symbiotic relationship, it is possible to obtain greater removal rates of pollutants and acquire highly valuable biomass 12 , 13 , 14 . To fully incorporate circular economy concept, a lipid-rich microalgal biomass cultivated on the liquid digestate can be further used as a sustainable feedstock for the 3rd and 4th generation biodiesel 7 . The dynamic relationship between bacteria and microalgae during the digestate treatment can be quite complex. It has been noticed that microalgae are able to compete with bacteria for nutrients, mainly in a phosphate-limiting environment 15 . Besides, it was found that the survival of pathogenic bacteria present in the digestate can be limited by various conditions of microalgae cultivation, such as high light intensity, variable pH, an increased concentration of dissolved oxygen or continuous stirring applied in the bioreactor 16 . In the research reported by Sobolewska et al. 10 , a microbial consortium containing Tetradesmus obliquus , Desmodesmus subspicatus and Microglena sp. green algae was reported to efficiently remove both nutrients and organic pollutants from the liquid digestate in a small-scale laboratory installation. The following study summarizes the results of the undiluted liquid digestate treatment performed in a larger-scale photobioreactor operated under conditions closer to industrial implementation. Particular attention was paid to the microbial community and the roles of microalgae, bacteria and cyanobacteria in the treatment process. In contrast to the experiments described by other authors 12 , 17 , 18 , 19 , in this research, pretreatment of the substrate such as dilution or sterilization was not applied. Additionally, rarely used environmental isolates, including Microglena sp. (previously applied only in limited studies 10 ) were employed allowing to achieve high removal rates of both nutrients and organic contaminants. Materials and methods Liquid digestate The digestate was delivered from Warmia Fruit and Vegetable Processing Company Ltd. (Kwidzyn, Poland) as a product generated during anaerobic digestion of corn, peas and bean wastes. The liquid fraction was then obtained by centrifuging the digestate for 10 min at 4000 rpm (4800 G) using a Rotina 420 centrifuge (Hettich, Switzerland). The substrate was not subjected to the initial pre-treatment such as sterilization or dilution as such processes are usually omitted on a technological scale 20 . During the experiment, the liquid digestate was stored at 4 °C in closed plastic containers. Before each batch cycle, the substrate was first brought to room temperature. To confirm substrate stability, a full psychochemical analysis of the liquid digestate was performed 4 times throughout the study period according to the methodology described in “ Chemical and physical analyses ”. The characteristic of the liquid digestate is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 Chemical and physical composition of liquid digestate* Full size table Inoculum Bioreactor was inoculated with Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus microalgae mixture of 1.0 × 10 4 cells/mL cell density. The respective species were isolated, genetically identified and their sequences were deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for the rbcl gene under accession number of ON457158–ON457161, and ON426490–ON42693 for ITS region ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov , accessed on 20 April 2022), which was described by Sobolewska et al. 10 . For the initial microalgae multiplication, a cultivation on Bold Basal Medium with threefold nitrogen concentration (3N-BBM), prepared in accordance with Andersen 21 was used. Photobioreactor design and operation The experiment was carried out semi-continuously in a glass photobioreactor with a 5 L working volume and continuous stirring at 150 rpm (Fig. 1 ). The reactor was illuminated with LED lamps in the 14 h light/10 h dark cycle mode. T8 LED Linio model lamps with the following parameters: 1440 lm (luminous power), 14.5 W (electric power) and 6000 K (color temperature) were employed for the process. The illumination intensity was set at 3500 Lux. A membrane pump (Yasunaga, Japan) delivered air to the reactor at a flow rate of 0.2 L/L/min. Initially, the bioreactor was filled with a 3N-BBM medium, inoculated with a 10% v/v microalgae consortium, and operated in a batch mode for 30 days to increase the biomass concentration. After this period, the reactor was semi-continuously fed with the liquid fraction of the digestate for the next 15 weeks. Hydraulic retention time (HRT) was set to 30 days following the previous experiences 10 , 22 . Once a day, 167 mL of the liquid was withdrawn from the reactor and the same volume of fresh liquid digestate was introduced. As the biomass was not recycled back to the bioreactor, the hydraulic retention time was equal to solid retention time (SRT). Feeding and discharge operation was carried out by a peristaltic pump. Once a week total chemical oxygen demand (tCOD), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity as well as biomass parameters, including optical density (OD), the concentration of chlorophyll a (chl- a ) and the microalgal cell abundance were measured in the effluent. pH, soluble COD (sCOD), ammonium nitrogen, nitrates, nitrites, orthophosphates were determined in the effluent after filtration. The efficiency of nutrient and organic contaminant removal was calculated for steady-state period with Eq. ( 1 ). Steady-state period was defined as an experimental period during which most of the determined indicators were not changing by more than 10%. The removal efficiency of individual indicators was calculated assuming theoretical, complete separation of microalgal biomass. $$ {\text{R}}\left[ \% \right] = \left( {{\text{c}}_{{1}} {-}{\text{c}}_{{2}} } \right) \times {1}00/{\text{c}}_{{1}} $$ (1) Where R—removal efficiency of an indicator (PO 4 3− ; NH 4 + , NO 3 − , NO 2 − (total nitrogen); COD); c 1 —concentration of an indicator in the fresh liquid digestate; c 2 —concentration of an indicator in the effluent. Figure 1 Installation with a photobioreactor used for the experiment. Full size image Analytical methods Chemical and physical analyses All chemical analyses were performed using an UV–VIS DR6000 spectrophotometer (Hach Lange, Loveland, CO, USA) and Hach Lange tests. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand, total volatile fatty acids, nitrates, nitrites, ammonium nitrogen and orthophosphates were measured by LCK214, LCK365, NitraVer 5, NitriVer 3 tests, a modified Nessler method (no. 8038) and a PhosVer 3 test (no. 8048), respectively. The contents of nitrogen in ammonium nitrogen, nitrates and nitrites were then summed up to calculate the total nitrogen (Eq. 2 ). Measurements of organic nitrogen forms were not performed considering the fact that liquid digestate primarily consists of ammonium nitrogen and only low amounts of organic nitrogen forms 23 , 24 . The concentration of chlorides, sulfides and sulfates were measured by a thiocyanate method no. 8113, a methylene blue method no. 8131 and a SulfaVer 4 method no. 8051, respectively. In addition, an AluVer method no. 8012 (for aluminum), CuVer 1 method no. 8506 (for cooper), FerroVer method no. 8008 (for iron), Zincon method no. 8009 (for zinc) were applied. The Hach Lange kits were applied to diluted samples to match detection ranges of the tests used. Final indicator values were calculated including the dilution factor used. The color, turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) were assessed in accordance with 8025, EN ISO 7027 and 8006 methods, respectively. Total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS) and pH were examined in accordance with Standard Methods 25 . Biomass productivity was calculated in accordance to methodology described in Min et al. 26 based on TSS values: $$ {\text{Total nitrogen }}\left[ {{\text{mgN}}/{\text{L}}} \right] \, = \, 0.{778} \times {\text{ cNH}}_{{4}}^{ + } + \, 0.{226 } \times {\text{ cNO}}_{{3}}^{ - } + \, 0.{3}0{4 } \times {\text{ cNO}}_{{2}}^{ - } $$ (2) Where 0.778—nitrogen molar mass to NH 4 + molar mass ratio; 0.226—nitrogen molar mass to NO 3 − molar mass ratio; 0.304—nitrogen molar mass to NO 2 − molar mass ratio; c [mg/L]—concentration of a respective nitrogen form (NH 4 + /NO 3 − /NO 2 − ). Biomass analysis Optical density Optical density was measured at 680 nm, which correlated with the second peak of chlorophyll absorption, and reflected the concentration of biomass in the cell suspension 27 . This value was also confirmed experimentally by scanning microalgal culture in the absorption spectrum between 540 and 900 nm. The analysis was performed using a UV–VIS DR6000 spectrophotometer (Hach Lange, Loveland, CO, USA). Quantitative and qualitative microalgae–cyanobacteria structure in photobioreactor The density of microalgal and cyanobacterial cells in the bioreactor was established using a droplet method on a microscope slide. Only healthy, active cells were counted. The abundance of cells was calculated based on Eq. ( 3 ). Additionally, the percentage share of the individual taxa in examined biomass was ascertained. $$\mathrm{Dx }[{\text{cells}}/{\text{mL}}] = (\mathrm{zi }\times \mathrm{ Ap})/(\mathrm{Ai }\times \mathrm{ V})$$ (3) where Dx—the density of cells in 1 mL of culture, zi—cell number of particular taxa, Ap—the cover-slip surface area (= 400 mm 2 ), Ai—the surface area observed under the microscope (mm 2 ), V—the sample volume placed on a microscope slide (cm 2 ). Chlorophyll a concentration To determine the chlorophyll a concentration, the procedure according to Lee et al. 28 was used. After extraction performed with a 90% methanol solution, the absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at the wavelengths of 665 nm and 650 nm. For these measurements, a 10 mm path length of the cuvette was applied. The chlorophyll a concentration was calculated based on Eq. ( 4 ): $$ {\text{chl - }}a\left[ {{\text{mg}}/{\text{L}}} \right] = \left( {{16}.{5} \times {\text{A}}_{{{665}}} } \right) - \left( {{8}.{3} \times {\text{A}}_{{{65}0}} } \right) $$ (4) Taxonomic analysis of cyanobacteria Cultivation of Desmonostoc has been done to multiply its biomass in the form of unialgal culture, prior to isolation of its DNA, to obtain high DNA yields of good quality. Isolation of cells and multiplication of strain biomass for DNA isolation protocols is a standard procedure, widely used in algal molecular characterization. The cyanobacteria taxa from bioreactor were identified using an integrated morphological and molecular approach. Individual trichomes were isolated using microcapillary and inverted light microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E, Precoptic Co., Warsaw, Poland) via passaging through a series of BG-11 drops to washed out excess of bacteria and transferred into sterile 1.5% BG-11 agar plates. Biological material was cultivated under artificial light from fluorescent tubes (Osram FLUORA T8 L 36W/77) of 2800 Lux in a 16 h/8 h day/night period, with a temperature of 22  ± 0.2 °C and air humidity of 50 ± 5%. The genomic DNA was isolated using DNeasy PowerBiofilm Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The 16S rRNA molecular region was amplified by PCR reaction, using primers 359F 29 and 23S30R 30 with Color Perpetual Taq PCR Master Mix (Eurx, Gdansk, Poland) in 50 μL reaction volume under the reaction conditions as in Nowicka-Krawczyk et al. 31 . The results of PCR were visualized on 1.5% agarose gel and the sample was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The sample was sequenced commercially using Sanger Sequencing and the primers of PCR reaction. The sequences were assembled and clean up in Geneious software ver.11.0.15 and screened using BLAST in nucleotide collection of NCBI GenBank database. Obtained sequence was submitted to GenBank under the OQ792152 accession number. Determination of microcystins To confirm whether Desmonostoc sp. cyanobacteria, present in the tested culture do not produce cyanotoxins and can only positively contribute to nitrogen and phosphorous removal, a HPLC-DAD analysis was conducted for the presence of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and microcystin-RR (MC-RR). To analyze the microcystin (MC) content in freshwater material, the 13 mL of sample was filtered through GF/C Whatmann filter. The material collected on the filter was extracted in a 75% solution of aqueous methanol and then the sample was sonicated for 30 s in the Misonix (Farmingdale, NY, USA) ultrasonicator with a ultrasonic liquid processor XL. The extract was then centrifuged twice at 11,000× g for 10 min at 4 °C in the Eppendorf 5804 centrifuge (Germany). The supernatant was collected and together with a water subsample after filtration process were evaporated to dryness in the SC110A Speedvac ® Plus, ThermoSavant (Holbrook, NY, USA). The samples were redissolved in 500 μL of 75% aqueous methanol and filtered through a Gelman GHP Acrodisc 13 mm syringe filter with a 0.45 μm GHP membrane and minispike outlet (East Hills, NY, USA). A chromatographic separation was performed using an Agilent (Waldbronn, Germany) 1100 series HPLC system consisting of a degasser, a quaternary pump, a column compartment thermostat set at 40 °C, and a diode array detector operated at 200–300 nm on a Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) Purospher STAR RP-18e column (250 mm × 4 mm I.D. with 5 μm particles) protected by a 4 mm × 4 mm guard column. The mobile phase consisted of water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), both containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid. The flow rate was 1 mL/min with the following linear gradient program: 25% B at 0 min, 70% B at 5 min, 70% B at 6 min, 25% B at 6.10 min; stop time, 9 min. The injection volume was 20 μL. The content of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and microcystin-RR (MC-RR) in the samples was analyzed by comparing the retention time and UV spectrum (200–300 nm with an absorption maximum at 238 nm). For calibration of the HPLC analysis, commercial standards of MCs (EnzoLife Sci.) were used. Metagenomic analysis At the end of the experimental run, the biomass from the reactor was analyzed metagenomically (V3-V4 of 16S rRNA) for bacterial community. The collected biomass was stored at − 20 °C until analysis. For the isolation of genomic DNA, Genomic Mini AX Bacteria + kit (A&A Biotechnology, Poland) was applied. The FastPrep-24 homogenizer and zirconia beads were used to perform mechanical cell lysis. The PCR was carried out applying Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (New England Biolabs, United Kingdom). Dedicated primer sequences 314F (TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG) and 785R (GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC) were used to amplify the selected region. Amplification, indexing as well as library quantification were executed on an Illumina MiSeq system in accordance to the procedure of ""16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation"" with Q5 High-Fidelity Polymerase applied as the only modification method. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was conducted on a MiSeq apparatus, in 2 × 300 paired-ends, using the Illumina v3 kit (Illumina, USA). Bioinformatic analysis ensuring the classification of reads to the species level was performed with the QIIME 2 software package based on Silva 138 (reference sequence database). Metagenomic data stored in fastq format has been deposited to the NCBI database. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) tool was used to create a bioproject with accession number of PRJNA922144, and generated BioSampleAcc. number of SAMN32643820. The 16S rRNA gene fragments were matched to the appropriate taxonomical levels (from phylum to species) in order to determine phylogenetic microbial diversity. Statistical analysis The measurements were conducted in triplicates and results were expressed as mean value ± standard deviation. Mean values, standard deviation, error bars and the analysis of correlation were determined in Microsoft Excel 365 (version 2211). Results and discussion Characteristic of liquid digestate The composition of liquid digestate is depicted in Table 1 . The liquid was characterized by alkaline pH, typical for plant waste digestate 32 , and COD greater than that typically reported in the literature 33 . It also contained a significant concentration of nitrates (1020 mg/L) and orthophosphates (350 mg/L). The analysis for metals showed the highest concentration of zinc (15.04 mg/L) and lowest content of iron (4.07 mg/L). The digestate was also characterized by relatively low salinity with 217 mg/L of chlorides and 1.5 mg/L of sulfides. Photobioreactor performance The liquid digestate treatment process was evaluated based on the removal rates of nutrients and organic carbon (expressed in COD). Changes in pH, nitrogen, orthophosphates, total and soluble COD are shown in Fig. 2 . Characteristics of effluent collected from the bioreactor and pollutant removal rates are shown in Table 2 . Figure 2 Changes in pH ( a ), orthophosphates ( b ), nitrogen ( c ), COD ( d ), turbidity and TSS ( e ) in the photobioreactor effluent. Full size image Table 2 Characteristics of the effluent from the photobioreactor and the pollutants removal efficiency in the steady state period. Full size table Removal of phosphates Phosphorus plays a significant role in the growth and energy metabolism of microalgae. Microalgae mainly use inorganic phosphates and transform them into organic compounds by the process of phosphorylation 34 . In the 3N-BBM medium used for initial cultivation of microalgae, phosphorous was supplied with K 2 HPO 4 and KH 2 PO 4 , salts known as one of the most bioavailable sources of this nutrient for microalgae 35 . Regarding the liquid digestate used in the study, the phosphorous concentration (calculated based on orthophosphates) remained below the threshold value of 0.179 g/L reported in the literature to be inhibitory for microalgae 36 . It can be hypothesized that an increased removal rate of phosphate could be due to a generally high initial concentration of this nutrient. This phenomenon is known as “luxury phosphorous uptake”, which relies on greater phosphate accumulation by microorganisms cultivated under stressful conditions as described previously 37 , 38 . During the experimental run, the pH value in the effluent remained at approximately 8 for the first 6 weeks. After this period, a decrease in pH was observed, which corresponded with a drop in orthophosphates. This further indicates that removal of phosphates resulted from microbial uptake rather than precipitation 34 . The most noticeable phosphate decrease strongly corresponded with the significant growth of microalgae reported between the 5th and 11th week. In the same time, an intensive development of cyanobacteria (and probably bacteria) was also observed. It should be noted that these microorganisms usually exhibit higher ability to fix phosphorous than microalgae 39 , 40 . After reaching steady state (8–15 weeks), the average concentration of orthophosphates dropped to 95.1 ± 7.3 mg/L (Fig. 2 b) and the calculated removal rate for this period was 72.8 ± 2.1%. The removal rate of phosphates was therefore greater than that reported in the previous experiments described by Sobolewska et al. 10 . This could have been influenced by the appearance of cyanobacteria Desmonostoc sp., which could enhance the treatment process (further discussed in “ Biomass parameters monitoring ” and “ Relative abundance of microbial community in bioreactor ”). Higher removal rates of 78.3 ± 1.1% were reported by Sayedin et al. 41 describing the treatment of thin stillage anaerobic digestate by microalgae. However, the cited authors investigated diluted liquid digestate after preliminary struvite recovery. In another study, the liquid digestate from maize silage and distillery stillage anaerobic processing was subjected to biological treatment using two microalgal species 42 . The authors used centrifugation/distillation and dilution as pretreatments and achieved 94.2% and 70.4–87.4% phosphorous removal rates for Arthrospira platensis and Chlorella vulgaris, respectively. In contrast, Deng et al. 43 treated sterilized anaerobic digestate from swine manure reaching 20.0–29.7% of total phosphorous removal. Nitrogen removal Nitrogen is a nutrient necessary for the growth and metabolic processes of all living organisms. Eukaryotic microalgae assimilate inorganic nitrogen in the form of ammonium, nitrates and nitrites while cyanobacteria can also transform atmospheric nitrogen 34 , 44 . Although nitrates are a preferred nitrogen source, ammonium nitrogen is usually assimilated by microalgae faster 45 , 46 . The ability to assimilate various nitrogen forms or their inhibitory concentrations are species and strain dependent 47 . In the 3N-BBM medium, ammonium nitrogen was not present (NaNO 3 used as a primary nitrogen source), while in digestate both ammonium nitrogen and nitrates were. An increased ammonium concentration could potentially inhibit the microalgal growth, however, in the previous study reported by Sobolewska et al. 10 , the Microglena sp., Tetradesmus obliquus , and Desmodesmus subspicatus consortium could successfully grow in the same substrate. The concentration of nitrates showed a slightly increasing trend throughout the entire run, whereas ammonium nitrogen increased up to 6th week, and then dropped. From the 8th week of the experimental run, both nitrogen forms remained at relative constant levels suggesting stabilization of the process (steady-state operation). After the 6th week of the experiment, a simultaneous decrease in both pH and ammonium nitrogen concentration was reported (Fig. 2 a,c) suggesting the possible occurrence of nitrification. The presence of nitrifying bacteria within the reactor community was also confirmed in the metagenomic analysis. However, as dissolved oxygen and/or CO 2 /carbonates were not measured, it cannot be unambiguously confirmed that nitrification was the main process, which contributed to nitrogen removal. Apart from nitrification, ammonium nitrogen could have been removed through its microbial assimilation by bacteria and microalgae as well as cyanobacteria. The activity of nitrifying bacteria contributes to the reduction of free ammonia concentration, which might be toxic to microalgae. Hence, the coexistence of microalgae and nitrifying bacteria could increase the removal rate of nitrogen and overall bioreactor performance as reported previously 14 , 48 . Considering the steady-state operation, nitrogen was removed in 89.3 ± 0.5%, and its average concentration in the effluent was 73.4 ± 3.8 mgN/L. Lower treatment efficiency was reported by Xu et al. 49 for piggery anaerobic liquid digestate. It should be noted that authors used initial substrate sterilization and dilution achieving total nitrogen removal rates of 58.39–74.63%. Pizzera et al. 17 investigated diluted liquid agro-digestate treated by Chlorellaceae and Scenedesmaceae reaching 20 ± 29% total nitrogen removal rates. In contrast, Khalid et al. 50 achieved 96% NH 4 + removal rates for recycled, sterilized agricultural wastewater. A similar treatment efficiency was also demonstrated by Sayedin et al. 41 . COD and TSS changes Carbon, along with nitrogen and phosphorus, is an important component used by microalgae. It can be consumed either directly in the form of soluble carbonates, or converted into carbon dioxide and then utilized through photosynthesis 34 . Although some microalgae can directly assimilate organic carbon 51 , the removal of organic substances is mainly due to bacterial activity in mixed cultures. On the other hand, microalgae can provide oxygen necessary for decomposition of organic substances by bacteria, which, in turn, release carbon dioxide used by photosynthetic organisms 44 , 52 . The observed COD reduction was therefore associated with the activity of both co-existing microbial groups. As shown in Fig. 2 d, a sharp decrease in total and soluble COD was observed after the first week of the treatment process. From the third week, the values of total and soluble COD remained at a constant low level of 1687.5 ± 482.9 mgO 2 /L and 696.9 ± 128.0 mgO 2 /L, respectively. For that period, the calculated sCOD removal rate exceeded 90% while the corresponding value for tCOD was 79%. Zhu et al. 53 noted lower efficiency for non-sterilized dairy liquid digestate (DLD) but the authors employed axenic cultures of Chlorella vulgaris. They observed that with increasing DLD load, the sCOD removal rate also increased from 1.5% (25% DLD) to 32.2% (100% DLD). The sCOD removal rate of 29 ± 17% was reached by Pizzera et al. 17 , who investigated diluted liquid digestate from agricultural waste processing. Likewise, Wang et al. 54 treated diluted dairy manure digestate using wild-type microalgae. Depending on the dilution used, the sCOD removal rates of 27.4–38.4% were achieved. Bankston and Higgins 18 showed that axenic cultures of Chlorella sorokiniana and Auxenochlorella protothecoides cultivated on diluted, sterilized digestate may increase soluble COD whereas the presence of anaerobic digestion microorganisms suppress this effect to a small extent. In contrast to COD, turbidity and especially TSS showed an increasing trend throughout the experiment (Fig. 2 e). Turbidity is directly influenced by light dispersion resulting from the presence of colloids, suspended particles, pollutants and microorganisms 55 . This may also explain the correlation between turbidity, optical density and the abundance of microalgae (which form colloidal structures) as illustrated in Fig. 3 . Although all microorganisms can influenced turbidity and TSS, it seems that cyanobacteria and microalgae were mainly responsible for this since a correlation between chlorophyll a concentration (Fig. 3 a), TSS and turbidity was noticed. Biomass productivity, calculated as a function of TSS (see “ Chemical and physical analyses ”) was recorded at 11 mg/L/day. Given the proper separation of treated effluent, the remaining biomass can be valorized to generate biofuels or other value-added products (pigments, nutraceuticals, fertilizers) 56 , 57 . Figure 3 Changes in optical density, chlorophyll a concentration ( a ) and percentage share of particular taxa of microalgae and cyanobacteria ( b ). Full size image Biomass parameters monitoring During the experimental run, the growth of microalgal biomass was monitored with optical density, chlorophyll a concentration and cell count determinations (Fig. 3 ). After initial cultivation, for the first 7 weeks Tetradesmus obliquus followed by Microglena sp. were the most abundant microalgae. Then, the number of T. obliquus cells gradually decreased, which corresponded to a pH drop below 7. The growth of T. obliquus is strongly dependent on environmental pH with the optimal value close to 7. Lower pH may result in cell division inhibition 21 , 58 . Simultaneously, from the 8th week, the growth of heterocytous bacteria was also observed. The morphological features of trichomes allowed to predict the Nostoc sensu lato group. However, molecular analysis (BLASTn) confirmed the presence of Desmonostoc species with 100% coverage and 100% identity to Desmonostoc sp. PCC7422 (HG004586). As the digestate used in this study had not been subjected to pre-treatment processes (see “ Liquid digestate ”), it contained various native microorganisms. It can therefore be assumed that singular Desmonostoc sp. cells were introduced to the bioreactor along with the digestate, and their rapid multiplication was accelerated by the temperature increase and pH drop 59 . For example, Desmonostoc muscorum was observed in soils at pH below 5.0 60 . In general, representatives of this genus prefer slightly acidic to neutral environment (pH 5.3 up to 7.0) 61 . A rapid growth of cyanobacteria was reflected by an increase in optical density, chlorophyll a concentration, as well as TSS and turbidity. A strong correlation between these indicators (R > 0.85) was found. Although it is commonly believed that cyanobacteria can produce toxins hazardous for other organisms, their release is usually strain dependent 62 . Cyanotoxins can be released during water treatment processes as a result of mechanical and chemical stress factors 63 . For instance, the use of aluminum sulfate or chlorine dioxide for water and wastewater treatment can contribute to the lysis of cyanobacteria cells and caused the release of microcystins into water as demonstrated for full-scale applications 64 , 65 . However, a HPLC–DAD analysis (described in “ Determination of microcystins ”) confirmed the absence of MC-LR and MC-RR microcystins in the analyzed samples. Moreover, the presence of blue-green algae can also facilitate bioremediation and biomass generation, which can be further processed to value added products 66 . Relative abundance of microbial community in bioreactor Metagenomic analysis of the biomass collected at the end of the experimental run allowed to assess the microbial community (bacteria and archaea) present in the photobioreactor. The community was dominated by Cyanobacteria (37.59%) and Proteobacteria (34.96%) phyla followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota and Bacteroidota. Within the Cyanobacteria phylum, 27% of relative abundance was attributed to Desmonostoc sp. and 5% to Tetradesmus obliquus green algae, which were reported to grow under harsh environmental conditions, utilizing recalcitrant substances and nutrients 59 , 67 . Degradation of organic substances, reflected by a COD decrease can be linked to the activity of bacteria, especially those attributed to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteriota phyla 68 . Moreover, numerous species of Proteobacteria are known to remove phosphorous and nitrogen from wastewater 69 . The removal of phosphates can also be linked to the appearance of bacteria belonging to the Chloroflexi phylum 70 . On the other hand, nitrogen transformation could have been influenced by Rhizobiales (14.63% relative abundance). Within this order, Beijerinckiaceae , Rhizobiaceae and Xanthobacteraceae were the dominant families, and these microbes could be responsible for nitrogen fixation and denitrification 71 , 72 . Salinarimonas sp. (4.29% of relative abundance) is known to grow in the pH range of 6–9, utilizes nitrates as a nitrogen source and is commonly found in substrates such as soil or piggery derived digestates 73 , 74 . Other denitrifying bacteria belonged to Rhodanobacter sp. within the Xanthomonadales order (10.45% relative abundance), and were previously reported to easily adapt to nitrogen-rich environments and low pH 75 . Furthermore, the appearance of Sporosarcina sp. ( Planococcaceae ) along with Ferruginibacter sp. ( Chitinophagaceae ) could enhance both nitrogen and COD removal as these bacteria are capable of simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and organic matter degradation 76 . Other bacteria detected belonged to the Sphingomonadaceae family with Sandaracinobacter sp. being the most abundant and Comamonadaceae dominated by Comamonas sp. A photoheterotrophic bacteria Sandaracinobacter sp. has been described as capable of degrading various organic compounds and growing at pH of 6–8. Species of these bacteria were previously found in soil, freshwater or sludge 77 , 78 , 79 . Comamonas sp., has been previously reported to reduce nitrites and accumulate polyphosphates 48 , 80 (Fig. 4 ). Figure 4 Microbial community of the reactor biomass at an order and family level. Full size image The majority of detected bacteria and cyanobacteria (i.e., Desmonostoc sp., Salinarimonas sp., Rhodanobacter sp., Sporosarcina sp, Sandaracinobacter sp., Nitrosomonas sp., Nitrospira sp., Nitrosospira sp.) inhabit environments within the pH range of 6–9 and are commonly found in digestates or agricultural substrates 59 , 67 , 73 , 74 , 75 , 77 , 78 , 79 , 81 . Bacteria native for the raw substrate did not directly influence the microalgal population as chlorophyll a concentration did not change with digestate feeding (Fig. 3 a). It is believed that microalgae–bacteria consortia are more suitable for digestate treatment than axenic or non-axenic monocultures. During photosynthesis, microalgae produce oxygen used by aerobic bacteria for mineralization of organic compounds. In turn, native bacteria provide carbon dioxide necessary for microalgae. Higher pollutant treatment efficiency can be therefore achieved through such the symbiosis 12 , 13 , 14 . Conclusions This study demonstrated that microalgae, bacteria and non-toxic cyanobacteria can be successfully used for the treatment of undiluted and unsterilized liquid digestate. For steady state period, nitrogen and phosphate removal rates reached 89.3 ± 0.5% and 72.8 ± 2.1% respectively. Furthermore, total COD was reduced by 78.9 ± 6.0% whereas soluble COD was lowered by 91.2 ± 1.6%. A significant pH change contributed to the rapid development of cyanobacteria, however nutrient removal efficiency remained at a relatively constant level. No MC-LR and MC-RR microcystin were detected. The investigation also proved that unsterilized, non-diluted liquid digestate can be successfully treated by a mixed consortium of microalgae, cyanobacteria and bacteria, and the growth of the latter two groups can enhance the treatment efficiency, especially the removal of nutrients. Further research is needed to find symbiotic relationships between microalgae, cyanobacteria and bacteria as well as mechanisms of contaminant removal at a proteolytic and metabolomic levels.

To that end, the Service coordinated with the state of North Carolina (including the North Carolina Department of Water Resources and the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission), the Lake Mattamuskeet Watershed Restoration Technical Working Group, the University of North Carolina Institute of Marine Sciences, and other interested parties to develop an Environmental Assessment (EA) to evaluate a pilot study to treat cyanobacteria in Lake Mattamuskeet at Mattamuskeet NWR in Hyde County, North Carolina. The pilot study supports the refuge’s Comprehensive Conservation Plan (USFWS 2008) and Habitat Management Plan (USFWS 2018) and supports the Lake Mattamuskeet Watershed Restoration Plan (North Carolina Coastal Federation 2019) by seeking to improve water quality and clarity within Lake Mattamuskeet. Lake Mattamuskeet is a 40,276-acre lake that dominates the 50,180-acre refuge. The Service is dedicated to management of the lake to support wildlife, including birds, fish, and invertebrates. Due to excess sediment and nutrients flowing into the lake from the surrounding landscape, reduced flow to Pamlico Sound, and an overabundance of invasive common carp ( Cyprinus carpio ), lake conditions began to decline in the early 1990s with declining water quality and clarity and increasing turbidity. Necessary to support lake health and serve wildlife needs, submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) also declined to the point that, by 2017, Service staff were unable to locate a single plant. The SAV was the primary food source for wintering waterfowl in the area, historically providing over 34 million energy use days of forage. Collectively, annual wintering waterfowl populations on the lake would sometimes exceed 200,000 ducks, geese, and swans. In 2020, during a revision to update waterfowl objectives for the refuge, calculations determined that the absence of SAV and associated invertebrates and seeds in the lake, compared to values from the literature, resulted in the lake’s loss of over 20 million energy use days for waterfowl. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the Service continues to work with partners to research and recommend solutions for improving conditions in the lake and watershed. Recently, the Lake Mattamuskeet Watershed Restoration Technical Working Group was successful with the award of a $1 million Large Invasive Species Grant for the removal of carp from Lake Mattamuskeet. The North Carolina Coastal Federation was successful in being awarded a Regional Conservation Partnership Program grant from the Natural Resources Conservation Service to reduce sedimentation and nutrient transfer to the lake. The refuge is also exploring other possible projects within the refuge that could reduce sediments entering the lake or otherwise help improve water quality. As another potential tool to address these shared concerns, the Service evaluated the pilot study considered in the EA, for a treatment of cyanobacteria also known as blue-green algae. The treatment would use a sodium percarbonate-based algaecide, Lake Guard® Oxy, in 4 bays on ~400 acres, or 1% of Lake Mattamuskeet. In September 2023, the Service requested public review and comment on the draft EA for the proposed pilot study. The Service received comments from 6 state agencies, the Catawba Indian Nation, several organizations, and 230 individuals. The Service thoroughly reviewed all comments received in development of the final EA. In response, the Service updated the final EA to provide clarifications and additional information, including the listed items. Added clarification that the method of application of Lake Guard® Oxy will be by boat only. Added details on restrictions limiting the timing of application to periods of low or no waterfowl abundance to minimize potential impacts on waterfowl. Added more detail on requiring continuous observations during pilot study treatments to monitor potential wildlife response. Added clarification regarding hazing of birds during pilot study treatments to minimize adverse impacts. Added bird toxicity testing results. Added clarification regarding the scope of the action and potential adverse and beneficial impacts. With these added clarifications to the existing measures outlined in the draft EA, the Service has incorporated restrictions to application of Lake Guard® Oxy during the pilot study trial treatment to minimize and avoid potential negative impacts on wildlife and the ecosystem. The potential beneficial effects of the pilot study in the treated bays would include a temporary increase in water clarity as a result of reduced levels of cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins for five to seven weeks in the pilot study area following each treatment and a potential increase in beneficial phytoplankton communities, such as beneficial green algae. The results of this pilot study treatment and its impact on increasing water clarity would be influential in the efforts to restore SAV to the lakebed, which would provide essential habitat for fish and other aquatic life and an important food source for waterfowl. Given the limited scope of the project at 400 acres (1% of the lake), the pilot study nature of the action, measures included to minimize impacts, the included Monitoring Plan, and the analysis in the EA and Section 7 Section 7 Section 7 Consultation
The Endangered Species Act (ESA) directs all Federal agencies to work to conserve endangered and threatened species and to use their authorities to further the purposes of the Act. Section 7 of the Act, called ""Interagency Cooperation,"" is the mechanism by which Federal agencies ensure the actions they take, including those they fund or authorize, do not jeopardize the existence of any listed species. Learn more about Section 7 which find no significant beneficial or adverse impacts, the Service finds that a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is the appropriate next step and an Environmental Impact Statement is not warranted. The final EA and FONSI only authorize the pilot study with the application of Lake Guard® Oxy limited to 4 bays. The Service intends to implement the pilot study in April 2024 with monitoring by the Service, BlueGreen Water Technologies, and the University of North Carolina. Results of these monitoring efforts will be reviewed to better understand the beneficial and adverse impacts, the effectiveness of measures to minimize impacts, the effectiveness to control cyanobacteria, and lake and wildlife responses. If this tool is determined to be successful, any future consideration of its use on the refuge would be required to meet all applicable laws, regulations, and policies, including the National Environmental Policy Act and other compliance and permitting requirements. The final EA for the pilot study, including the Service’s Response to Comments Appendix and the FONSI, is available at the link below.

(Jesse Costa/WBUR) Warm weather and sunlight are attracting more than just summer vacationers to ponds in Massachusetts. These conditions are also contributing to ""blooms"" of cyanobacteria that public health officials warn can be harmful to humans and pets. This week, harmful blooms were detected in nine Massachusetts ponds, prompting the state to issue an updated advisory. On July 26, the advisory was updated again to 11 ponds and one lake. Experts including from the EPA and the Centers for Disease Control say climate change increases the occurrence of these harmful blooms in the U.S. Studies point to bodies of water used for recreation in the Northeast as among the areas at risk of these blooms. “Warmer water coupled with the sunlight in the summer is just a perfect breeding ground for them,” said Lucia Ross, chief marketing officer at BlueGreen Water Technologies, a company that works to reduce cyanobacteria. While algal blooms are not always toxic, experts warn that cyanobacteria blooms in particular are a cause for concern. They can release “cyanotoxins” that — when touched, ingested or inhaled — can cause stomach aches and other illnesses. Cyanobacteria are found naturally in all types of water , but blooms signal an unbalanced growth that usually happens when they feed off nutrients from fertilizer and human and animal waste runoff. Ross adds that cyanobacteria thrive in still water and, when exposed to sun, can double in size every five hours. “So that biomass will keep getting larger and larger,” she said. According to the CDC, climate change can “make blooms occur more often and be more severe.” Hot weather driven mainly by climate change has caused record-high temperatures across the globe. Last month was the hottest June ever recorded on Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In Massachusetts, the number of cyanobacteria blooms typically peaks between August and October, according to the state Department of Public Health. But state data shows the blooms appear earlier in the year: Between Jan. 1 and July 21, the department was aware of 16 harmful cyanobacteria advisories issued in 2023. In 2022, 23 advisories were issued over the same time period. Blooms often appear as extra cloudy water or greenish foam or scum floating on the surface. The CDC says it’s not possible to tell if a bloom is toxic just by looking at it. But the the Massachusetts Department of Public Health says it is best practice to assume all cyanobacteria blooms pose a health risk, so people should stay away if they see one, whether or not an advisory has been issued.

Hey, all. So, I’ve got an approx 1 year old tank, started it with a mix of various frags after the bacteria-in-a-bottle start. It’s a little IM AIO Lagoon, 25 gallons. It reached the point where the coral was surviving but not ‘thriving’—also had a spontaneous colony of pods that was fat and health, they eventually died off. 

Turns out, there were NO nutrients in the tank (I did give the occasional reef roids feeding).  So, finally added a fish (purple firefish). I feed it the frozen brine shrimp (I just shave a little from the cube, but what he’ll eat), but I notice everywhere I dump it in, there is cyano all over that specific spot next day. 

TL;DR version: recommendation for a fish food that leaves less garbage behind? (Yes I know there is a limit to that btw nature). Thanks!

I’d be grateful for advice. I have an established 250L mixed reef (8+ years) and for the last six weeks I’ve been struggling with diatoms and Cyanobacteria. 

Parameters at the last test (also confirmed with an external ICP test):
- PH 8.0
- SG 1.025
- KH 7 (dose every other day, always runs between 7-8 and has done for 8 years)
- Ammonia <0.05
- Nitrite 0.05 
- Nitrate 1
- Phosphate <0.02
- Silicate <0.1
- Calcium 440 
- Magnesium 1280

I dose Seachem fusion 1 and 2 every other day, have done for about a year. 

I run carbon and Rowaphos, no changes in how I run them or batch of either. 

UV unit is definitely working (indicator light says so anyway). 

Lights are LEDs (Juwel Multilux - has to be a closed top tank because otherwise the cat climbs in it). Have been running for four years, same bulbs. 

Fish are all fine. Corals mostly fine, have lost a few heads of Euphyllia over the duration but everything else is fine (lots of euphyllia, stylophora, Duncan, blasto, candy cane, acropora, favia and toadstool all fine). 

Nothing has changed that I can think would induce the bloom. Things I’ve tried so far and seen no improvement:

- Changed UV unit bulb and cleaned inside unit. 
- Rinsed filter media (always done on schedule and sponges changed regularly on schedule, no difference over last 8 years) and cleaned pipes. 
- Sequential 10% water changes daily for a week (including vacuuming of the sand bed). 
- 60% water change. 
- Added more clean up crew (4 weeks ago, no change)
- Salt batch is the same as I’ve been using for 8 months but I changed it as a precaution, still no improvement. 
- Changed RO/DI resin and membranes, no improvement (TDS 0).
- Filter bacteria addition. 
- Tried various angles of circulation and wave pumps, no change. 
- Reduced light cycle by two hours, no change. 

I’m at a bit of a loss for what to do. Has anyone got any suggestions?

As the call for sustainable and plant-based alternatives to traditional animal products grows louder, researchers at the University of Copenhagen are exploring a unique solution involving blue-green algae, specifically cyanobacteria. In a recent study led by Professor Poul Erik Jensen of the Department of Food Science, the team demonstrated the potential of cyanobacteria to produce a protein with fibrous strands resembling the texture of meat fibers. This breakthrough could pave the way for sustainable, protein-rich foods with minimal processing, addressing environmental concerns and the quest for the right mouthfeel in plant-based products.

Cyanobacteria, often known as blue-green algae, have been manipulated to produce a protein not naturally found in their composition. By inserting foreign genes into cyanobacteria, the researchers observed the protein organizing itself into fibrous strands or nanofibers. This fibrous structure holds promise for mimicking the texture of meat, cheese, or other desired food products.

110,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18bhjj7,How to rid Cyanobacteria?,"Hi, all!

This is my girlfriend’s tank that’s been housing a betta and 2 mystery snails for over a year now (10 gal). 

Only problem is we started college back in September, things got very busy and she started to neglect cleaning the tank. It went from weekly water changes to once every 2-3 weeks though I encouraged her to do it more often, the water remained clear as day and the plants seems to keep the nitrates low enough that the livestock weren’t at risk. 

However, after a little this slimy blue-green algae started to take over very fast. I got her to get an air pump, lower the lights, etc. this has worked for the most part but it’s still around and we can eradicate it 100%. I lives in the substrate and just keeps slowly growing back. 

The tank is kept at around 75f, no nitrates/nitrites/ammonia. gH and kH are a little high but I can’t do anything about that, we have slightly hard water and can’t afford an RODI system. 

I’ve tried all the google suggestions I can find but I’m wondering if there’s any product additive that would work to kill this stuff without harming the livestock or the ecosystem?

Thanks!",05 Dec 2023 12:41:17,reddit

I have been battling Cyanobacteria for months now. Please see [pictures of tank and microscope pictures](https://imgur.com/a/UYFp0Dh)

Here are my parameters measured this morning.

Ammonia 0
Nitrite 0
Nitrate 5
Phosphate 0.00
PH 8.2

It used to be manageable, until all my GSP do not come out anymore, and my torches, hammers, and anemones are shrunk throughout the day. The fishes are fine. 

Since the discovery of Cyano, i have tried many things, including,

1. shortening the light schedule to 1-8-1.

2. measure PAR to make sure my light isn't too strong. it measured 50~150 from bottom to top. 

3. Applied chemiclean and siphon out/carboned out after 3 days. This did resolve it, but it quickly came back within 2 days. I have since then tried redosing chemiclean, and didn't see any results even 3 days after dosing. 

4. I realize that my phosphate is bottomed out, and I have been dosing Neophos without any measureable change according to Hanna LR checker

5. Dosing microbacteria 7

I need some guidance on what to do next. Should I give up on chemiclean and just try to continue adjusting phosphate? I don't want to overdose phosphate? Looking forward to any tips. Thank you.",13 Jul 2023 13:02:22,reddit

126,https://i.redd.it/71o8fh2j8opb1.jpg,Cyanobacteria bloom awareness,"I’m a swamp lover in the north east of Germany, and we have been witnessing a crazy increase in dangerous cyanobacterial bloom here, and all over Germany. This extends to a lot of parts of the world, setting new records of such blooms, due to rising temperatures and stuff like fertilizer and septic tanks seeping into the ground wherever there is aggressive industrial agriculture and human settlement around. I’ve seen some posts here that also looked like this, so I am hoping to spread a bit of awareness and attention to this very dangerous toxic event. 

Please find your local information on cyanobacterial blooms in your area and when you see it, please exercise caution, don’t touch it, breathe in the fumes etc.!! There may also be a monitoring place in your area you can report this to. 

It only takes a quick online search to learn how to identify it, and there are plenty of interesting satellite images on how it looks like and is spreading throughout the world. 

If you can, please join efforts to keep our nature healthy and clean, through rewilding efforts or advocacy for climate justice and safeguarding policies for all of our ecosystems. 


“Abundant growth of cyanobacteria in freshwater, estuarine, and coastal ecosystems due to increased anthropogenic eutrophication and global climate change has created serious concern toward harmful bloom formation and surface water contamination all over the world. Cyanobacterial blooms and the accumulation of several cyanotoxins in water bodies pose severe ecological consequences with high risk to aquatic organisms and global public health.”

127,https://www.reddit.com/r/aquarium/comments/191axbz/cyanobacteria_my_early_journey/,Cyanobacteria - my early journey,"The attached video is from earlier in my tank. I think I might have had an anaerobic growth of cyanobacteria under the sand that you can see around 48-50 seconds into the video. I removed about 20 pounds of sand today and did a manual cleaning. I'm looking for more advice/insight or discussion to help others learn how to identify and how to treat. Obviously, also maybe what not to do...

In the past week I had some green looking algae on the sand. My siamese algae eaters and the snails have been avoiding it. I went researching and I saw a post on Reddit about algae on sand, and it was identified as cyanobacteria. 

Here is what I gleaned from research: 

* Manually remove as much of this as possible from surfaces. 
* Thrives in the water column. Can also be anaerobic.
* Can be a result of over feeding or too much light. 
* Discussions about phosphorous and nitrate imbalance, mostly phosphorous in excess
* UV can be used to cleanse the water but without manual removal consider it could be futile
* Antibiotics (ethromycin) can be helpful, but again nothing happens without manual removal. 
* Other green slime treatments folks swear by
* Cool article about managing the phosphorous level but I'm too novice to try all the math, nitrite and phosphorous level calculations today while this crap is actively a problem in my tank. I'll call it #AquariumHusbandryGoals
* Talk of a smell (my water smells like clean water)
* Scrub pieces of decor with a tooth brush to remove

Anyhoo - today I planned to do as much manual removal as I could. I used my python to clean the sand.

* I think I found an anaerobic pocket as I found a big area of sand that I could not get clean from in the tank so I removed it (about 20# of sand if dry) and cleaned it in a bucket until the water ran clear. It is not back in the tank yet. 
   * InFact, I think I had it early in my tank and I have seen it and wondered what it was - but I did not take it seriously until it manifested on the surface. This is my novice. 
   * There is a smell - like lake water when it has turned rancid or something toward the shore. A small bit fishy but just like warm canal water. Even after a shower I can't stop smelling it today. I'm a nurse, this happens sometimes. I hate it though.
* Took out all the decor, and cleaned what I could. Could not return 2 pieces of dragon stone, nor 3 pieces of decor for the smell. 

I ran a toothbrush and melamine sponge over the other items 

* The 3D printed items came clean enough I placed them back in the tank. 
* The dragon stone with visible algae and a smell got soaked in vinegar. 
* The three pieces of decor had no visible or no significant blue/green look but had the most pungent smell. 
   * All I had on hand was cleaning vinegar and bleach. My bleach has additives so to me vinegar was the safest option to try to remove the odor and growth on the items that did not come clean. 

The UV light is now 'on' in my canister filter to treat the water column. 

Plan another superficial vacuum tomorrow and check for any more pockets. Have cut my light significantly. Floating plants are in my indoor staging pond as I will be conducting more cleanings and want the extra floating and water column plants out of the way so I can clean more efficiently over the next several days. 

Fish are all okay, but they have become accustomed to me in the tank top or bottom, right or left so we did our little dance today and they seem pretty happy and not too stressed after less than 10 minutes after me ending in-tank efforts. I do hand feed a few so they followed me around like - hey mom - what are you doing? Got any pellets for me? \*lol\* 

What else do I need to do or consider? Otherwise, consider this an opportunity to discuss (or research and learn) on what it is to see and treat this bacteria. 

\*oof, I am tired today\*
