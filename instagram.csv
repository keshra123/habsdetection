A new research study recently published in the Journal of Environmental Management is the first ecosystem-scale assessment of losses to tourism-related businesses during a harmful algae bloom (HAB).

Funded by NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science and led by UCF Rosen College’s own Sergio Alvarez, the study revealed that the impacts of HABs on tourism are not driven solely by biophysical elements, but are mediated and amplified by social elements like information and media coverage. The 2018 Florida red tide, resulting in approximately $2.7 billion in tourism losses, emphasizes the need to view harmful red algae blooms as potential billion-dollar disasters.
