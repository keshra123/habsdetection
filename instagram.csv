An increase of toxic algae has been noticed in our lakes and rivers this summer, particularly in the central North Island. 🏞️

Cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae, love to grow in warm, calm waters, especially shallow lakes and slow-moving rivers and streams when the weather is hot. ☀️

Blue-green algae play a crucial role in our ecosystem but become a problem in high concentrations because of the toxins they produce. These toxins can be harmful to people and animals.

👀 Keep an eye out for lakes or ponds that are discoloured, cloudy or murky, especially if blue-green in colour or with scum on the water’s surface or edge.

🏞️ In rivers, toxic algae generally form brown or black mats that grow on rocks. There may also be a strong odour.

🐶 Be mindful of the water your pets are swimming in and drinking from and keep an eye out for any warnings in your area.

The Public Health Department of Seattle and King County said toxic algae was recently found in Lake Washington, Green Lake, and Lake Wilderness, “and it may be impacting other lakes, ponds and streams in King County.” The health department is cautioning people to keep their dogs and pets away from the water with visible algae blooms and to now allow pets to drink the water or get it on their fur.
 
People should follow “posted guidance” at parks and beaches and avoid getting in the water where you can see algae or an advisory is posted, the health department said.
 
“Remember—when in doubt, stay out.”

In recent months, it has been more apparent in San Diego County waters. With rising ocean temperatures, we are seeing a rise in the number of occurrences of algae blooms in Southern California, and the number of events is only expected to increase through the summer and fall and into the future. 🐠🐬📈
